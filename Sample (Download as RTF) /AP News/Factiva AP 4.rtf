The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Text of President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's speech at the "Let Freedom Ring" ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, as provided by the White House:\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 To the King family, who have sacrificed and inspired so much; to President Clinton; President Carter; Vice President Biden and Jill; fellow Americans.\par \par \uc2 Five decades ago today, Americans came to this honored place to lay claim to a promise made at our founding: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."\par \par \uc2 In 1963, almost 200 years after those words were set to paper, a full century after a great war was fought and emancipation proclaimed, that promise -- those truths -- remained unmet. And so they came by the thousands from every corner of our country, men and women, young and old, blacks who longed for freedom and whites who could no longer accept freedom for themselves while witnessing the subjugation of others.\par \par \uc2 Across the land, congregations sent them off with food and with prayer. In the middle of the night, entire blocks of Harlem came out to wish them well. With the few dollars they scrimped from their labor, some bought tickets and boarded buses, even if they couldn't always sit where they wanted to sit. Those with less money hitchhiked or walked. They were seamstresses and steelworkers, students and teachers, maids and Pullman porters. They shared simple meals and bunked together on floors. And then, on a hot summer day, they assembled here, in our nation's capital, under the shadow of the Great Emancipator -- to offer testimony of injustice, to petition their government for redress, and to awaken America's long-slumbering conscience.\par \par \uc2 We rightly and best remember Dr. King's soaring oratory that day, how he gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions; how he offered a salvation path for oppressed and oppressors alike. His words belong to the ages, possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time.\par \par \uc2 But we would do well to recall that day itself also belonged to those ordinary people whose names never appeared in the history books, never got on TV. Many had gone to segregated schools and sat at segregated lunch counters. They lived in towns where they couldn't vote and cities where their votes didn't matter. They were couples in love who couldn't marry, soldiers who fought for freedom abroad that they found denied to them at home. They had seen loved ones beaten, and children fire-hosed, and they had every reason to lash out in anger, or resign themselves to a bitter fate.\par \par \uc2 And yet they chose a different path. In the face of hatred, they prayed for their tormentors. In the face of violence, they stood up and sat in, with the moral force of nonviolence. Willingly, they went to jail to protest unjust laws, their cells swelling with the sound of freedom songs. A lifetime of indignities had taught them that no man can take away the dignity and grace that God grants us. They had learned through hard experience what Frederick Douglass once taught -- that freedom is not given, it must be won, through struggle and discipline, persistence and faith.\par \par \uc2 That was the spirit they brought here that day. That was the spirit young people like John Lewis brought to that day. That was the spirit that they carried with them, like a torch, back to their cities and their neighborhoods. That steady flame of conscience and courage that would sustain them through the campaigns to come -- through boycotts and voter registration drives and smaller marches far from the spotlight; through the loss of four little girls in Birmingham, and the carnage of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and the agony of Dallas and California and Memphis. Through setbacks and heartbreaks and gnawing doubt, that flame of justice flickered; it never died.\par \par \uc2 And because they kept marching, America changed. Because they marched, a Civil Rights law was passed. Because they marched, a Voting Rights law was signed. Because they marched, doors of opportunity and education swung open so their daughters and sons could finally imagine a life for themselves beyond washing somebody else's laundry or shining somebody else's shoes. Because they marched, city councils changed and state legislatures changed, and Congress changed, and, yes, eventually, the White House changed.\par \par \uc2 Because they marched, America became more free and more fair -- not just for African Americans, but for women and Latinos, Asians and Native Americans; for Catholics, Jews, and Muslims; for gays, for Americans with a disability. America changed for you and for me. And the entire world drew strength from that example, whether the young people who watched from the other side of an Iron Curtain and would eventually tear down that wall, or the young people inside South Africa who would eventually end the scourge of apartheid.\par \par \uc2 Those are the victories they won, with iron wills and hope in their hearts. That is the transformation that they wrought, with each step of their well-worn shoes. That's the debt that I and millions of Americans owe those maids, those laborers, those porters, those secretaries; folks who could have run a company maybe if they had ever had a chance; those white students who put themselves in harm's way, even though they didn't have to; those Japanese Americans who recalled their own internment; those Jewish Americans who had survived the Holocaust; people who could have given up and given in, but kept on keeping on, knowing that "weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."\par \par \uc2 On the battlefield of justice, men and women without rank or wealth or title or fame would liberate us all in ways that our children now take for granted, as people of all colors and creeds live together and learn together and walk together, and fight alongside one another, and love one another, and judge one another by the content of our character in this greatest nation on Earth.\par \par \uc2 To dismiss the magnitude of this progress -- to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed -- that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years. Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, Martin Luther King Jr. -- they did not die in vain. Their victory was great.\par \par \uc2 But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete. The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn't bend on its own. To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency. Whether by challenging those who erect new barriers to the vote, or ensuring that the scales of justice work equally for all, and the criminal justice system is not simply a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails, it requires vigilance.\par \par \uc2 And we'll suffer the occasional setback. But we will win these fights. This country has changed too much. People of goodwill, regardless of party, are too plentiful for those with ill will to change history's currents.\par \par \uc2 In some ways, though, the securing of civil rights, voting rights, the eradication of legalized discrimination -- the very significance of these victories may have obscured a second goal of the March. For the men and women who gathered 50 years ago were not there in search of some abstract ideal. They were there seeking jobs as well as justice --not just the absence of oppression but the presence of economic opportunity.\par \par \uc2 For what does it profit a man, Dr. King would ask, to sit at an integrated lunch counter if he can't afford the meal? This idea -- that one's liberty is linked to one's livelihood; that the pursuit of happiness requires the dignity of work, the skills to find work, decent pay, some measure of material security -- this idea was not new. Lincoln himself understood the Declaration of Independence in such terms -- as a promise that in due time, "the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance."\par \par \uc2 And Dr. King explained that the goals of African Americans were identical to working people of all races: "Decent wages, fair working conditions, livable housing, old-age security, health and welfare measures, conditions in which families can grow, have education for their children, and respect in the community."\par \par \uc2 What King was describing has been the dream of every American. It's what's lured for centuries new arrivals to our shores. And it's along this second dimension -- of economic opportunity, the chance through honest toil to advance one's station in life -- where the goals of 50 years ago have fallen most short.\par \par \uc2 Yes, there have been examples of success within black America that would have been unimaginable a half century ago. But as has already been noted, black unemployment has remained almost twice as high as white unemployment, Latino unemployment close behind. The gap in wealth between races has not lessened, it's grown. And as President Clinton indicated, the position of all working Americans, regardless of color, has eroded, making the dream Dr. King described even more elusive.\par \par \uc2 For over a decade, working Americans of all races have seen their wages and incomes stagnate, even as corporate profits soar, even as the pay of a fortunate few explodes. Inequality has steadily risen over the decades. Upward mobility has become harder. In too many communities across this country, in cities and suburbs and rural hamlets, the shadow of poverty casts a pall over our youth, their lives a fortress of substandard schools and diminished prospects, inadequate health care and perennial violence.\par \par \uc2 And so as we mark this anniversary, we must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many blacks could join the ranks of millionaires. It was whether this country would admit all people who are willing to work hard regardless of race into the ranks of a middle-class life.\par \par \uc2 The test was not, and never has been, whether the doors of opportunity are cracked a bit wider for a few. It was whether our economic system provides a fair shot for the many -- for the black custodian and the white steelworker, the immigrant dishwasher and the Native American veteran. To win that battle, to answer that call -- this remains our great unfinished business.\par \par \uc2 We shouldn't fool ourselves. The task will not be easy. Since 1963, the economy has changed. The twin forces of technology and global competition have subtracted those jobs that once provided a foothold into the middle class -- reduced the bargaining power of American workers. And our politics has suffered. Entrenched interests, those who benefit from an unjust status quo, resisted any government efforts to give working families a fair deal -- marshaling an army of lobbyists and opinion makers to argue that minimum wage increases or stronger labor laws or taxes on the wealthy who could afford it just to fund crumbling schools, that all these things violated sound economic principles. We'd be told that growing inequality was a price for a growing economy, a measure of this free market; that greed was good and compassion ineffective, and those without jobs or health care had only themselves to blame.\par \par \uc2 And then, there were those elected officials who found it useful to practice the old politics of division, doing their best to convince middle-class Americans of a great untruth -- that government was somehow itself to blame for their growing economic insecurity; that distant bureaucrats were taking their hard-earned dollars to benefit the welfare cheat or the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And then, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that during the course of 50 years, there were times when some of us claiming to push for change lost our way. The anguish of assassinations set off self-defeating riots. Legitimate grievances against police brutality tipped into excuse-making for criminal behavior. Racial politics could cut both ways, as the transformative message of unity and brotherhood was drowned out by the language of recrimination. And what had once been a call for equality of opportunity, the chance for all Americans to work hard and get ahead was too often framed as a mere desire for government support -- as if we had no agency in our own liberation, as if poverty was an excuse for not raising your child, and the bigotry of others was reason to give up on yourself.\par \par \uc2 All of that history is how progress stalled. That's how hope was diverted. It's how our country remained divided. But the good news is, just as was true in 1963, we now have a choice. We can continue down our current path, in which the gears of this great democracy grind to a halt and our children accept a life of lower expectations; where politics is a zero-sum game where a few do very well while struggling families of every race fight over a shrinking economic pie -- that's one path. Or we can have the courage to change.\par \par \uc2 The March on Washington teaches us that we are not trapped by the mistakes of history; that we are masters of our fate. But it also teaches us that the promise of this nation will only be kept when we work together. We'll have to reignite the embers of empathy and fellow feeling, the coalition of conscience that found expression in this place 50 years ago.\par \par \uc2 And I believe that spirit is there, that truth force inside each of us. I see it when a white mother recognizes her own daughter in the face of a poor black child. I see it when the black youth thinks of his own grandfather in the dignified steps of an elderly white man. It's there when the native-born recognizing that striving spirit of the new immigrant; when the interracial couple connects the pain of a gay couple who are discriminated against and understands it as their own.\par \par \uc2 That's where courage comes from -- when we turn not from each other, or on each other, but towards one another, and we find that we do not walk alone. That's where courage comes from.\par \par \uc2 And with that courage, we can stand together for good jobs and just wages. With that courage, we can stand together for the right to health care in the richest nation on Earth for every person. With that courage, we can stand together for the right of every child, from the corners of Anacostia to the hills of Appalachia, to get an education that stirs the mind and captures the spirit, and prepares them for the world that awaits them.\par \par \uc2 With that courage, we can feed the hungry, and house the homeless, and transform bleak wastelands of poverty into fields of commerce and promise.\par \par \uc2 America, I know the road will be long, but I know we can get there. Yes, we will stumble, but I know we'll get back up. That's how a movement happens. That's how history bends. That's how when somebody is faint of heart, somebody else brings them along and says, come on, we're marching.\par \par \uc2 There's a reason why so many who marched that day, and in the days to come, were young -- for the young are unconstrained by habits of fear, unconstrained by the conventions of what is. They dared to dream differently, to imagine something better. And I am convinced that same imagination, the same hunger of purpose stirs in this generation.\par \par \uc2 We might not face the same dangers of 1963, but the fierce urgency of now remains. We may never duplicate the swelling crowds and dazzling procession of that day so long ago -- no one can match King's brilliance -- but the same flame that lit the heart of all who are willing to take a first step for justice, I know that flame remains.\par \par \uc2 That tireless teacher who gets to class early and stays late and dips into her own pocket to buy supplies because she believes that every child is her charge -- she's marching.\par \par \uc2 That successful businessman who doesn't have to but pays his workers a fair wage and then offers a shot to a man, maybe an ex-con who is down on his luck -- he's marching.\par \par \uc2 The mother who pours her love into her daughter so that she grows up with the confidence to walk through the same door as anybody's son -- she's marching.\par \par \uc2 The father who realizes the most important job he'll ever have is raising his boy right, even if he didn't have a father -- especially if he didn't have a father at home -- he's marching.\par \par \uc2 The battle-scarred veterans who devote themselves not only to helping their fellow warriors stand again, and walk again, and run again, but to keep serving their country when they come home -- they are marching.\par \par \uc2 Everyone who realizes what those glorious patriots knew on that day -- that change does not come from Washington, but to Washington; that change has always been built on our willingness, We the people, to take on the mantle of citizenship -- you are marching\par \par \uc2 And that's the lesson of our past. That's the promise of tomorrow -- that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it. That when millions of Americans of every race and every region, every faith and every station, can join together in a spirit of brotherhood, then those mountains will be made low, and those rough places will be made plain, and those crooked places, they straighten out towards grace, and we will vindicate the faith of those who sacrificed so much and live up to the true meaning of our creed, as one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130828e98s00252\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Garden City Telegram, Aug. 17\par \par \uc2 Lost votes\par \par \uc2 Assault on voter rights has no place in democracy.\par \par \uc2 A lawsuit targeting Kansas' proof-of-citizenship voter registration requirement was to be expected.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  recently notified Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach that it would file a federal lawsuit unless the state stops enforcing a requirement for new voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU claims the new Kansas requirement doesn't comply with federal election laws. A \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  decision recently overturned key parts of Arizona's proof-of-citizenship law, which suggests Kansas' law also is on shaky ground.\par \par \uc2 The policy coveted by Kobach and fellow GOP ultraconservatives went into effect on Jan. 1. Now, new voters aren't legally registered until they've presented a birth certificate, passport or other document demonstrating citizenship.\par \par \uc2 But thanks to the proof-of-citizenship law, voter registration was left in "suspense" for nearly 15,000 Kansans. The mess has the state claiming prospective voters didn't provide a document necessary to satisfy the requirement, while evidence shows some did indeed show proof of citizenship at a driver's license office or had voted in the past.\par \par \uc2 Kobach -- a key player in a national anti-immigrant movement who pursues policies that disproportionately disenfranchise minorities -- says such requirements are needed because we've fallen prey to widespread voter fraud. But in a state with about 1.7 million registered voters, only a handful of cases related to reports of non-citizens voting or attempting to vote have materialized in the past decade, with even fewer convictions.\par \par \uc2 The proof-of-citizenship requirement in Kansas followed a law requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls, another ultraconservative strategy to discourage voting by sidelining those who may not have appropriate photo ID -- the poor, elderly and students, for example -- and who tend to favor Democrats on the ballot.\par \par \uc2 As if making it more difficult to vote isn't troubling enough, the thousands of prospective voters on the new "suspense" list easily could be the difference in tight statewide races -- sad proof that the strategy to suppress future votes is gaining momentum in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 And now, we're left to hope the threat of litigation somehow slows the deliberate, relentless assault on the democratic process.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Hutchinson News, Aug. 16\par \par \uc2 Huelskamp factor\par \par \uc2 One thing is certain: When voters in Kansas' Big First District go to the polls next year to vote for a representative in the U.S. House, they'll know exactly who they're voting for if their choice is Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a Republican.\par \par \uc2 The twice elected rep makes no bones about his defiance of current House leadership and his so-called mission to fight for American values.\par \par \uc2 "Kansans didn't send me to Washington to go-along-to-get-along," Huelskamp stated in a press release shortly after the publication this week of a McClatchy News Service story that featured the Kansas representative.\par \par \uc2 Huelskamp offers no apology for taking the word "compromise" out of his dictionary. He wants to march to his drummer and wants others to follow.\par \par \uc2 There were some signs that Huelskamp, a former state senator, would buck the system in Washington if elected. And since arriving in D.C. he has bucked the system, rocked the boat and irritated longtime Republican conservatives, specifically Speaker of the House \uc2 John Boehner\uc2 , who booted Huelskamp off the ag committee.\par \par \uc2 Many thought the loss of that committee assignment - a member of the Kansas delegation had served on that panel for nearly 100 years - would hurt a farm state like Kansas. Huelskamp also riled Kansans when he didn't support wind energy tax credits or funds for the National Bio- and Agro- Disease Facility in Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 He has used his fights with the GOP right to his advantage and loves calling himself a Washington outsider. He has marshaled tea party forces and become their leader.\par \par \uc2 Despite what one thinks about Huelskamp and his politics, you have to credit the representative for maintaining a consistent stance from the moment he was elected. There are no winds of change blowing through Huelskamp's D.C. office. Kansans might not like the fact that voters sent Huelskamp to D.C., but he has remained true to himself and the conservative values he espouses.\par \par \uc2 He is a rebel with a singular cause - representing American values - and rubs shoulders with equally rebellious House members. They are "unafraid, even eager, to defy their party's positions on everything from the Farm Bill to the budget," according to the McClatchy story.\par \par \uc2 And that would be good if the group actually accomplished more than defiance. But it hasn't.\par \par \uc2 It is too wrapped up in making sure it doesn't compromise - even with members of its own party - that it fails to accomplish anything relevant.\par \par \uc2 Rebellion for the sake of positive change is rebellion most can accept. But Huelskamp and his minions aren't changing a thing. They will have to compromise in order to effect change.\par \par \uc2 Huelskamp needs to understand that not everyone agrees with him and he is not always right. He has more opinions than facts - just like most politicians, who need to fashion those opinions into good legislation.\par \par \uc2 Not everyone agrees with Obama, either. The two and other party leaders need to find their way to the middle.\par \par \uc2 But Huelskamp likes to attach himself to the word uncompromising. He is not likely to change.\par \par \uc2 So voters will know exactly what they're getting if they re-elect Huelskamp next years. They can have Kansas be part of a do-nothing Congress or they can find a representative who multitasks - one who focuses on American values while effecting change that matters.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Topeka Capital-Journal, Aug. 16\par \par \uc2 Sex offender-teachers shouldn't get free ride\par \par \uc2 The Kansas State Board of Education on Tuesday lifted the teaching licenses of four people convicted of sex crimes against students.\par \par \uc2 The teachers, three men and one woman, will never see the inside of a Kansas classroom again. Others who are inclined to prey upon children will, however. It's difficult to identify sex offenders among beginning teachers.\par \par \uc2 Identifying teachers who have a history of preying on students should be easier, but that's not always the case.\par \par \uc2 School districts in Kansas and elsewhere have the ability to change that, and they should.\par \par \uc2 During the recent Kansas State Board of Education meeting, board member Carolyn Campbell said she was aware of cases in which school districts had allowed teachers to resign. The teachers later got jobs in Topeka and offended again.\par \par \uc2 Board member \uc2 Ken Willard\uc2  also noted some district attorneys were not reporting all felony convictions to the \uc2 Kansas Department of Education\uc2 , as required by law, so they can be checked against employment rosters. In Kansas, all felons are prohibited from teaching unless granted a waiver.\par \par \uc2 District attorneys should comply with the law, even though there is no penalty for noncompliance. But when it comes to keeping sex offenders out of the classrooms, school districts can take matters into their own hands.\par \par \uc2 All they really have to do is end the disgusting practice of letting some offenders resign to avoid prosecution. Allowing someone to resign -- apparently with the consent of the victim and parents -- can save a district some embarrassment but the result is a teacher is sent away without a criminal record and is free to go to another school and prey on children there.\par \par \uc2 It is unconscionable that people in positions of authority would allow that to happen.\par \par \uc2 If all sex offenses against students resulted in prosecution, school districts across the county could share information about their own teachers and other employees convicted of sex offenses, creating a central database that could be checked against employees and job applicants. Even if court records of an offender's conviction somehow failed to follow him or her to another state once released from prison, the database would prevent the offender from getting a teaching job.\par \par \uc2 Personnel rules often limit the amount of information about teachers that a district can release to the public. There are no such limits on court records. They are subject to the Kansas Open Records Act -- and similar laws in other states -- and can be publicly shared.\par \par \uc2 School districts everywhere must ensure sex offenders are prosecuted, then share all conviction records.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Wichita Eagle, Aug. 15\par \par \uc2 Remove voting barriers\par \par \uc2 Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach is protecting the integrity of our state's voting system from the likes of Heather Mohr. How reassuring. And ridiculous.\par \par \uc2 Mohr, an occupational therapist and a mother of four children, is one of about 3,000 Sedgwick County residents who registered to vote using the proper federal procedure but whose registrations were suspended until they provide proof of citizenship. Statewide, nearly 14,000 Kansans are "in suspense."\par \par \uc2 The Eagle interviewed several of these local residents. None was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . None was a threat to democracy. Yet all have to jump through more hoops to exercise their constitutional right to vote.\par \par \uc2 Kobach pushed the proof-of-citizenship requirement, which went into effect Jan. 1, as part of his campaign against voter fraud. But there is no evidence that voter fraud is a major problem, and even less evidence that illegal immigrants are voting.\par \par \uc2 According to records from before Kobach took office in 2011, there had been only seven cases of alleged fraud referred to local, state or federal authorities in five years, and only one of those cases was prosecuted. One case.\par \par \uc2 So to prevent a virtually nonexistent problem, the state added barriers that are blocking thousands of citizens. To add to the insult, Kobach, who has argued that even one case of voter fraud is too many, dismissed the number of suspended voters as insignificant.\par \par \uc2 "This is a pretty tiny percentage of 1.8 million voters," he said. "It's a small number of people."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  notified Kobach this week that it intends to file a federal lawsuit over the proof-of-citizenship requirement. Attorney General Derek Schmidt should also speak out against the law.\par \par \uc2 Several of the suspended voters questioned the motive of the law - whether the real purpose was to discourage certain types of people from voting, particularly the poor. That's an understandable suspicion, as GOP-controlled legislatures in several states have passed voting restrictions over the strong protests of groups such as the \uc2 NAACP\uc2  and the \uc2 League of Women Voters\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 North Carolina's governor signed a law Monday that requires a government-issued photo ID to vote, shortens early voting periods (despite long lines during last November's election), and eliminates a civics program that registers students in advance of their 18th birthdays.\par \par \uc2 The Rev. William Barber, president of North Carolina's \uc2 NAACP\uc2 , said that a large number of African-Americans, Latinos and students have come into the electorate, and the only way for state GOP leaders to stop this trend "is to try to put up barricades."\par \par \uc2 What's most frustrating about Kansas' proof-of-citizenship barricade is that the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  already ruled against such a restriction. Yet Kansas keeps blocking people like Heather Mohr.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 14,000 so far. And counting.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130820e98k000ws\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

ROBERTSON   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 859 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 August 2013\par 18:12\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2013.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - A drug-testing requirement for some welfare applicants and less restrictive demands on employers checking on workers who may be in the country illegally were the first two bills Thursday that \uc2 Pat McCrory\uc2  vetoed as North Carolina's governor.\par \par \uc2 The Republican governor said some of the drug-testing bill demands were fiscally irresponsible, potentially intrusive and punitive in restricting future access to benefits that could hurt families.\par \par \uc2 "This administration believes there are better ways to fight addiction and prevent criminal drug abuse," McCrory wrote in his formal veto message to legislators. "However, this is not the best way forward and I must veto this bill."\par \par \uc2 The other measure would have exempted employers from using the federal E-Verify system for temporary workers of less than nine months in a calendar year, compared to no more than three months in a 12-month period that is currently law. The bill, designed in part to help farmers who need seasonal labor, would make it easier to hire immigrants who are in the country illegally in more industries than just agriculture, McCrory said.\par \par \uc2 "Every job an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  takes is one less job available for a legal North Carolina citizen," McCrory said in a prepared statement. "We must do everything we can to help protect jobs for North Carolinians first and foremost."\par \par \uc2 The governor is now required to call the General Assembly back to Raleigh by early September so lawmakers can attempt to override his vetoes. Both measures passed the House and Senate in the legislative session's final days last month by wide veto-proof margins. A veto override requires yes votes from three-fifths of the members present in each chamber.\par \par \uc2 McCrory did issue an separate executive order dated Wednesday that attempts to address a portion of the drug-testing bill that would have subjected welfare and food stamp applicants to expanded background criminal history checks. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that county social services offices conduct criminal checks for first-time or renewing applicants.\par \par \uc2 McCrory, who took office in January, said the executive order reflects his support for "efforts to ensure that fugitive felons are not on public assistance rolls."\par \par \uc2 The bills would have to first be considered by the House, where Speaker Thom Tillis, R-Mecklenburg, expressed displeasure with the vetoes.\par \par \uc2 Tillis said in a statement that while the executive order "shows agreement on important aspects of the bill, I will consult with members of the House and Senate on the questions that remain as we move forward." Tillis said the immigration bill, which largely is comprised of a wide-ranging study on immigration matters, "received strong bipartisan support and sought to provide clarity to employers and agencies regarding the impact of illegal immigration in North Carolina."\par \par \uc2 The governor's office pointed out legislators provided no funds for the Department of Public Safety to carry out the study.\par \par \uc2 North Carolina Farm Bureau backed the E-Verify change in part because the 90-day exemption doesn't meet the needs of diversified farms and greenhouse and turf operations. All North Carolina employers with at least 25 workers must use the system to check new hires.\par \par \uc2 "We had hoped that Gov. McCrory would have allowed the legislation to become law," bureau President Larry Wooten said in a release.\par \par \uc2 The welfare bill would have directed state \uc2 HHS\uc2  to administer a drug test to any applicant to or recipient of the Work First welfare program who the agency "reasonably suspects is engaged in the illegal use of controlled substances." A person who tests positive for drugs would have to pay for any substance abuse program or drug retest should they want to reapply for benefits soon.\par \par \uc2 The current law already requires local social service agencies to screen for substance abusers and potentially help with treatment, but no drug testing is required. Supporters of the bill said people with drug problems shouldn't be getting money from the state they could use to buy drugs instead of food and clothing for their families.\par \par \uc2 McCrory's office said drug testing in welfare programs in Utah, Arizona and elsewhere "proved to be expensive and ineffective at catching drug abusers."\par \par \uc2 McCrory now has 35 bills on his desk that he must decide by Aug. 25 whether to sign, veto or let become law without his signature. He has already signed several high-profile bills since the legislature adjourned three weeks ago, including tougher rules on abortion, loosened regulations on carrying concealed weapons and a wide-ranging election overhaul measure that requires photo identification to vote in person.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  of North Carolina, which helped sue McCrory this week to challenge the new elections law, praised the governor Thursday for his veto of the drug-testing bill.\par \par \uc2 The measure "would have opened the door to costly and unnecessary government intrusions into the physical privacy of North Carolinians who need public assistance to care for their families," said state ACLU executive director \uc2 Jennifer Rudinger\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130815e98f001ka\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Kansas City Star, Aug. 11\par \par \uc2 Basic services take a hit in economic border war\par \par \uc2 Here's one more reason Kansas and Missouri lawmakers need to stop handing out excessive taxpayer incentives to entice companies to hop from one side of the state line to the other.\par \par \uc2 This costly border war -- which has produced few net new jobs in the metro area -- also has pushed local cities to pile on and give millions more in public subsidies to selected businesses. Those decisions often have reduced future revenues the cities and other taxing jurisdictions could and should receive from the companies.\par \par \uc2 One prime example: Kansas City decided to pour in more than $30 million in tax breaks to woo Freightquote's headquarters from Lenexa, adding to Missouri's already ample incentives. The \uc2 Center School District\uc2  and other jurisdictions won't get the millions in higher property taxes they should have had coming from the building.\par \par \uc2 Elected officials in both states recently have indicated a willingness to resolve the border war. To help cities and other entities provide better public services, the end needs to come post-haste.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The St. Joseph News-Press, Aug. 10\par \par \uc2 Immigration impacts all of us\par \par \uc2 At least we're talking about it.\par \par \uc2 This must be the shared opinion of many residents of the Midland Empire who recognize a dysfunctional immigration policy is no policy at all. We join in appealing for the kind of bipartisan solution that is needed, and by a number of accounts is within reach.\par \par \uc2 In this non-election year, the volume of the political rhetoric has been cranked down a few notches to allow thoughtful debate on immigration. The issue affects Americans on a daily basis, and more than most of us probably have thought about it.\par \par \uc2 Much of our food supply, including fresh produce and processed meat, passes through the hands of immigrants to the United States. Sectors of our economy such as health care, technology and service industries include large numbers of immigrant workers, at both entry-level positions and those requiring advanced skills.\par \par \uc2 At times, as with the arrival of our large pork-processing plant, the communities of Northeast Kansas and Northwest Missouri have debated these issues. Public resources have been strained by increased demands. At the same time, new businesses have opened, the labor pool has expanded and new neighbors have shared with us new customs.\par \par \uc2 Immigration has brought changes -- both positive and negative -- to the region. For the most part, we have adapted and we're moving forward. In this case, the American people are leaps and bounds ahead of our elected officials.\par \par \uc2 Our divided Congress so far has come up short in reforming laws that, right or wrong, simply don't fit the state of the world today. A global economy connects us with people all over the world. It's time for policies to match the reality.\par \par \uc2 Business interests and advocacy groups are giving voice to some commonsense ideas to reform policies to reflect needs along the border and in places like our region that may be far from the border but close to immigration. A key issue is what to do with the 11 million people in the country illegally, short of deporting everyone.\par \par \uc2 In recent days, one idea gaining traction in Congress would extend to illegal immigrants a grant of provisional legal status, comparable to the probationary legal status that is a part of current law. Once moved into this category, eligible immigrants could follow existing law and apply for permanent legal residency and pursue citizenship if they met strict standards.\par \par \uc2 As proposed, no currently \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  would be granted provisional legal status until stronger border protections and tighter enforcement of immigration laws were in place.\par \par \uc2 Such a comprehensive approach to reform is needed. We encourage our leaders to take action this year before next year's election cycle adds heat to the debate. We're talking about it, now let's take action.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Southeast Missourian, Aug. 9\par \par \uc2 Limbaugh's 25th\par \par \uc2 You won't find many people ambivalent about \uc2 Rush Limbaugh\uc2 . The conservative talk radio show host has a strong following of listeners who tune in for three hours Monday through Friday to hear the Cape Girardeau native address the issues of the day with his straightforward and unabashed opinion.\par \par \uc2 On Aug. 1 Limbaugh celebrated the silver anniversary of his nationally syndicated show.\par \par \uc2 Limbaugh got his start in radio as a youngster in Cape Girardeau working as a disc jockey on KGMO. Today's listeners and critics know him as the conservative talker not shy about offering his opinion, but Limbaugh's story is interesting.\par \par \uc2 Limbaugh has been fired seven times. Beyond radio, other career stops include a stint working in sales for the \uc2 Kansas City Royals\uc2 . But with a passion for the spoken word, Limbaugh eventually developed a hit show in Sacramento, Calif. The start of his nationally syndicated show on Aug. 1, 1988, was the next step, and now his listenership is about 20 million.\par \par \uc2 At times Limbaugh's comments go overboard -- something he's previously admitted. He is at his best when championing a conservative message with clarity and humor -- which he does regularly. In addition to being an entertainer, Limbaugh is a great communicator. He has the ability to sell a free market-vision that makes sense to many people.\par \par \uc2 While political talk radio has grown over the years, few have come close to Limbaugh's acclaim. His show rarely includes guests and only a few callers, yet he's able to command the attention of many. The Limbaugh Letter, a monthly publication, showcases his excellent interviewing skills.\par \par \uc2 There are things Limbaugh has said that we do not agree with, and at times this is counterproductive. But it's fair to say most of us have said something we wish we could take back. The difference is that Limbaugh has a national voice.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of political opinion, \uc2 Rush Limbaugh\uc2 's story offers encouragement. His confidence and passion for what he does are key attributes. His perseverance has paid off. At this 25-year anniversary, that's the story to be told.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Springfield News-Leader, Aug. 7\par \par \uc2 Use tax deserves a look\par \par \uc2 So, when Greene County officials began talking about asking the public to approve a use tax, we know it was a difficult conversation.\par \par \uc2 This idea is worth discussing.\par \par \uc2 Voters have heard about the county's financial woes. They know that the only way for the county to keep its balance sheet in the black is to either cut services or get more money. No one is going to be shocked if the county holds its hand out.\par \par \uc2 As County Administrator Tim Smith said, "We're looking at a future that doesn't work.... We've got to do something."\par \par \uc2 There have been plenty of other ideas presented. Some have been worth considering, while others have been poorly devised. None of them has been easy.\par \par \uc2 This one, proposed by Smith, should get consideration. It does not unfairly affect the poor, keeps our basic tax base unchanged and could bring in significant money. At a quarter cent, it could raise a much-needed $3 million.\par \par \uc2 It would also respond to a recent tax loss and provide a way to collect taxes on Internet purchases, an issue yet to be resolved at the federal level.\par \par \uc2 A use tax would allow the county to collect taxes on online and catalog sales, but only if the purchase is from a business that has a bricks-and-mortar location in the state. That would not only include purchases from \uc2 J.C. Penney\uc2 , for example, it would affect local companies, such as Running Chics, that do all sales online.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Greene County and other cities and counties in the state could no longer collect taxes on some large, out-of-state purchases.\par \par \uc2 That move cost the county an estimated $880,000 a year, but did not hurt Springfield or other local governments that have a voter-approved use tax law, which levies a tax on the use of an item and not on the purchase. The county attempted to get a similar tax in 1996, when the city succeeded, but county voters turned it down.\par \par \uc2 Smith hopes to get the use tax question on the November ballot. Because November elections typically have a high turnout, it would give the largest number of voters an opportunity to express their opinion at the ballot box.\par \par \uc2 We're not ready to support a tax, but think county commissioners should start the difficult discussion now. They only have three weeks to decide in order to meet the ballot deadline -- and that might not be enough time.\par \par \uc2 The county's economic ship is leaking in deep financial waters. Working with the city to find ways to cut expenses and share the load is one important way to plug the leaks. A use tax may be a way to keep things afloat.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130813e98d0019v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Gov. Scott Walker's administration has fired a high-ranking state Department of Transportation executive after he posted comments on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  calling immigrants in the U.S. without legal permission criminals and likening them to Satan.\par \par \uc2 DOT spokesman Robert Miller said in an email statement to The Associated Press that Assistant Deputy Secretary Steven Krieser was no longer employed at the agency as of Thursday. He declined to elaborate. Krieser made $97,971 annually.\par \par \uc2 Krieser confirmed in emails to the AP on Friday that he wrote the comments and apologized for them.\par \par \uc2 "I am deeply sorry and remorseful for my hurtful comments. I sincerely apologize to all who took offense. I have learned from this humbling situation, and can ask only thay (sic) people can find it in their hearts to forgive me."\par \par \uc2 The remarks come as Republicans across the country are wrestling with immigration reform. Walker, a potential GOP presidential candidate in 2016, has said the United States must remake its "cumbersome" immigration system and it makes sense to permit immigrants already here without legal permission to pursue citizenship as part of the fix.\par \par \uc2 Walker spokesman Tom Evenson called Kreiser's comments "repugnant" in a statement.\par \par \uc2 "Governor Walker condemns his views, and they do not represent the governor or his administration in any way," the statement said.\par \par \uc2 Krieser's remarks were part of a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  discussion Thursday about a bumper sticker on sale at a Germantown gas station that read "\uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Hunting Permit ... No Bag Limit - Tagging Not Required."\par \par \uc2 Responding to a comment that Jesus would be considered a non-English-speaking foreigner if he appeared in the United States, Krieser commented that the sticker "is probably over the top." But he went on to call immigrants who have entered the country without permission criminals, saying they've crushed southern states' social safety nets and education systems and skewed the service and agricultural sectors against natural-born Americans.\par \par \uc2 " ... You may see Jesus when you look at them. I see Satan. And if they don't like it here, hey, the door they came through to get here swings both ways," Krieser wrote.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Josh Zepnick, D-Milwaukee, also took part in the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  discussion about the bumper sticker, writing that Jesus didn't preach violence or resentment toward the poor and gays. He said in a phone interview he couldn't believe what Krieser wrote.\par \par \uc2 "This guy didn't put just one or two sentences in," Zepnick said. "He went on a whole tirade."\par \par \uc2 Krieser made news in 2011 when he sent an email to Division of Motor Vehicles staff telling them to issue free identification cards only if customers asked for them. The free ID option is part of a Republican-authored law that requires voters to show photo identification at the polls. A Dane County judge has blocked the law from taking effect.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130809e989001ea\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate wrapped up its immigration debate with senators talking a lot about themselves and their immigrant families.\par \par \uc2 Leading the way were the eight senators -- four Democrats and four Republicans -- who spent hour after hour since January working out a compromise at some political peril. They had reason to reflect: Unlike most bipartisan gangs from Senates past, this one actually produced legislation that could help resolve one of the most complex and far-reaching policy conundrums facing the country.\par \par \uc2 "We cussed one another, we cheered one another, and we wrote a bill together," Sen. Dick Durbin D-Ill., said of negotiations.\par \par \uc2 Immigration policy is, by definition, personal to most Americans. Throughout the final day of debate Thursday, senators made clear it's certainly personal to them.\par \par \uc2 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., teared up when recalling his father-in-law, who was born in Russia.\par \par \uc2 Sens. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Durbin dedicated their votes to their mothers.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., recalled working as a child with his family, side-by-side with immigrants here illegally "who worked harder than we did under conditions much more difficult than we endured." Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., spoke of his grandparents and great-grandparents who fled persecution in Europe.\par \par \uc2 Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., relayed several news reports recounting the thousands of people whose bodies have been found in the sweltering Arizona desert, evidence of the risks that people take in illegally crossing the border from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "Isn't it in us to bring 11 million people out of the shadows?" McCain said on the Senate floor.\par \par \uc2 Yes, the Senate later agreed, voting 68-32 to send to the House a bill that would put most of them on a path toward citizenship and establish a military-style operation of 20,000 new guards, 700 miles of fencing and an array of war-developed technologies like drones and motion sensors to make the U.S.-Mexico border virtually impenetrable. The House is all for the latter, but majority Republicans are much less enamored with a creating a new path to citizenship for people breaking the law by their very presence in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers had for months shared stories and listened to testimony from immigrants about the horrors of hiding, the sorrow of families separated and the struggle to make it in America. But Thursday, in the moments before the vote and the lawmakers' scramble out of town for July 4th, senators paused to make the point that the legislation is personal for them too.\par \par \uc2 Menendez said he was thinking of his own family, especially his mother, who came from Cuba. "When the moment comes to cast that vote, I will be casting it in memory of" her, he said.\par \par \uc2 Flake recalled cutting and hauling hay alongside "undocumented migrant" laborers, mostly from Mexico. "Since that time, I have harbored a feeling of admiration and respect for those who have come to risk life and limb and sacrifice so much to provide a better life for themselves and their families."\par \par \uc2 Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who's contemplating a presidential run in 2016, told his parents' story of boarding a plane leaving Cuba in 1956 and struggling to find stable footing here. His mother wept when "her president," John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Well before they became citizens, in their hearts they had already become Americans," said Rubio, whose role in the legislation has ignited a backlash from the same tea partyers who once made him their hero.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., spoke of his late parents when he addressed opponents of the bill who complain that immigrants are not well-educated.\par \par \uc2 "One of the critics of this bill, one of the organizations, said that the average \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has a 10th-grade education. Well, all I can tell you is you have got a United States senator who came from parents that didn't have (even) a 10th grade education. ... To those who say that among this \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population they are just not well-educated, you have no idea how offensive that is to a guy like me. So you can take your criticism -- and we'll just end it at that."\par \par \uc2 Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., spoke of his mother's family escaping the Holocaust in Poland, going through Sweden and Mexico City and finally reaching New York City in 1950. His mother was almost 12 years old and the only one in the family who could speak any English. On the senator's first birthday, his grandparents once wrote him a birthday card that started, "Mr. President."\par \par \uc2 "'The ancient Greeks gave us the world, the high ideals of democracy, in search of which your dear mother and we came to the hospitable shores of beautiful America in 1950," they wrote, according to Bennet. "We have been happy here ever since -- beyond our greatest dreams and expectations with democracy, freedom and love and humanity's greatest treasures. We hope that when you grow up, you will help to develop in other parts of the world a greater understanding of these American values.'"\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130627e96r002ek\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 YUMA, Ariz. (AP) - For drug smugglers and illegal immigrants traversing the wilderness\par \par \uc2 around Yuma during the summer months, "the desert is a dangerous\par \par \uc2 place," said Tyler Emblem, Senior Patrol Agent with the Yuma Sector\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) team.\par \par \uc2 "The trouble begins when people cross the border here. There are a lot\par \par \uc2 of things that can go wrong."\par \par \uc2 The first issue for illegal immigrants is getting enough water to drink\par \par \uc2 to stave off dehydration, which can be deadly in the scorching heat,\par \par \uc2 especially since there are no natural sources of water readily available in the desert.\par \par \uc2 "You can run out of water, and the water you do have when you cross soon becomes as hot as the air around\par \par \uc2 you - in excess of 100 degrees."\par \par \uc2 Most illegal immigrants cannot physically carry the water they need to survive over the course of the\par \par \uc2 several days it takes to reach their northerly destinations. Some illegal immigrants have even been known to\par \par \uc2 become desperate enough to drink their own urine before being rescued - if they are rescued in time.\par \par \uc2 Another problem is losing their way in the vast wide open desert, or being left behind by the coyotes guiding\par \par \uc2 the way.\par \par \uc2 "You can get blisters," Emblem said. "When you get blisters you don't want to walk and can be left behind.\par \par \uc2 The guides leave them for fear of being caught. They get stranded. They get lost. It is unlikely that someone is\par \par \uc2 going to carry their loved one or their buddy out of the desert when they become incapacitated."\par \par \uc2 At this point, the stranded persons know their only chance of survival is to be rescued. But communications\par \par \uc2 may not be at hand.\par \par \uc2 "If you have a cell phone and call for help, you have to have a signal," Emblem noted. "You have to hope your\par \par \uc2 battery doesn't go dead. Some people attempt to make signal fires, but it is hard to start fires in the desert\par \par \uc2 because there is not a lot of brush out there to begin with."\par \par \uc2 Any one of these issues "can lead to disaster for anyone attempting to cross the border here," Emblem\par \par \uc2 continued. "Although the Border Patrol does have well-trained people to carry out rescue missions and render\par \par \uc2 aid to those in distress - it is a very, very big desert. Prevention is without a doubt the best medicine."\par \par \uc2 To help persuade illegal immigrants not to attempt the treacherous journey in the first place, the Border\par \par \uc2 Patrol is publicizing their Border Safety Initiative, a bi-national effort with Mexico to reduce border deaths and\par \par \uc2 injuries along the international border.\par \par \uc2 As part of the initiative, Yuma Sector agents are focused on raising awareness among migrants about the\par \par \uc2 realities they may face including harsh environmental conditions, deadly temperatures, abuse by smugglers\par \par \uc2 and the potential penalties of being apprehended by the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 Part of the responsibility of Border Patrol agents "is to bring the problem to the people who may be\par \par \uc2 contemplating crossing the border illegally," explained Mario Villarreal, Yuma Sector Division Chief for\par \par \uc2 Operations.\par \par \uc2 "Certainly this time of the year it is absolutely not the time to try to cross into the United States. The\par \par \uc2 temperatures are extreme. It is extremely dangerous, and it is not worth your life to try and cross illegally into\par \par \uc2 the United States. Individuals who cross cannot carry enough water to walk five days."\par \par \uc2 While prevention is the key, there will still be drug smugglers and people crossing illegally brazen enough to attempt\par \par \uc2 the arduous journey - some of whom will face life threatening situations.\par \par \uc2 As of May 31, 2013, there have been 12 people rescued from the desert by Yuma Sector agents. Six others\par \par \uc2 were not located and died in the wilderness. There were also 3,380 illegal border-crossers detained.\par \par \uc2 Those numbers have fallen drastically since the peak year of 2005 when there were 486 people rescued, 53\par \par \uc2 deaths and 140,525 detained.\par \par \uc2 Yuma Sector agents "have done a great job in restoring this piece of the country to an area that is one of the\par \par \uc2 securest in the nation," Villarreal said.\par \par \uc2 "As a result, the people that are crossing illegally into the area, the number has reduced - thus the reduction in\par \par \uc2 rescues and migrant deaths. They go hand-in-hand."\par \par \uc2 But BORSTAR is ready for those who still come and find themselves stranded.\par \par \uc2 There are several ways the team becomes aware of those in the desert who need help. The first is through a\par \par \uc2 series of 24 Rescue Beacons strewn throughout the sector. Each beacon continuously flashes lights and has\par \par \uc2 a large push button and sensor activation which connects via radio to Border Patrol dispatch. An agent is then\par \par \uc2 sent to the activated beacon within an hour.\par \par \uc2 Other ways of finding those in distress is through emergency 911 calls, or by tracking footprints. Some agents\par \par \uc2 are able to determine if a person is injured just by examining the tracks they leave behind.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of how they become aware of an individual or group in distress, once BORSTAR learns of a\par \par \uc2 potentially life threatening situation, they immediately respond if available.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday morning, BORSTAR agents invited Yuma-area media outlets and dignitaries to a special rescue\par \par \uc2 exercise. It began with a long drive several miles southeast onto the Barry M. Goldwater Bombing Range, a\par \par \uc2 popular corridor for illegal border immigrants and drug smugglers.\par \par \uc2 After the city of Yuma had almost vanished over the horizon, two agents received a simulated report of a person in\par \par \uc2 distress who had called 911, and searched the area. They found a disturbance next to a dirt road indicating\par \par \uc2 someone had passed through the area, and called in a BORSTAR K9 unit because they would not be able to\par \par \uc2 easily follow the tracks in the rocky terrain of the Gila Mountains.\par \par \uc2 Once on scene, the working dog picked up the scent of the person who had passed by, and directed the\par \par \uc2 handler and the two agents through the open desert, across a wash and up the side of a mountain to a man\par \par \uc2 portraying a stranded \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Once the discovery was made, a BORSTAR medical unit was dispatched to render emergency services to\par \par \uc2 the man.\par \par \uc2 Upon arrival, the BORSTAR paramedics immediately began attempts to cool the man's core temperature and\par \par \uc2 to rehydrate him with an intravenous drip. He was then loaded into a litter basket and carried to a waiting\par \par \uc2 Hummer to be transported to an area off the bombing range to be picked up by a medical helicopter. Nonmilitary aircraft are generally not allowed in military airspace if training is being conducted, as it was\par \par \uc2 Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Once in an area just northeast of the bombing range, a Tri-State helicopter landed and whisked the man away\par \par \uc2 to safety.\par \par \uc2 This was all just another day at the office for the agents, even though they had spent hours outside traversing\par \par \uc2 treacherous terrain in triple-digit temperatures.\par \par \uc2 The exercise "shows what Border Patrol agents deal with daily, and certainly what we deal with more often\par \par \uc2 than not," Emblem said.\par \par \uc2 "The Yuma desert is pretty wide open and pretty desolate and without a doubt is remote. It takes hours to even\par \par \uc2 just get to the area where we are going to affect our rescue. It adds up. The more time you spend in the heat, the\par \par \uc2 more of a toll it is going to take on you. A lot of body functions rely on proper hydration, and when you are\par \par \uc2 battling that every minute you are outside, it is certainly taxing. It doesn't let up."\par \par \uc2 Despite the constant battle with the environment, the BORSTAR team and the other agents in the Yuma\par \par \uc2 Sector have the training, commitment and expertise to succeed where others would fail, especially when lives\par \par \uc2 are on the line, Emblem concluded.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130623e96n002h2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday challenged his allies in the nation's largest nurses union to look beyond their own immediate concerns and help organize a movement to address global climate change.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic governor enjoyed an enthusiastic reception from a packed room of nurses wearing red shirts at the \uc2 National Nurses United\uc2  conference in San Francisco. The union was a strong supporter of Brown in his 2010 gubernatorial race and helped him win voter support for his initiative raising the state's sales and income taxes last year.\par \par \uc2 "You're a hell of a lot more radical, and forward and progressive than I am," the governor said. "I can't push you. You got to push me, but together we'll push our country to a much better place."\par \par \uc2 Brown referred to recent data that show carbon dioxide was measured at 400 parts per million at the oldest monitoring station in Hawaii, which sets the global benchmark. The last time the worldwide carbon level was probably that high was about 2 million years ago, some researchers estimate.\par \par \uc2 "The last time that happened ... sea level was 60 foot higher, in other words, we'd be under water right now," Brown said. "The scientific consensus is, we need to take action."\par \par \uc2 Brown said the nurses should use their organizing might to tell the public that the survival of future generations is at risk.\par \par \uc2 He said focusing on climate change also could help the union remain relevant, as labor union membership erodes each year.\par \par \uc2 "If the American labor movement wants to grow instead of shrinking every year, the only way it's going to get there is organizing with not just the immediate, but with the largest sense of what we have to do as men and women of this country," Brown said.\par \par \uc2 The nurses were later joining a rally at the Golden Gate Bridge opposing the contentious Keystone XL Pipeline.\par \par \uc2 The union was instrumental to getting Brown into his latest term as governor, staging animated rallies during his 2010 campaign in which people dressed as royalty mocked his wealthy Republican opponent, Meg Whitman.\par \par \uc2 It was later revealed that the union helped Whitman's former maid, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , go public with her story, helping sink Whitman's campaign.\par \par \uc2 "Of all the unions I'm talking to, nobody has a better global vision than nurses," Brown said to big applause. "If you can link your immediate occupational objectives with the larger sense of what we need to do as human beings, you become a very powerful organization."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Jason Dearen on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/JHDearen"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/JHDearen}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130620e96k002mu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The immigration debate in Arizona reached a boiling point in 2007 when the state passed a groundbreaking law targeting those often blamed with fueling the nation's border woes: Employers who hire immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 The law marked a bold step by a state into an area that had long been the domain of the federal government, and it paved the way for Arizona's landmark 2010 immigration law. It also represented a key moment in the immigration battles that continue today as Congress mulls a proposed overhaul of the immigration system.\par \par \uc2 But an examination of the law by The Associated Press found that it has done little to crack down on problematic employers. Only three of the state's 147,000 employers have been brought to civil court on illegal hiring allegations, while several hundred employees who are living in the U.S. illegally have been arrested under a section of the law that made it a felony to use fake or stolen IDs to get jobs.\par \par \uc2 While the law has been upheld by the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  and hailed as a tool for states to confront illegal immigration, it has faced several problems:\par \par \uc2 -- Hundreds of immigrant workers arrested under the law have spent months in jail on ID theft charges, while only two businesses -- a sandwich shop and now-defunct amusement park -- had their business licenses suspended for several days. The case against the third business, a custom furniture maker, is still pending.\par \par \uc2 -- A high legal standard for proving violations by businesses and a lack of subpoena power in getting employment records are almost insurmountable barriers to making cases against employers.\par \par \uc2 -- Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office is the only police agency in the state that has raided businesses in enforcement of the employment law. It has arrested hundreds of workers in 72 business raids since 2008. The office has since been accused by the \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2  of discriminating against Latino workers, allegations the sheriff denies.\par \par \uc2 -- Despite the small number of cases against employers, the county prosecutor's office in metropolitan Phoenix has spent $4.5 million since 2008 investigating businesses suspected of hiring workers who aren't in the country legally and to pursue criminal ID theft cases against employees. Nearly a third of the money -- $1.4 million -- was given by the prosecutor's office to Arpaio's agency to investigate such cases.\par \par \uc2 Backers contend the enforcement numbers tell only a piece of the story. They say the law has helped combat identity theft and prompted immigrants living in the country illegally to leave Arizona. They also believe that the fear of business raids has caused employers to follow the rules.\par \par \uc2 "We are never going to get 100 percent compliance, but we have made a difference," said former Arizona Senate President Russell Pearce, the driving force behind the employment law and the state's 2010 immigration law that requires police officers, while enforcing other laws, to question people's immigration status if they are suspected of being in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The number of immigrants living in Arizona without permission to be in the U.S. declined by 200,000 from 2008 to January 2011, when the total estimated number stood at 360,000, according to a \uc2 U.S. Department of Homeland Security\uc2  report. While the law's backers say the decrease shows the state's immigration laws are working, other factors contributed to immigrants leaving the state, such a construction industry that hemorrhaged jobs during that period.\par \par \uc2 Democratic state Sen. Steve Gallardo of Phoenix, an opponent of the law, said the imbalance in the number of cases against employers versus workers is a reflection of legislators who wanted to appear tough on illegal immigration but gave employers plenty of wiggle room.\par \par \uc2 "You have an employer sanctions law that doesn't go after the employers," Gallardo said. "We should call it the employee sanctions law."\par \par \uc2 More than 500 immigrants who weren't authorized to be in the country have been arrested on charges of using forged documents or stolen identities to get jobs at businesses raided by Arpaio's office since 2008. An unknown number of additional ID theft arrests were made by other police agencies, which don't raid businesses in enforcing the law but make cases when people complain that their identity has been stolen.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for immigrants accused of ID theft say their clients used fake or stolen identities to get jobs, not to rack up debt under another person's name. Their clients spend months in jail without the chance of getting a bond set, because a voter-approved law denies bail to people who aren't in the country legally and are charged with serious felonies, such as murder, sexual assault and aggravated identity theft.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants desperate to earn money to support their families often plead guilty to felony charges to get out of jail, walking away with time-served but often facing deportation and unable to ever again enter the U.S. legally, their lawyers said.\par \par \uc2 The law's backers say illegal immigrants who steal identities to get jobs are still committing a crime. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery, the top prosecutor for the state's most populous county, said identity theft victims may get a letter saying they owe back taxes for jobs they've never held, could have problems getting loans and face hassle in untangling the mess.\par \par \uc2 While most of the ID theft cases end in guilty pleas, one case that went to trial last year ended with an acquittal, even though the man from Costa Rica told jurors he used someone else's Social Security number to get a job.\par \par \uc2 Walter Flores-Garcia, a 47-year-old concrete company worker, told jurors that he didn't return to Costa Rica after he overstayed his visa because his daughter wouldn't get the same type of treatment for her cerebral palsy back home. He also told jurors he used someone else's information on work documents to get a job and had no intention to defraud the true Social Security number holder.\par \par \uc2 Jury forewoman Marilee Avina said jurors concluded Flores-Garcia wasn't leeching off others and took all possible steps to be legitimate. "One specific juror said, `This could have been me,'" Avina said.\par \par \uc2 The chief difficulty in making cases against employers is that it's not enough to prove a business hired an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . To prove a case, prosecutors say they need a confession from an owner or hiring manager, or a recording of an owner admitting to breaking the law -- all of which are difficult to come by.\par \par \uc2 Another barrier is the law doesn't give prosecutors civil subpoena power to make suspected violators hand over records while the case is being investigated.\par \par \uc2 Business owners say the law puts them in a tight spot. They note they aren't document experts, and insist they would open themselves up to civil rights lawsuits if they were to inquire too deeply into whether a prospective employee is in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 "It's not the employer's job to be the Border Patrol," said Marion "Mac" Magruder, an opponent of the law who runs a human resource business and grew so frustrated with Arpaio raids that he resigned as a volunteer in one of the sheriff's posses.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff stands by his raids and fake ID arrests, saying there's no rationalization for stealing a person's identity and that his officers aren't raiding businesses with the goal of seeing if workers are here illegally.\par \par \uc2 "I am going in there to lock these people up. They just happen to be here illegally. That doesn't change that they are violating the law with fake IDs," Arpaio said.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff said he's bothered that so few employers have been brought to court and called the law's penalties for employers weak. "I would love to catch the employers," Arpaio said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130517e95h00157\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Rhode Island lawmakers reviewed legislation Tuesday that would allow immigrants to obtain driver's licenses regardless of their legal status -- but the controversial idea has already run into opposition from law enforcement, anti-illegal immigration groups and the ACLU.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Frank Ciccone, D-Providence, told lawmakers evaluating his bill that since many illegal immigrants are already driving without licenses, it makes sense to subject them to licensing rules like other drivers. He said it would help law enforcement and possibly increase highway safety.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of these people are hardworking, dedicated individuals," Ciccone said. "This would tighten up the identification rules of people that need to be identified."\par \par \uc2 But the bill faces opposition from the Rhode Island State Police, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, anti-illegal immigration advocates and the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  -- and even Ciccone said it may need to be refashioned before it's ready for a vote.\par \par \uc2 Ciccone's proposal would direct the state's Division of Motor Vehicles to provide special licenses to immigrants at a cost of $100. The applicant would have to submit proof of Rhode Island residency and insurance to acquire a license, which would expire in two years.\par \par \uc2 Applicants would also have to submit their fingerprints and consent to a criminal background check.\par \par \uc2 Opponents argue that giving licenses to illegal immigrants would reward law-breaking and prompt more people to move to Rhode Island without following proper immigration rules, according to Terry Gorham, leader of the Rhode Islanders For Immigration Law Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "We don't think benefits should be given to illegal immigrants, period," he told The Associated Press. "You can get a job here as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Health care, education, and now we're going to give you a license?"\par \par \uc2 He wasn't the only one to testify against the bill. A spokesman for the state police told lawmakers that background and fingerprint checks won't turn up much information on illegal immigrants, and that the new licenses could run afoul of federal rules on government identification. And Joee Lindbeck, Kilmartin's legislative director, cautioned that the way the bill is written, immigrants could obtain a license without showing they know how to drive. Lindbeck also said that the bill could lead to cases of identity theft if individuals use someone else's name to acquire a license.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the ACLU opposes the bill because it would also require many legal immigrants -- who have legal status in the United States but are not citizens -- to obtain the same kind of license as those in the country illegally. Right now, many of those individuals are eligible for standard licenses.\par \par \uc2 At least a dozen states are considering other proposals to allow illegal immigrants to obtain licenses. New Mexico, Utah, Illinois, Maryland, Oregon and Washington currently allow driver's licenses for those illegally in the country.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130507e9570023a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MEXICO CITY (AP) - The Mexican navy said Monday it has detected a disturbing trend of migrant smugglers abandoning boatloads of people at sea off the coast of Baja California.\par \par \uc2 The Navy said that each month it has been finding an average of 10 to 12 boats, with a total of about out 150 migrants. It did not say when the discoveries began, or why the smugglers might have adopted the tactic. However, smugglers sometimes demand payment for such trips up front, leaving them little incentive to get passengers all the way to the United States.\par \par \uc2 The Navy said the boats' captains abandoned the vessels aboard other craft, telling migrants the motors or other equipment had broken down and they would be back.\par \par \uc2 The smugglers then left the migrants adrift, often in overcrowded boats without food or radios, putting their lives at risk.\par \par \uc2 A video released by the navy shows sailors approaching several vessels, some in choppy waters, to rescue ragged-looking passengers.\par \par \uc2 "This could lead to a lamentable loss of human life," the navy said.\par \par \uc2 As the United States tightens security across land borders with Mexico, smugglers are increasingly turning to the California coast to bring people and drugs to the United States from Mexico\par \par \uc2 The number of Border Patrol agents on land has doubled in the past eight years, and hundreds of miles (kilometers) of fences and other barriers have been erected, driving smugglers to the Pacific Ocean.\par \par \uc2 U.S. authorities spotted 210 suspected smuggling vessels along California shores during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, up 15 percent from 183 incidents the previous year and more than quadruple the 45 incidents in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Migrants pay thousands of dollars to launch from beaches and small fishing villages south of Tijuana, Mexico. They typically use old, single-engine wooden fishing skiffs known as pangas.\par \par \uc2 In October, a Mexican woman told authorities she agreed to pay $12,000 to be smuggled by boat into the U.S. A criminal complaint says she was among 16 people -- all but one a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico -- found in a 31-foot vessel that appeared to be taking in water in the Newport Beach harbor.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130429e94t001xa\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A sampling of recent editorials from Colorado newspapers:\par \par \uc2 NATIONAL:\par \par \uc2 The Denver Post, April 16, on the bombings at the Boston Marathon:\par \par \uc2 You can hardly imagine a more innocent public venue than a marathon, where most participants run solely for the love of the sport after devoting untold hours to building their endurance and strength.\par \par \uc2 So naturally you can hardly imagine a more vicious blow to our collective sense of peace and security than the sort of terror attack that rocked the nation Monday in Boston.\par \par \uc2 We write this while the details of the bombings are only beginning to be confirmed, and with no knowledge of whom the perpetrator might be. But whatever the particulars of his grievance, his broader purpose -- to harm as many innocent people as possible while sowing fear in everyone else -- is unmistakable.\par \par \uc2 And as often is the case when someone without scruples seeks such ugly ends, he has been too tragically successful in his quest.\par \par \uc2 Here in sports-happy Colorado, we boast of the Bolder Boulder in running, the USA Pro Challenge in cycling, and a variety of other high-profile events. What precautions and inconveniences will the organizers of those competitions now feel obliged to impose on those who participate or attend -- and to what actual usefulness?\par \par \uc2 We can only echo the sentiments of the Bolder Boulder website, which by mid-afternoon Monday had posted a note saying, "Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Boston, the Boston running community and the Boston Marathon family."\par \par \uc2 We can't reflect on the despicable attack on innocent people in Boston without at least some reference to our own community's horror last year at an Aurora theater -- another venue of seeming innocence turned into a living hell. And yet as raw as the scars from that massacre remain, it's worth noting that Americans haven't been intimidated from going to movies as a result, any more than they will cease participating in the sports they love because of what happened Monday.\par \par \uc2 Such attacks may shock us to the core because of their mindless cruelty, but our society -- resilient and fundamentally stable -- ultimately shakes them off and moves on.\par \par \uc2 In terms of style and venue, Monday's attack seems to have more similarities to the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta, which killed one person (another died of a heart attack) and injured more than 100.\par \par \uc2 The terrorist behind that assault, Eric Rudolph, would unfortunately go on to set other bombs elsewhere and hurt other innocent people before being corraled and arrested finally in 2003.\par \par \uc2 Let us hope for a far quicker resolution to the crime in Boston. And let us also hope that the injured survivors of the attack are able to heal in time, too -- in body to the extent possible, of course, but also in spirit.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci--23031267/vicious-act-terror-boston"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci--23031267/vicious-act-terror-boston}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Daily Sentinel, April 10, on a case demanding a reporter covering the Aurora theater shootings reveal her sources:\par \par \uc2 Jana Winter, a reporter for FoxNews.com, wasn't ordered to reveal her confidential sources during an Arapahoe County District Court hearing Wednesday. But the fact that Judge Carlos Samour Jr. didn't dismiss the case outright is troubling for anyone concerned about the First Amendment.\par \par \uc2 Winter was one of many journalists covering the aftermath of the Aurora theater shootings last July, in which a dozen people were killed and 58 injured. She scored a coup when she learned from confidential sources that accused murderer James Holmes had mailed a notebook detailing his plans to kill people and crude drawings of murders to his \uc2 University of Colorado\uc2  psychiatrist shortly before the attack.\par \par \uc2 Holmes' defense attorneys have demanded that Winter reveal her sources because, they say, those sources violated a gag order issued by the judge who was then in charge of the case.\par \par \uc2 But that isn't sufficient grounds to demand that Winter identify her sources. Her work is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution and Colorado's Shield Law. Shield laws have been passed in 40 states because confidential sources can be critical in helping journalists obtain information -- and report it to the public -- that influential people want kept secret. Watergate is the most famous example.\par \par \uc2 A possible gag-order violation by others is no reason to punish Winter by sending her to jail for contempt of court, as she has said she is willing to do rather than identify her sources.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, it is not clear whether Holmes' notebook can be used in his court case or that it wouldn't have come out in the official record even without Winter's reporting.\par \par \uc2 There is no justification for pursuing the case against Winter and further impinging on the First Amendment. Judge Samour should dismiss the case against her.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.gjsentinel.com/S7ed8ec4dbe27d10af16fa66327a3e76b2a34456e/opinion/articles/1st-amendment-in-court/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.gjsentinel.com/S7ed8ec4dbe27d10af16fa66327a3e76b2a34456e/opinion/articles/1st-amendment-in-court/}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 STATE:\par \par \uc2 Longmont Times-Call, April 14, on why Colorado needs to address holes in its parole system:\par \par \uc2 Reports that Evan Ebel, accused of killing Colorado prisons chief Tom Clements and pizza delivery driver Nathan Leon, was allowed out of prison too early and removed his monitoring device with no prompt follow-up response from authorities should trouble Coloradans.\par \par \uc2 But even more disturbing, the beginning of a study requested by Gov. John Hickenlooper to determine if the problems in Ebel's case were isolated shows Ebel was not the only prisoner whose sentence could have been shortened due to clerical error.\par \par \uc2 Fremont County officials said Tuesday they had found similar sentencing errors in the files of two current inmates.\par \par \uc2 While in prison, Ebel pleaded guilty to assaulting a guard and was sentenced to an additional four years in prison. But the oversight allowed him to serve that time at the same time as his previous sentence instead of in sequence, and he was released in January.\par \par \uc2 Ebel took off his electronic monitoring ankle bracelet on March 14, but authorities didn't issue a warrant for that parole violation for six days -- a day after he is accused of killing Clements and three days after Leon was killed.\par \par \uc2 After learning about the sentencing error, Hickenlooper asked the \uc2 Department of Corrections\uc2  to review cases going back 10 years. That review is clearly needed, but a change in procedures also needs to take place so future mistakes aren't made. Currently, the \uc2 Department of Corrections\uc2  automatically calculates sentences to serve concurrently unless the sentencing order stipulates consecutive sentences. In Ebel's case, the judge did not mention at sentencing for the guard assault that the sentences were to be consecutive, so the clerk did not put it on the paperwork. The court system needs to find a way to ensure that the judge and clerk give the prison system proper direction in every case.\par \par \uc2 The National Institute of Corrections has been asked to review state parole procedures.\par \par \uc2 Already, Colorado's parole director has issued new guidelines for parole officers to follow whenever a monitoring bracelet alert is detected. A parole officer is required to respond within two hours, and to issue a warrant within a day if a parole escapes supervision.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Department of Corrections\uc2  has said it will allocate $495,387 from its current budget to meet the new guidelines. State lawmakers are expected to consider extra funding in the 2013-14 budget to help the agency do the increased supervision.\par \par \uc2 The efforts under way should help prevent future problems. But the state, and especially its legal system and lawmakers, should remain ever vigilant that prisoners serve their full sentences and parolees receive adequate supervision as they transition back into society.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.timescall.com/opinion/ci--23013938/state-must-patch-holes-parole-system"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.timescall.com/opinion/ci--23013938/state-must-patch-holes-parole-system}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Aurora Sentinel, April 12, on a bill that would repeal a 2006 law requiring police to report people they suspect are illegal immigrants:\par \par \uc2 If good sense can't prevail in the federal issue of illegal immigration, at least common sense here in Colorado will keep bad political decisions at bay.\par \par \uc2 Colorado is waiting for Gov. John Hickenlooper to sign a state bill passed last week that will repeal a 2006 law requiring police to report people they suspect are illegal immigrants. It was an illogical and bad political move that really never saw enforcement.\par \par \uc2 This week, state lawmakers are taking up a measure that would issue a type of driver's license to international "visitors" to help ensure they have real driving skills and real auto insurance.\par \par \uc2 Police in Aurora have worked hard to ensure that the city's large \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  community understands that police are here to uphold the law and help everyone, no matter what their residency status is. They realized that having state officials make police de facto immigration officers would push a new class of crime victims into the dark and create a dangerous situation for all of Colorado.\par \par \uc2 If the outgoing law were actually implemented, illegal and even legal Hispanic immigrants would avoid police at all costs if cops are a hot line to Immigration and Customs Enforcement squads -- meaning they won't call the cops when they know about a crime or even if they're victims of a crime. It won't take long before criminals figure this out and start targeting Hispanics for robberies and rapes, knowing that most won't dare to call police for fear of being deported. But just as important, immigrants will start living underground lives, minimizing their contact with the rest of the community. An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  involved in even a minor traffic accident would likely run from the scene, rather than take a chance of being deported.\par \par \uc2 Despite that logic, Colorado joined the so-called Secure Communities program, alerting police to the likelihood of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . In reality, it almost never happened.\par \par \uc2 The database itself is run by the federal government, but it's far from being a national, comprehensive pool of information. There is no national service that allows police, or anyone, to test nationality. Instead, there are myriad centralized records that contain some information about some U.S. citizens. There are passport records, driver's license records, tax records, Social Security records and more. But almost all of those are off-limits to even the cops.\par \par \uc2 State and federal lawmakers have gone to great lengths to ensure that there is no centralized identification system in the United States, fearing "Big Brother" as well as the well-documented malfeasance of big government. Colorado has long been a leader in allowing state residents to shield information from the government and everyone else.\par \par \uc2 To ensure that any ICE program does not lead to treating state residents unfairly, it's vital that police run everyone's name through the system when stopping the public for traffic infractions or more serious crimes, rather than just those with dark skin, Mexican accents and Spanish surnames. Also, these databases are often given to lapses and other troubles, adding time to police stops, especially those involving those with heavy accents.\par \par \uc2 The repeal begs for Hickenlooper's signature.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, any program that ushers unlicensed and uninsured drivers into the system only serves to benefit all of us. This and similar measures don't make immigration policy, but they do help Colorado live with the nation's ineffective and broken immigration laws. These measures realistically address the fact that millions of illegal immigrants are here, and they're here to stay. Allowing them to drive unlicensed and uninsured only compounds bad federal decisions, and it's individual, law-abiding drivers who have to pay the price.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.aurorasentinel.com/opinion/editorial-state-illegal-immigrant-bills-work-to-help-us-live-better-with-bad-federal-policy/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.aurorasentinel.com/opinion/editorial-state-illegal-immigrant-bills-work-to-help-us-live-better-with-bad-federal-policy/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130416e94g002fu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Some North Carolina lawmakers want to extend driving privileges to those living in North Carolina illegally while adding new enforcement measures, including a provision mirroring an Arizona law that authorizes law enforcement to check the legal status of people stopped for other legitimate reasons.\par \par \uc2 The bill, filed by four House Republicans, creates a separate class of restricted driver's permits and allows law enforcement to detain people suspected of living illegally in the U.S. for up to 24 hours following a stop or arrest to check their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 The legislation comes as the \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  looks ready to take up its own bipartisan legislation following a push from GOP leaders to moderate its tone toward the Latino community. Rep. Harry Warren, R-Rowan, and a primary sponsor, called the measure a "public safety" bill that strikes a balanced approach in an interview Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "To recognize that people here illegally are driving uninsured and untested and to do nothing about it is irresponsible," he said. "The federal government has tied our hands in so many ways with how we can address the illegal population, but this is one way we can."\par \par \uc2 The restricted licenses come with special identification numbers, a vertical format set apart from the usual horizontal design and a statement declaring the permit can't be used to verify legal residency. Applicants have to submit to criminal background checks, provide a passport or federal tax form, proof of insurance and proof of at least a year's residency in North Carolina that began prior to April 1, 2013.\par \par \uc2 The bill filed Wednesday also criminalizes producing false ID or using someone else's identification, with exceptions for attempts to purchase alcohol or cigarettes underage; bans the use of consular identification cards to establish identity or residency; restricts pre-trial release of immigrants in the country without permission in many cases and requires them to pay for the costs of incarceration. Under the bill, public contractors would have to verify the work eligibility of employees.\par \par \uc2 An estimated 325,000 immigrants in the country without permission lived in North Carolina as of 2010, up from 210,000 the decade before, according to the Pew Research Center. A proposal granting restricted IDs secured initial approval in the Colorado state Senate Wednesday. Four other states already issue some form of driver's permit to those who don't have permission to be in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Immigration advocates who were reached Thursday called the bill a sign of progress but remained skeptical about some provisions.\par \par \uc2 Maudia Melendez, director of Charlotte-based Jesus Ministry, said the bill helps bring immigrants "out of the shadows," but provisions such as the restriction against using consular ID present concerns.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to be big for our community, but at the same time I don't want them to give me this just to take away the rest of my freedom," she said. "I think what's going to happen is good -- not just for the immigrants but for the rest of the state."\par \par \uc2 Melendez said she recognizes the provision allowing for status checks during police stops opens the door for greater profiling and eventual deportation, especially given the unique design of the restricted IDs, but after a \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  decision upholding the measure, it's here to stay. Her group has pushed for driving privileges for years and helped craft the North Carolina bill.\par \par \uc2 Although anyone holding a restricted permit could be detained under the proposed law, it's designed to capture those who have committed serious felonies, Warren said.\par \par \uc2 "That's who we're targeting in this bill, not the guy who has overstayed his student visa or the guy picking vegetables for us," he said.\par \par \uc2 Ron Woodard, director of conservative immigration reform group NC Listen, said it's a misconception that most immigrants work in agriculture, and with the state's unemployment rate topping 9 percent, lawmakers shouldn't make it easier for them to find work.\par \par \uc2 "The bigger point we'd make is it looks like the North Carolina House wants to make it easier for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to get to a job that should go to a citizen," he said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  came out firmly against the bill, calling the goal of licensing immigrants worthwhile but noting the bill applies only to those living in the state prior to April 1. \uc2 Sarah Preston\uc2 , policy director at ACLU of North Carolina, argued the bill as a whole sanctions racial profiling and ratchets up penalties against one particular group that is mostly law-abiding.\par \par \uc2 "I think the biggest concern is it's really going to increase scrutiny -- all the provisions together -- against people law enforcement perceives to look foreign," she said.\par \par \uc2 House Democrats filed their own bill Thursday that would grant driving privileges to more immigrants in part by removing the requirement that a license can't be issued in most cases without an applicant's valid Social Security number. The bill lacks other provisions in the Republican measure. Another Democratic measure would grant in-state tuition to some students at University of North Carolina and community college campuses who are living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130412e94c00021\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Some North Carolina lawmakers want to extend driving privileges to those living in North Carolina illegally while adding new enforcement measures, including a provision mirroring an Arizona law that authorizes law enforcement to check the legal status of people stopped for other legitimate reasons.\par \par \uc2 The bill, filed by four House Republicans, creates a separate class of restricted driver's permits and allows law enforcement to detain people suspected of living illegally in the U.S. for up to 24 hours following a stop or arrest to check their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 The legislation comes as the \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  looks ready to take up its own bipartisan legislation following a push from GOP leaders to moderate its tone toward the Latino community. Rep. Harry Warren, R-Rowan, and a primary sponsor, called the measure a "public safety" bill that strikes a balanced approach in an interview Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "To recognize that people here illegally are driving uninsured and untested and to do nothing about it is irresponsible," he said. "The federal government has tied our hands in so many ways with how we can address the illegal population, but this is one way we can."\par \par \uc2 The restricted licenses come with special identification numbers, a vertical format set apart from the usual horizontal design and a statement declaring the permit can't be used to verify legal residency. Applicants have to submit to criminal background checks, provide a passport or federal tax form, proof of insurance and proof of at least a year's residency in North Carolina that began prior to April 1, 2013.\par \par \uc2 The bill also criminalizes producing false ID or using someone else's identification, with exceptions for attempts to purchase alcohol or cigarettes underage; bans the use of consular identification cards to establish identity or residency; restricts pre-trial release of immigrants in the country without permission in many cases and requires them to pay for the costs of incarceration. Under the bill, public contractors would have to verify the work eligibility of employees.\par \par \uc2 An estimated 325,000 immigrants in the country without permission lived in North Carolina as of 2010, up from 210,000 the decade before, according to the Pew Research Center. A proposal granting restricted IDs secured initial approval in the Colorado state Senate Wednesday. Four other states already issue some form of driver's permit to those who don't have permission to be in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Immigration advocates reached Wednesday called the bill a sign of progress but remained skeptical about some provisions.\par \par \uc2 Maudia Melendez, director of Charlotte-based Jesus Ministry, said the bill helps bring immigrants "out of the shadows," but provisions such as the restriction against using consular ID present concerns.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to be big for our community, but at the same time I don't want them to give me this just to take away the rest of my freedom," she said. "I think what's going to happen is good -- not just for the immigrants but for the rest of the state."\par \par \uc2 Melendez said she recognizes the provision allowing for status checks during police stops opens the door for greater profiling and eventual deportation, especially given the unique design of the restricted IDs, but after a \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  decision upholding the measure, it's here to stay. Her group has pushed for driving privileges for years and helped craft the North Carolina bill.\par \par \uc2 Although anyone holding a restricted permit could be detained under the proposed law, it's designed to capture those who have committed serious felonies, Warren said.\par \par \uc2 "That's who we're targeting in this bill, not the guy who has overstayed his student visa or the guy picking vegetables for us," he said.\par \par \uc2 Ron Woodard, director of conservative immigration reform group NC Listen, said it's a misconception that most immigrants work in agriculture, and with the state's unemployment rate topping 9 percent, lawmakers shouldn't make it easier for them to find work.\par \par \uc2 "The bigger point we'd make is it looks like the North Carolina House wants to make it easier for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to get to a job that should go to a citizen," he said.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU came out firmly against the bill, calling the goal of licensing immigrants worthwhile but noting the bill applies only to those living in the state prior to April 1. \uc2 Sarah Preston\uc2 , policy director at ACLU of North Carolina, argued the bill as a whole sanctions racial profiling and ratchets up penalties against one particular group that is mostly law-abiding.\par \par \uc2 "I think the biggest concern is it's really going to increase scrutiny -- all the provisions together -- against people law enforcement perceives to look foreign," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130411e94b001db\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc19}{\*\bkmkend toc19}\b \uc2 Recent Kansas editorials\b0\par\par\uc2 By The Associated Press   \par \uc2 1,759 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 April 2013\par 08:31\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2013.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Wichita Eagle, March 30\par \par \uc2 Be open to Medicaid expansion\par \par \uc2 Good for Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, for being open to expanding Medicaid in Kansas. The rest of the Legislature and Gov. Sam Brownback should be, too.\par \par \uc2 During a debate last week on an amendment to require legislative approval for any effort to expand Medicaid, Wagle said she supported the amendment (which passed), but not because she was trying to block expansion.\par \par \uc2 "We need to remain flexible here in this state and find our own Kansas-based solutions," Wagle later told the Topeka Capital-Journal. "If that means drawing down some of those federal funds, we need to be flexible in how we draw them down."\par \par \uc2 That's smart.\par \par \uc2 A study by the Kansas Hospital Association concluded that expansion would enable more than 150,000 Kansans to get needed insurance. It also would inject more than $3 billion into the state's economy and create 4,000 jobs over the next seven years. What's more, expansion could save the state more money than it costs.\par \par \uc2 Conversely, not expanding Medicaid would be a major financial blow to the state's hospitals. That's because the Affordable Care Act reduces payments to help hospitals that serve low-income uninsured patients (in expectation that many of these patients would be joining Medicaid). Losing this funding could put some small hospitals out of business.\par \par \uc2 Wagle is interested in crafting more of a free-market approach to expansion. She has cited Arkansas, which has received preliminary approval to use federal Medicaid money to help low-income residents pay premiums for private insurance (an idea that is similar to the Obamacare insurance marketplace).\par \par \uc2 "One thing we need to do is keep doors open, keep talking and keep trying to find Kansas solutions," she said.\par \par \uc2 Wagle's pragmatism isn't out of character. In 2008, she supported an expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program in Kansas. She called SCHIP a "tried-and-true program" and noted that the federal government would pick up most of the cost of expansion.\par \par \uc2 That's even more the case now, as the federal government will cover the full cost of this expansion until 2016, and nearly all the cost afterward.\par \par \uc2 Wagle also has noted that if Kansas doesn't opt in to Medicaid expansion, other states that do will benefit from Kansans' tax dollars.\par \par \uc2 "Kansas is losing out, and it does affect our health care industry and it does affect the quality of our services," she told the Lawrence Journal-World.\par \par \uc2 For his part, Brownback remains noncommittal, even as more than half a dozen GOP governors recently have announced they are expanding Medicaid in their states.\par \par \uc2 "We're open on it," Brownback said. "We're very concerned about the long-term costs. I want to listen to the Legislature."\par \par \uc2 He should start by listening to Wagle.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Topeka Capital-Journal, March 27\par \par \uc2 Identity theft a chilling ordeal\par \par \uc2 The long ordeal Candida L. Gutierrez had to suffer after another woman literally stole her life is something that shouldn't be wished upon anyone, although it should be enough to convince everyone of the importance of protecting their own identity.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, the worst is behind Gutierrez -- although some legal clean-up still remains to be done -- and she can feel comfortable about moving on with her life without the illegal shadow that has tormented her for almost 12 years.\par \par \uc2 That shadow and imposter, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Benita Cardona-Gonzalez, a Topeka resident, was sentenced Monday in federal court in Wichita to 18 months in prison for possessing fraudulent identification documents, after which time she will be deported.\par \par \uc2 Some readers of CJOnline.com, who added their comments to a story by The Associated Press about Gutierrez and Cardona-Gonzalez, suggested an 18-month prison term was not nearly enough punishment for the damage and pain inflicted by the identity thief.\par \par \uc2 It's certainly difficult to disagree with the readers on that point, but the prosecutor who negotiated the deal with the defense attorney for Cardona-Gonzalez must have thought it was the best way to close the case. The judge handling the case also had reservations about the short sentence but decided to go with the negotiated deal.\par \par \uc2 Frankly, it is what it is and Gutierrez, a schoolteacher in Houston, now has her life back and her tormentor can do her no more harm. Her experience, however, should serve as a warning to all of us.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press story didn't note how Cardona-Gonzalez managed to steal Gutierrez's identity in the first place, but once she had it, the Mexico native used it to get bank accounts, a job, driver's license and a home mortgage, all in Gutierrez's name.\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez, meanwhile, was turned down for a mortgage and couldn't convince the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  she had been the target of identity theft. She even had to suffer the humiliation of being forced to file her federal income tax forms using a special identification number usually reserved for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 During sentencing, the attorney for Cardona-Gonzalez said his client didn't have an understanding of how difficult it would be for Gutierrez to get her identity back. That's difficult to believe, given how deeply Cardona-Gonzalez immersed herself in her false identity and the fact she was brazen enough to claim she was the identity theft victim and was even issued a new Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 Apparently, it's easier to lose an identity than to reclaim it. That's why it's important everyone protect their own and be careful about sharing personal information that could be used to create, on paper, a duplicate.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Hays Daily News, March 28\par \par \uc2 In-state tuition program still a sensible approach.\par \par \uc2 Students attending postsecondary institutions in Kansas fall into two categories: Those who pay in-state tuition and those who pay out-of-state rates. The difference is significant. In-state rates are less than half what the non-resident pays.\par \par \uc2 In 2004, the Legislature decided any student who graduated from a Kansas high school and had lived in the state for at least three years qualified for in-state tuition rates -- regardless of residency status. Lawmakers then were under the impression it wasn't fair to punish children with higher tuition merely because their parents weren't legal citizens. The law didn't benefit a great number of Kansas kids, nor did it raise many objections....\par \par \uc2 A challenge to the status quo emerged this year, courtesy of a state official whose passion appears to make life as difficult as possible for immigrants. Secretary of State Kris Kobach was the lead supporter of repealing in-state tuition for Kansas students without legal residency.\par \par \uc2 ... First of all, this year there are 630 immigrants paying in-state tuition. Of those, more than 500 attend community college. Is Secretary Kobach suggesting families enter the country and live here for three years for the primary purpose of getting discounts on two years' worth of community college? That is difficult to imagine.\par \par \uc2 We don't believe the secretary is looking at revenue-enhancements for the schools, either. If all 630 students were to switch to the higher rate, the incremental dollar gain would be $1.8 million. Of course, assuming those families merely were gaming the system, they wouldn't be in Kansas. The loss of those 630 college students would be $3.9 million.\par \par \uc2 It sounds as if Kobach, who sideline business is making life difficult for immigrants around the country, just wanted to stir things up some more in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Thankfully, the House committee didn't bite. No action was taken on the bill.\par \par \uc2 And at least one lawmaker reframed the conversation in a manner we found refreshing. Rep. Ponka-We Victors, D-Wichita and the only Native American serving in the Legislature, offered this: "I think it's funny, Mr. Kobach, because when you mention \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , I think of all of you."\par \par \uc2 We hope this is the last we hear about attempts to punish Kansas teens for the decisions of their parents.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Hutchinson News, March 28\par \par \uc2 Gun control\par \par \uc2 Allowing concealed guns on campus is not the solution to stopping school violence\par \par \uc2 Kansas is one step closer to allowing employees of public schools and colleges to carry concealed guns, thanks to legislation that cleared the state Senate on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Our lawmakers, who approved the measure by a 35-5 vote, are making a huge mistake - one with the potential for deadly consequences and one that should cause parents everywhere to be concerned for the safety of their children.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press reported that the bill expands the number of public buildings into which people with concealed-carry permits can bring their weapons. The measure includes a provision allowing local school boards, community and technical college boards and state university administrators to designate employees who could carry concealed weapons, even if such firearms are banned from campus buildings.\par \par \uc2 The House has already approved a similar measure, and a final version is likely to emerge from negotiations between the two chambers next week. In addition, gun-rights supporters expected senators to consider another proposal next week challenging federal regulation of some firearms.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, House members also approved a separate bill declaring that the federal government has no power to regulate firearms, ammunition and accessories, such as holsters, that are manufactured, sold and kept in Kansas. The measure also makes it a felony for any employee or agent of the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  to attempt to enforce any law, regulation, order or treaty affecting such items.\par \par \uc2 All of this should be cause for concern.\par \par \uc2 The way to combat gun-toting lunatics is not by bringing more firearms onto our school campuses. A bullet, whether fired by a deranged monster or a school employee trying his darnedest to stop a melee, still has the potential for tragedy.\par \par \uc2 Friendly fire is equally dangerous.\par \par \uc2 Bringing another firearm onto a campus is not the answer. This bill's passage is simply a knee-jerk reaction to December's deadly school shooting in Newtown, Conn. Lawmakers have feasted on the fears of the American public, which is slowly - and begrudgingly - coming to the conclusion that there is no easy to solution to this heart-wrenching dilemma.\par \par \uc2 If someone wants to inflict harm, it can be done - in a despicable headline-making way.\par \par \uc2 More guns on hand would only exacerbate an already deadly situation.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130402e942001k6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - A Montana judge has blocked part of a voter-approved law that requires proof of citizenship or legal standing to receive state services, but he left most of it intact to "preserve the intent of the people."\par \par \uc2 The law approved overwhelmingly by voters in November requires a person to provide proof that he or she is eligible for services from unemployment benefits to crime-victim assistance.\par \par \uc2 Immigration-rights attorneys challenged the law in December, saying Legislative Referendum 121 violated constitutional rights to privacy, due process and equal protection.\par \par \uc2 They said it requires state agencies to determine who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and turn them over to federal authorities. They asked District Judge Jeffrey Sherlock of Helena to issue an injunction that would block the entire law while the lawsuit is heard.\par \par \uc2 Sherlock said in his Tuesday decision that it is unreasonable for individuals to expect to receive state benefits without showing their eligibility. If it results in an immigration proceeding against a person, that would be undertaken by the federal government, not the state, which would not be a violation of privacy, Sherlock ruled.\par \par \uc2 However, Sherlock said the state may not use the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements program to verify a person's immigration status, a program that LR 121 specifies as a check. The Department of Homeland Security has prohibited use of that program to conclude an individual is violating U.S. immigration law.\par \par \uc2 But because the law says a person's status can be checked by "any other lawful method," Sherlock upheld that portion of the initiative.\par \par \uc2 Sherlock also blocked enforcement of the law's definition of "illegal alien."\par \par \uc2 It defines an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  as a person who is not a citizen of the U.S. or remains unlawfully in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Sherlock ruled there are circumstances in which an individual can enter the country illegally but remain lawfully. Plaintiffs' attorney Shahid Haque-Hausrath submitted affidavits from eight immigrants who crossed the border illegally but have since won legal residency and are living in Montana.\par \par \uc2 Aside from the verification checks and the partial block of the definition of illegal alien, the rest of the law can remain intact for now, Sherlock ruled.\par \par \uc2 "The court finds that it can enter the orders mentioned above and preserve the intent of the people as evidenced in LR 121," Sherlock wrote.\par \par \uc2 State Department of Justice spokesman \uc2 John Barnes\uc2  said the ruling allows essentially all of the law to remain in effect.\par \par \uc2 "Eighty percent of Montanans voted to ensure that state benefits go only to those who are eligible to receive them, and the judge's ruling allows the state to implement the peoples' will," Barnes said in an email Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Plaintiffs' attorneys considered the ruling a partial victory.\par \par \uc2 The partial injunction "now alters the manner that the state can apply the law while this lawsuit is pending.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Hutchinson News, March 22\par \par \uc2 Shotgun Legislature\par \par \uc2 Maybe Gov. Sam Brownback is shooting from the hip, or maybe the Kansas Legislature has an itchy trigger finger.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the cause, one thing is certain: 2013 is the year of the Shotgun Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Record-setting campaign spending in 2012 led to the election of many conservative legislators who won favor from some of the state's largest lobbyist groups, thus purging moderate Republicans from the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 As soon as this new Brownback-compliant Legislature convened in January, members began shot-gunning a wide variety of bills in both the House and Senate. No issue has been out of reach of the Legislature's birdshot - corporate farming, judicial appointments, taxes, workers rights, restrictions on lobbying (not from business, just from people), election laws and immigration, to name a few.\par \par \uc2 This approach betrays a dire sense of urgency from the governor and his legislative followers - almost as if these changes must happen now, before people have a chance to figure out the truth, and perhaps have a change of heart.\par \par \uc2 There is good reason for that impatience. Given time to research and ponder the legislation, most Kansans would find much of it unpalatable. Some might realize a vast difference between what we've been told and what we could end up living with if some of these bills become law.\par \par \uc2 For instance, a bill against using public money to pay for lobbyists sounds reasonable on its surface. But deeper exploration reveals the bill doesn't solve the fundamental problem that lobbyists dominate lawmaking; it simply removes lobbyists that most closely represent the people and in effect silences the voices of the common person while giving well-heeled organizations a louder voice.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, a corporate farming law seems like a fine idea to some when it's gussied up in the language of economic development, jobs and investment. But its sourness comes out once people realize the legislation also robs counties and their residents of their right to control their own backyards.\par \par \uc2 A tax cut, who doesn't like the idea of a nice big tax cut? But already Kansans are biting down on the pit in that bill and realizing the pain might well come in higher taxes elsewhere or reduced services in their communities.\par \par \uc2 As for unions, Kansans have never much liked them anyway - especially those unions that represent teachers and government workers who earn their livings from taxpayer dollars. Another shotgun blast brought a flurry of bills designed to erode union power and membership. Yet, in the process, lawmakers have sought to undo civil service protections, which would allow public employees to be hired or fired based on their political affiliation and the changing winds of each election season.\par \par \uc2 A shotgun Legislature, indeed.\par \par \uc2 But shotguns aren't used for their precision or accuracy; they're used to spread out a wide pattern in the hope that at least one piece of shot will strike its target. It's a great tool for bird hunting but a terrible approach to lawmaking.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Hays Daily News, March 22\par \par \uc2 In-state tuition\par \par \uc2 Students attending postsecondary institutions in Kansas fall into two categories: Those who pay in-state tuition and those who pay out-of-state rates. The difference is significant. In-state rates are less than half what the non-resident pays.\par \par \uc2 In 2004, the Legislature decided any student who graduated from a Kansas high school and had lived in the state for at least three years qualified for in-state tuition rates -- regardless of residency status. Lawmakers then were under the impression it wasn't fair to punish children with higher tuition merely because their parents weren't legal citizens. The law didn't benefit a great number of Kansas kids, nor did it raise many objections. The grumbling that did occur dissipated after learning the state wasn't paying for the students to attend college.\par \par \uc2 A challenge to the status quo emerged this year, courtesy of a state official whose passion appears to make life as difficult as possible for immigrants. Secretary of State Kris Kobach was the lead supporter of repealing in-state tuition for Kansas students without legal residency.\par \par \uc2 "I think that is an absurd reverse incentive," Kobach said during House Bill 2192's hearing in front of the House Federal and State Affairs Committee. "If you follow the law, we're charging you three times more."\par \par \uc2 Kobach was referring to the fact Regents schools charge out-of-state tuition to students from foreign countries, and those youths need to obtain student visas. The "reverse incentive," in Kobach's mind, is that families entering the country illegally get a benefit they don't deserve.\par \par \uc2 First of all, this year there are 630 immigrants paying in-state tuition. Of those, more than 500 attend community college. Is Secretary Kobach suggesting families enter the country and live here for three years for the primary purpose of getting discounts on two years' worth of community college? That is difficult to imagine.\par \par \uc2 We don't believe the secretary is looking at revenue-enhancements for the schools, either. If all 630 students were to switch to the higher rate, the incremental dollar gain would be $1.8 million. Of course, assuming those families merely were gaming the system, they wouldn't be in Kansas. The loss of those 630 college students would be $3.9 million.\par \par \uc2 It sounds as if Kobach, who sideline business is making life difficult for immigrants around the country, just wanted to stir things up some more in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Thankfully, the House committee didn't bite. No action was taken on the bill.\par \par \uc2 And at least one lawmaker reframed the conversation in a manner we found refreshing. Rep. Ponka-We Victors, D-Wichita and the only Native American serving in the Legislature, offered this: "I think it's funny, Mr. Kobach, because when you mention \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , I think of all of you."\par \par \uc2 We hope this is the last we hear about attempts to punish Kansas teens for the decisions of their parents.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Wichita Eagle, March 22\par \par \uc2 Speak now on budget\par \par \uc2 The tax and budget debates of the past week have stirred worries and further demonstrated how the Kansas Legislature's makeup and fiscal priorities have changed. Kansans who care about the budget areas being slighted amid the tax-cutting zeal need to make themselves heard loudly and soon.\par \par \uc2 The chambers' negotiators must reconcile the plans now that the House has declined to extend the higher sales-tax rate after July 1 (as the governor and Senate want to do) or to divert $382 million in sales-tax revenue from the transportation plan over the next two years (as the House Taxation Committee wanted).\par \par \uc2 The House and Senate would cut funding by $30 million and $15 million, respectively, for the higher-education system of state universities, community colleges and technical schools - which officials say will further drive up tuition rates and endanger programs. Only the Senate would increase K-12 per-pupil funding, and then only by $14 per pupil in fiscal 2014, doing little to ease the severe budget problems districts face statewide.\par \par \uc2 Area priorities at risk include the National Center for Aviation Training and scheduled highway improvements.\par \par \uc2 Despite the tenacious efforts on the floor of Sen. Carolyn McGinn, R-Sedgwick, the Senate-passed budget lacks funding to help Sedgwick County keep the Judge James Riddel Boys Ranch open, to help community mental health centers recover from the deep cuts they've sustained, or to support the arts at the level Kansans fought for two years ago. As it is, the Kansas Creative Arts Industries Commission would receive just $200,000 - a $500,000 cut from the current year and far from the kind of support needed to reclaim the $1.2 million in annual regional and federal matching grants that enriched Kansas' cultural life.\par \par \uc2 The week also saw another failed effort by Rep. Jim Ward, D-Wichita, to give $45 million to cities and counties for lowering property taxes - which are the taxes Kansans fear and loathe most.\par \par \uc2 "At last we're cutting budgets and trying to save the taxpayers some money," said House Speaker Ray Merrick, R-Stilwell.\par \par \uc2 Yes, but with what Rep. Nile Dillmore, D-Wichita, called "a giant leap of faith" - and with far too little regard for the impact that decimating the state's tax base will have on schools, college students and those who rely on state-funded social services.\par \par \uc2 Let it be said again that the state's revenue crisis is entirely of its own making because of Gov. Sam Brownback's historic bill last year eliminating income taxes for 191,000 businesses and farms and cutting income-tax rates for individuals. Now, when lawmakers should be cautiously trying to repair the damage and mitigate more, they seem eager to cut spending to clear Brownback's desired "glide path to zero" income tax.\par \par \uc2 If Kansans have a problem with that, it's now time to say so.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Kansas City Star, March 20\par \par \uc2 Kansas abortion bill is cruel overreach\par \par \uc2 With the passage of an anti-abortion bill on Wednesday, Kansas House members revealed themselves as callous and backward-thinking.\par \par \uc2 Along with imposing new restrictions on patients and providers, the House rejected an amendment to change current law and allow abortions after 22 weeks if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest. In rejecting pleas to allow those exceptions, the bill's supporters displayed a shocking lack of empathy for women.\par \par \uc2 Young girls, especially, may not understand or acknowledge the physical changes resulting from a pregnancy until that pregnancy is well under way. By removing the option of abortion, legislators are imposing their will and beliefs on people in desperate situations.\par \par \uc2 The bill contains several overbearing and offensive requirements for doctors. The worst is a requirement that physicians must falsely inform patients that abortion may increase the risk of breast cancer.\par \par \uc2 An abortion-breast cancer link is wishful thinking on the part of anti-abortion crusaders, buoyed by a few small, early studies. Later, more comprehensive research found no connection. In the early 2000s, the \uc2 National Cancer Institute\uc2  convened more than 100 leading experts to review the research. They concluded that neither abortion nor miscarriage increases a woman's chances of developing breast cancer.\par \par \uc2 But Kansas Rep. Lance Kinzer, an Olathe Republican who is the driver of the Legislature's anti-abortion legislation, asserted in debate that the Legislature has the authority to tell doctors what to tell patients, even in the face of doubt or conflicting studies.\par \par \uc2 Kinzer's thinking is arrogant and harmful. Why would a talented young doctor want to practice in a state that requires physicians to perpetuate a discredited scare tactic?\par \par \uc2 The 70-page House bill's overreaching effort to deny women the right to a private medical decision even prohibits a woman from deducting the cost of an abortion as a medical expense on her income tax form. Abortion providers could no longer claim an exemption from state sales taxes for medical supplies, as other medical providers do.\par \par \uc2 In testimony to the triumph of zealotry, the House voted 92-31 for the abortion restrictions. We hope the Senate will show some compassion for young women facing the anguish of an unwanted, late-term pregnancy, and understand the negative consequences of promoting a blatant falsehood.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130326e93q001o1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

John McCain sets low expectations for immigration reform legislation at Arizona town hall\b0\par\par\uc2 By CRISTINA SILVA   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 516 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 March 2013\par 20:12\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2013.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Sen. John McCain worked to lower expectations surrounding his plan for immigration reform and hinted at difficult disagreements in Congress during an emotional town hall meeting in his home state of Arizona on Monday that saw people on both sides of the debate exchange fiery insults.\par \par \uc2 The raucous exchange illustrated the passion of the debate across the nation as Congress weighs what could be the biggest changes to immigration law in nearly 30 years.\par \par \uc2 At one point, a 25-year-old woman stood up and begged McCain and others not to call her and her family illegal immigrants and instead use the term undocumented. Some laughed at her, and one man called out, "I'd like to be called Irish."\par \par \uc2 Another testy exchange saw a Hispanic businessman complain about being pulled over and asked for proof of citizenship near Tucson. "We are human, we are not slaves," he said. An elderly white woman yelled back, "but you're illegal."\par \par \uc2 The town hall meeting followed a more one-sided, but equally heated exchange at a town hall in February in suburban Phoenix, where McCain faced down rebukes from a largely older, white crowd opposed to immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 McCain said the so-called Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of lawmakers working on immigration legislation in the Senate, has agreed on more work visas for workers and protections for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children, but declined to provide specific details. He cautioned that he was "guardedly optimistic" that Congress would pass reform this year, even as President Barack Obama renewed his call to lawmakers Monday to overhaul the nation's immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "Whether we will agree or not, I don't know," McCain told the more than 150 people gathered at a Phoenix community center.\par \par \uc2 McCain repeatedly urged civility during the meeting Monday, but he also stepped in and took sides.\par \par \uc2 He told the young woman who asked to be called an undocumented immigrant that he would continue to use the term illegal because it's accurate. Many civil rights and Hispanic groups consider the term \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  offensive.\par \par \uc2 "You can call it whatever you want. I think there is a big difference between someone who does something illegal and not being documented," McCain said, earning cheers from those opposed to immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 When immigration activists stood up to thank him for trying to get something done on the issue, McCain warned, "You are not going to be completely happy with this legislation."\par \par \uc2 At another point, McCain and some Hispanic activists laughed at a man who asked how he and other immigration critics could stop "amnesty." McCain also cut off a Mexican woman who said immigrants should come to the country legally as she did.\par \par \uc2 "It's not acceptable to have 11 million people living in the shadows of this country," McCain said. "If you believe they are not living in the shadows, I'd like to know what the hell shadows are?"\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130326e93q00012\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - For almost 12 years, a Houston elementary school teacher and an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  living in Topeka have engaged in a tug of war to claim the identity of Candida L. Gutierrez in a case that has put a face on the growing crime of "total identity theft" in the United States.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the real Candida L. Gutierrez saw her identity thief, Benita Cardona-Gonzalez, for the first time. Their encounter came inside a federal courtroom in Wichita, where Cardona-Gonzalez, a Mexican national, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for possessing fraudulent identification documents.\par \par \uc2 The plea deal Cardona-Gonzalez struck with prosecutors in January gave her less prison time, but guaranteed she would not contest her deportation. She pleaded guilty to an aggravated felony, which typically results in automatic deportation.\par \par \uc2 When Gutierrez's identity was stolen, the thief didn't stop at opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts. Cardona-Gonzalez assumed Gutierrez's persona completely, using it to get a job, a driver's license, a mortgage and medical care for her children. She even put the stolen name on the birth certificates of her two U.S.-born children in the spots where they list who's the mother.\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez and her husband, Brenden Marquardt, flew to Wichita from Houston for the court proceedings hoping to gain a sense of closure.\par \par \uc2 "I wanted to make sure I could see her face and she could see my face -- so that she knew the face of the person who paid for living her dream," Gutierrez said. "Because her dream was my nightmare."\par \par \uc2 Cardona-Gonzales briefly glanced at Gutierrez while giving a hurried courtroom statement in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 "I accept my punishment and I accept my responsibility and I ask forgiveness of Ms. Gutierrez," she said.\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez first learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage. Each year she trudges to the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  with her birth certificate, driver's license, passport and even school yearbooks to prove her identity and clear her employment record.\par \par \uc2 She spends hours on the phone with creditors and credit bureaus, fills out affidavits and has yet to clean up her credit history. Her tax records are a mess. She even once phoned the impostor's Kansas employer in a futile effort to find some relief.\par \par \uc2 Both women had claimed they were identity theft victims and sought to get new Social Security numbers. The \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  turned down Gutierrez's request and instead issued a new number to the woman impersonating her.\par \par \uc2 And in another ironic twist, Gutierrez was forced to file her federal income tax forms using a special identification number usually reserved for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Their struggle finally came to a head when Gutierrez got married a year ago, and her new husband set out to clear her credit history. He traced the identity thief to Topeka and on the Internet he found a press release from the U.S. attorney's office in Kansas about the prosecutions of other illegal immigrants working at \uc2 Reser's Fine Foods\uc2 , the same manufacturer where Cardona-Gonzalez worked. He contacted federal authorities in Kansas, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Anderson took up their case.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think we would ever have solved this issue without Brent's help," Marquardt said.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Eric Melgren called the case a "classic example" of the harm done by identity theft, saying people who characterize the cases as victimless crimes are uninformed. He said he had some reservations about the 18-month prison sentence and whether it was enough, but decided it was acceptable to meet sentencing objectives and bring closure to the victim.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorney Matthew Works told the court that his client didn't have an understanding of how difficult it is for the victim to get her identity back. He said after the hearing that Cardona-Gonzalez has authorized him to do anything he can to "try to fix it" so Gutierrez could regain her identity.\par \par \uc2 Still pending before the court is a prosecution request that Melgren order the Kansas Office of Vital Statistics to correct the name of the mother on the birth certificates issued to Cardona-Gonzalez's two children who were born in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Anderson is also helping Gutierrez obtain a new Social Security number and sort out the legal tangle from the foreclosure of the house Cardona-Gonzalez bought in Topeka under the false identity.\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez said she did not know whether Cardona-Gonzalez's apology in court was sincere, or whether it should even be up to her to forgive her.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to think about it anymore," Gutierrez said after the hearing. "It is done."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130325e93p002xk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HELENA, Mont. (AP) - Eight men who entered the U.S. illegally but have since become permanent residents say a new Montana law wrongly puts them at risk of being denied services and treats them as second-class people.\par \par \uc2 The men from Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador told their stories in recent sworn statements in support of a legal challenge to the law, which was put to Montana voters last fall by Republican legislators and overwhelmingly approved.\par \par \uc2 The law requires proof of citizenship or legal standing from any applicant for state services, from unemployment and disability benefits to assistance for crime victims. If an applicant can't prove his legal status, the state agency is required to turn that person's name over to federal immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 Agencies have not yet released any regulations on how they plan to enforce the law or how they will train employees to check for proof.\par \par \uc2 An immigration-rights group and the state's largest labor union are asking a judge to block the state from applying the law and to strike down it down as unconstitutional. Among its problems, a Helena immigration attorney said Thursday, the law provides a definition for an "illegal alien" as someone who is not a U.S. citizen and who has unlawfully entered or remains unlawfully in the country.\par \par \uc2 So even if they have legal residency status now, people who entered the country illegally would still be considered illegal immigrants, Shahid Haque-Hausrath said.\par \par \uc2 "There are those people who think those who illegally entered the country should never be allowed to legalize their status," he said. "But these are people who went through the correct procedures to get their green cards."\par \par \uc2 They include Luis Alberto Alonzo, 42, who illegally entered the U.S. in 1989 and is the father of two developmentally disabled children, one of whom has cerebral palsy, is blind, has lung and heart damage and has seizures.\par \par \uc2 An immigration judge granted Alonzo permanent legal resident status in 2011, and he depends on state support to help his sons. But he is concerned that the new law will target him as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  again and he will be denied the services upon which he relies, he wrote in his affidavit.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know what I would do without that support. Finances are a constant struggle and I barely make ends meet," Alonzo wrote. "Now I must also deal with the threat that I will be denied state services because the state believes I am an `illegal alien.'"\par \par \uc2 Another man, Mexican-born Mauricio Jimenez-Contreras, was granted permanent residency last year after entering the country illegally in 1999.\par \par \uc2 "Under this law, I would be treated like a second-class person and I would always feel like my options were limited because of the way I entered the country illegally," Jimenez-Contreras wrote.\par \par \uc2 Montana Department of Justice spokesman \uc2 John Barnes\uc2  did not have an immediate comment. But earlier this month, Montana solicitor general Lawrence VanDyke asked Judge Jeffrey Sherlock to dismiss the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 In his request, VanDyke described the lawsuit as "speculative" because nobody has shown any real threat of an injury as a result of the law.\par \par \uc2 Disagreeing with the law or worrying about its possible effects are not grounds for a legal challenge, VanDyke wrote.\par \par \uc2 Haque-Hausrath said the affidavits prove that the risk is real to a segment of legal residents whom the law overlooks.\par \par \uc2 Sherlock has not ruled on the state's request to dismiss the case or the request to block the law made by plaintiffs Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance, Montana Education Association-Montana Federation of Teachers and Montana resident Alisha Blair.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130321e93l002p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 586 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 March 2013\par 16:37\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2013.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALEM, Ore. (AP) - The Oregon Senate voted Thursday to allow some young illegal immigrants to pay resident college tuition if they were brought to the United States as children, sending the measure to Gov. John Kitzhaber who has promised to sign it.\par \par \uc2 The Senate's approval in a 19-11 vote comes 10 years after the measure was first proposed. Immigrant-rights advocates erupted in cheers the moment the bill passed, their applause echoing through the Capitol as they congratulated each other, hugged lawmakers and posed for photos.\par \par \uc2 "I can't believe it finally happened," said Karla Castaneda, a junior at Parkrose High School in Portland whose family immigrated illegally when she was 4. "Hope is with me. I know I will be able to go to college."\par \par \uc2 Critics said the state shouldn't be subsidizing a college education for people who violated the law and won't be able to work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "Some of these folks who believe in the Constitution and believe in the rule of law need to be represented today," said Sen. Tim Knopp, a Bend Republican who voted against the measure.\par \par \uc2 At least 14 other states allow illegal immigrants to pay in-state college tuition. Colorado's Legislature approved a similar bill this month, and Gov. John Hickenlooper has said he'll sign it.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants in Oregon pay college tuition at the rate charged to nonresident students, which is about $20,000 more than the cost for Oregon residents.\par \par \uc2 Starting next school year, the measure would allow students to qualify for in-state tuition if they've attended an Oregon high school for at least three years and lived in the United States for at least five. They'd also have to sign an affidavit swearing they'll apply to legalize their immigration status as soon as they are eligible.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants can't legally work in the United States, but proponents say President Barack Obama's push for a federal immigration overhaul could create a pathway to citizenship for many. They say children have no control over the decision to immigrate without legal documents.\par \par \uc2 "It is just plain wrong to hold hostage the future of kids and young adults because of choices their parents have made," said Sen. Chris Edwards, D-Eugene.\par \par \uc2 The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Office estimated that the bill would increase the state's revenue by $335,000 over the next two years and by an additional $1.6 million between 2015 and 2017. The \uc2 Oregon University\uc2  System estimated that 38 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students would take advantage of the resident tuition rates during the next two years and 80 more students would take part in the two years after that.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Doug Whitsett, R-Klamath Falls, said he was skeptical of the numbers and expected many more illegal immigrants to enroll.\par \par \uc2 "Many of the people that we represent have a lot of angst about this bill," Whitsett said. "Many are angry about what they perceive to be the inequity represented by the concept of this bill."\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would not be eligible for state or federal financial aid, and they'd be subject to the same university entrance requirements as other applicants.\par \par \uc2 "They're not asking for guarantees. They're not asking for commitments. They simply want a chance," said Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, who first proposed the measure in 2003.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130321e93l002fy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - An emotional crowd gathered for a House committee hearing on a measure that seeks to repeal in-state tuition for Kansas students without legal residency.\par \par \uc2 The measure under consideration in the House Federal and State Affairs Committee would repeal the nearly 10-year-old statute that allows students who graduate from Kansas high schools and have lived in Kansas for at least three years to pay in-state tuition at state universities and community colleges, regardless of their residency status, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported Wednesday ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/Z2kNlF"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/Z2kNlF}}}\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 Kim Voth, a Wichita school counselor, said that before coming to testify before the committee, she spoke with one of her students who used the in-state tuition law to get an education degree and has since become a U.S. citizen and a teacher.\par \par \uc2 "I asked her what I should say today," Voth said, beginning to cry. "She got very quiet, then said, `Please tell them that my college degree changed my life.'"\par \par \uc2 Fred Logan, of the Kansas Board of Regents, said more than 500 of the 630 immigrants currently accessing in-state tuition attend community colleges. He said the 2004 law treats students without legal status fairly.\par \par \uc2 Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the repeal bill's chief proponent, argued that natives of foreign countries who follow the legal process of getting student visas to attend Kansas universities have to pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 "I think that is an absurd reverse incentive," Kobach said. "If you follow the law, we're charging you three times more."\par \par \uc2 The biggest response from the crowded gallery came when Rep. Ponka-We Victors, D-Wichita, ended a series of questions to Kobach.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's funny, Mr. Kobach, because when you mention \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , I think of all of you," said Victors, the lone Native American in the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 People in the gallery then applauded, which is rare in such hearings. The committee did not take action on the bill.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Topeka (Kan.)

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A federal judge on Wednesday struck down a section of a Georgia law that would have made it a crime to knowingly harbor or transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  while committing another crime, from speeding to more serious violations.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Thrash issued an order to scrap that section of the law, saying that a federal appeals court has already found it to be pre-empted by federal law. He also ordered the state to inform several state agencies that would have been involved in enforcing that provision of his decision.\par \par \uc2 A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in August that a preliminary injunction on that part of the 2011 law could remain in place, and the state decided not to appeal that decision to the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Georgia is one of several states that followed Arizona's lead in passing a tough crackdown on illegal immigration in 2010. Several of the laws include similar harboring and transporting provisions.\par \par \uc2 Thrash's order was expected, but Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  involved in the Georgia law's challenge, said the order still marks a victory because Thrash is the first federal judge to permanently strike down the harboring and transporting provision of a state law targeting illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "We're very happy about it," Jadwat said. "It's not just us who should be happy, though. It's everyone in the state of Georgia because this makes it clear people aren't going to be prosecuted by the state for innocently helping their friends."\par \par \uc2 Lauren Kane, a spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, said Wednesday's order merely implements the 11th Circuit's ruling.\par \par \uc2 Thrash in December lifted his preliminary injunction on another section of the law that authorizes law enforcement to verify the immigration status of criminal suspects who fail to produce proper identification after the 11th Circuit ruled that it should be allowed to go into effect. The full legal challenge to the law, which alleges it is unconstitutional and is pre-empted by federal law, could drag on for years,\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130320e93k002c9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - In a story March 15 about a lawsuit brought by a U.S. citizen who says she was illegally detained as a possible \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , The Associated Press erroneously attributed the following comment: "Ms. Morales is a U.S. citizen. She's been a U.S. citizen since 1995. She has a right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. It's basic constitutional law." The comment was from Kate Desormeau of the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 , not U.S. District Judge Jack McConnell.\par \par \uc2 A corrected version of the story is below:\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials want RI lawsuit dismissed\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials seeking dismissal of US citizen's lawsuit over alleged illegal detention\par \par \uc2 By MICHELLE R. SMITH\par \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \par \uc2 PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Federal and state officials on Friday asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of a U.S. citizen who says she was illegally detained as a possible \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ada Morales, of North Providence, says her constitutional rights were violated when she was detained in 2009 for about a day at the state prison. Morales, who was born in Guatemala and became a citizen in 1995, says she told authorities she was a citizen but was held anyway. Her lawyers told U.S. District Judge Jack McConnell that it happened because of her national origin and Hispanic name, which violated her right to equal protection under the law, among other rights.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Justice argued officials did not know she claimed to be a citizen, and her name did not turn up in a search of people who had entered the country legally, in part because she did not tell them her maiden name, under which she was granted citizenship. The state said it was trying to comply with federal law.\par \par \uc2 McConnell did not rule on any of the requests, but expressed concern about whether a U.S.-born citizen would have been deprived of her liberty under similar circumstances.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Morales is a U.S. citizen. She's been a U.S. citizen since 1995. She has a right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. It's basic constitutional law," said Kate Desormeau, of the ACLU.\par \par \uc2 Morales was detained after she was arrested Friday, May 1, 2009, by State Police for food stamps fraud. She has since pleaded no contest and is on probation.\par \par \uc2 Morales said in her lawsuit that she told state police she was born in Guatemala and is a U.S. citizen, then was taken to the state prison. State authorities also sent her name and country of birth to \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Morales was held that weekend at the state prison, then went before a judge on Monday. The judge ordered her released on personal recognizance in the state benefits fraud case, but told Morales at that time that ICE had issued an immigration detainer against her. Morales' husband offered to show her passport to prove her citizenship, but the judge said it was beyond her jurisdiction and she would have to take it up with immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit says Morales was then sent back to the state prison, strip searched and held overnight even though there was no legal reason to keep her. The following day, May 5, ICE took her into custody and released her.\par \par \uc2 Morales said that in 2004 she was also wrongly held overnight on an immigration detainer. She said an ICE official told her after the 2009 detention the same thing could happen again in the future.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the government pointed out that the name on Morales' naturalization certificate was Ada Amavilia Cabrera, and that it was her responsibility to change that when she got married. They said they have since changed their database to include her married name.\par \par \uc2 Melissa S. Leibman, a Department of Justice lawyer who represents Edward Donaghy, the ICE officer who signed the immigration detainer and sent it to Rhode Island officials, said Morales' detention was not just based on the fact that she was born in Guatemala, but also because there was no record that she entered the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the officials also argued that they had immunity from being sued because they believed there was probable cause to detain Morales.\par \par \uc2 "A reasonable officer would have believed that his conduct was lawful," Leibman said, adding later, "If there are flaws in the system, my client should not be held responsible for those flaws."\par \par \uc2 The ACLU argued that authorities ignored Morales' protests that she was a citizen. They said prisoners should immediately be told when they are under an immigration detainer and be given a way to contest them.\par \par \uc2 The judge did not say when he would rule.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130319e93j001zg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A Colorado House panel voted Monday to scrap a divisive 2006 law requiring Colorado police to report suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 The 9-2 vote came amid complaints that it isn't needed in an era of increased federal immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement officials testified that the Colorado law has been made redundant Secure Communities, a federal program that uses fingerprints collected in jails to identify illegal immigrants who have been arrested.\par \par \uc2 "In the interest of government efficiency, we should get rid of the current system," said Greenwood Village Police Chief John Jackson.\par \par \uc2 The system has been criticized for being counterproductive and creating extra paperwork. Officers say the law makes immigrants -- legal and illegal -- afraid to report crime or testify in court.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the federal law, which involves fingerprint checks, the Colorado law -- derided as a "show your papers" measure -- left state officers with little objective guidance for reporting a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "It required us to make subjective judgments on someone's immigration status, often on the basis of race, ethnicity, language skills," said Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson.\par \par \uc2 The measure had little opposition. The only person who spoke against it was illegal immigration opponent John Brick, a spokesman for the Colorado Alliance for Immigration Reform.\par \par \uc2 "Illegal immigrants commit no more crimes than those that are legal, but at the same time this is an opportunity to take those that do commit crimes and deport them," Brick said.\par \par \uc2 The measure now awaits a vote by the full House.

SMITH   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 689 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 March 2013\par 18:02\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2013.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Federal and state officials on Friday asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of a U.S. citizen who says she was illegally detained as a possible \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ada Morales, of North Providence, says her constitutional rights were violated when she was detained in 2009 for about a day at the state prison. Morales, who was born in Guatemala and became a citizen in 1995, says she told authorities she was a citizen but was held anyway. Her lawyers told U.S. District Judge Jack McConnell that it happened because of her national origin and Hispanic name, which violated her right to equal protection under the law, among other rights.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Justice argued officials did not know she claimed to be a citizen, and her name did not turn up in a search of people who had entered the country legally, in part because she did not tell them her maiden name, under which she was granted citizenship. The state said it was trying to comply with federal law.\par \par \uc2 McConnell did not rule on any of the requests, but expressed concern about whether a U.S.-born citizen would have been deprived of her liberty under similar circumstances.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Morales is a U.S. citizen. She's been a U.S. citizen since 1995. She has a right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. It's basic constitutional law," McConnell said.\par \par \uc2 Morales was detained after she was arrested Friday, May 1, 2009, by State Police for food stamps fraud. She has since pleaded no contest and is on probation.\par \par \uc2 Morales said in her lawsuit that she told state police she was born in Guatemala and is a U.S. citizen, then was taken to the state prison. State authorities also sent her name and country of birth to \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Morales was held that weekend at the state prison, then went before a judge on Monday. The judge ordered her released on personal recognizance in the state benefits fraud case, but told Morales at that time that ICE had issued an immigration detainer against her. Morales' husband offered to show her passport to prove her citizenship, but the judge said it was beyond her jurisdiction and she would have to take it up with immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit says Morales was then sent back to the state prison, strip searched and held overnight even though there was no legal reason to keep her. The following day, May 5, ICE took her into custody and released her.\par \par \uc2 Morales said that in 2004 she was also wrongly held overnight on an immigration detainer. She said an ICE official told her after the 2009 detention the same thing could happen again in the future.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the government pointed out that the name on Morales' naturalization certificate was Ada Amavilia Cabrera, and that it was her responsibility to change that when she got married. They said they have since changed their database to include her married name.\par \par \uc2 Melissa S. Leibman, a Department of Justice lawyer who represents Edward Donaghy, the ICE officer who signed the immigration detainer and sent it to Rhode Island officials, said Morales' detention was not just based on the fact that she was born in Guatemala, but also because there was no record that she entered the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the officials also argued that they had immunity from being sued because they believed there was probable cause to detain Morales.\par \par \uc2 "A reasonable officer would have believed that his conduct was lawful," Leibman said, adding later, "If there are flaws in the system, my client should not be held responsible for those flaws."\par \par \uc2 The ACLU argued that authorities ignored Morales' protests that she was a citizen. They said prisoners should immediately be told when they are under an immigration detainer and be given a way to contest them.\par \par \uc2 The judge did not say when he would rule.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130315e93f001rn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - A former Utah legislator who pushed through an immigration measure modeled after Arizona's now wants to see the law overturned in federal court.\par \par \uc2 Republican Stephen Sandstrom said this week that it would be best for the country and state to have part or all of the law tossed out, The Salt Lake Tribune reports.\par \par \uc2 "At this point, I think it would be best for this country and the state to have him go ahead and overturn it -- at least take out parts of it," Sandstrom told Tribune Wednesday after a Republican-sponsored Latino Appreciation Day at the Capitol.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom, who unsuccessfully ran for Congress last year, said he regrets pushing so hard for the measure in 2010. He said he now realizes it was the wrong approach, and that immigration enforcement should focus on illegal immigrants who have committed other crimes.\par \par \uc2 Before his change of heart, the Orem Republican spoke at anti-immigration rallies for Arizona's well-known border hawk, Russell Pearce, and sponsored, rallied and pushed for Utah's measure.\par \par \uc2 His philosophical shift was triggered by a meeting in the summer of 2011 with a 19-year-old woman who was brought illegally from Mexico by her parents as a toddler. She told him that despite good grades, she had no future without a Social Security number and no ability to work legally.\par \par \uc2 "Nothing else I'd heard from anybody shook me to the core more than that statement," Sandstrom said Wednesday. "I thought this girl who put her hand over her heart and said the Pledge of Allegiance was in every way an American, and she really is an American."\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups heard final arguments regarding the law on Feb. 15 and said that he would issue a ruling soon.\par \par \uc2 The law, HB497, was passed in 2011 but was shelved shortly thereafter for a court review.\par \par \uc2 Utah was one of several states to mirror immigration enforcement laws after Arizona's well-known measure. The key provision in Utah's law is a requirement that police check the immigration status of a person arrested for a felony or a class A misdemeanor, while giving authorities discretion to check the citizenship of those stopped for traffic infractions and other lesser offenses. Class A misdemeanors include theft, negligent homicide and criminal mischief.\par \par \uc2 The law also includes a provision making it a state crime to transport and harbor illegal immigrants. Another provision allows a "warrantless" arrest if police have reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a felony and is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has been ordered removed by an immigration judge or has been tagged for a federal immigration hold.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Salt Lake Tribune, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.sltrib.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.sltrib.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130314e93e001pa\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) - Immigrant advocacy groups have filed nearly a dozen complaints and lawsuits against \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2  across the country, claiming federal agents and officers mistreated and discriminated against illegal immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.\par \par \uc2 The groups alleged Wednesday that officers at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., were complicit in sending a 4-year-old American girl to Guatemala without giving her parents a chance to retrieve her. Officers also detained a naturalized citizen who had been working with farmworkers in New York, kept women in cold detention cells in Texas and lied on an arrest report that led to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 's detention in Washington state, the advocacy groups said.\par \par \uc2 The complaints are the latest in a series of legal actions taken against \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2  and U.S. Border Patrol from immigrant advocacy groups, who have long sought to reform the agency's conduct on the southern and northern border. The cases involve federal administrative complaints against the agency and lawsuits filed in federal court.\par \par \uc2 Some seek monetary damages.\par \par \uc2 "By filing these cases, we're aiming to send a message to CBP that it's not above the law," said Trina Realmuto of the Boston-based National Immigration Project.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2  statement said the agency can't comment on pending litigation, but adds that it stresses honor and integrity from its officers and agents.\par \par \uc2 "We do not tolerate misconduct or abuse within our ranks and we fully cooperate with all investigations of alleged unlawful conduct, on or off duty, by any of our CBP employees and contractors," the statement said.\par \par \uc2 One of the cases is that of Emily Ruiz, who at four years old was sent to Guatemala after her flight to Kennedy Airport was diverted to Dulles. The girl was traveling with her grandfather, who was denied entry because of an immigration infraction two decades earlier.\par \par \uc2 The agency said the girl's parents, who are illegal immigrants, opted to have their daughter returned to Guatemala rather than pick her up, possibly because they were concerned they would confront questions about their own residency status.\par \par \uc2 The family's attorney said the parents weren't given the chance to reunite with their daughter. It took five months for the girl to return to her home in New York. The 2011 case attracted media attention.\par \par \uc2 Another case outlined is of Lucy Rogers, a naturalized U.S. citizen who works with farmworkers in New York. Rogers said Border Patrol agents pulled her over in late 2011 without reasonable suspicion, only saying he was conducting a "citizenship checkup."\par \par \uc2 The two farmworkers traveling with her couldn't provide identification, so the agent took all three into custody. She was arrested on suspicion of trafficking people, questioned and held for several hours at the station. She alleges her car navigation device was seized for seven months.\par \par \uc2 The group also filed four complaints on behalf of illegal immigrants who were detained in Texas holding cells. They allege the cells are kept at cold temperatures, don't have enough beds or bathrooms and aren't sometimes given cups to drink tap water. They allege some of the immigrants were in the holding cells for as long as six days.\par \par \uc2 In another case in Texas, an American woman crossing the border in Brownsville in late 2012 was forcibly thrown on the ground and injured by an agent during a search. The woman, Laura Mireles, was treated by paramedics for her injuries and released without being charged, the complaint alleges.\par \par \uc2 In Washington state, Gustavo Vargas Ramirez is suing the agency because he alleges a Border Patrol agent lied on his report to justify his arrest.\par \par \uc2 In that case, an Anacortes, Wash., police officer pulled the man over for a traffic infraction in 2011. The police officer called Border Patrol during the stop and an agent instructed the officer to put Vargas Ramirez on the phone. The man declined to answer any questions over the phone unless an attorney was present. The agent then instructed the police officer to arrest Vargas Ramirez because there weren't any records he was a legal resident, the complaint said.\par \par \uc2 Attorneys for Vargas Ramirez said the Border Patrol agent then said he was at the scene of the arrest and that he was called to provide language interpretation, even though the officer and Vargas Ramirez communicated without trouble. The complaint alleges that the police report filed by the officer who pulled Vargas Ramirez contradicts the Border Patrol report.\par \par \uc2 "Whether someone is a citizen or non-citizen, doesn't give the Border Patrol any legal justification to unlawfully arrest someone or beat them up. The constitution and laws govern all folks, not just those with legal immigration status," said \uc2 Matt Adams\uc2  of the Seattle-based Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. He is representing Vargas Ramirez.\par \par \uc2 Representatives of the National Border Patrol Council did not immediately return a message Thursday seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 Previously, union vice president Shawn Moran had said "interest" group activism against the Border Patrol is taking a toll on the morale of agents and that Border Patrol agents don't target specific types of people, except those violating the nation's immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130313e93d0027v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

"It turned into a couple of wild male elk in mating season locking horns -- except for one party, the horns were a knife."\par \par \uc2 Authorities have placed a hold on Ramirez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and they could start deportation proceedings when he is released.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130312e93c0028h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - The cheers of immigrant students echoed through the Colorado Capitol on Friday after the House passed a bill allowing students who entered the U.S. illegally to pay lower college tuition, a measure that will soon become law.\par \par \uc2 Students hugged and wiped away tears outside the House chamber after the vote, sending the proposal to Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is expected to sign it sometime this month.\par \par \uc2 The historic vote comes a decade after the bill was first introduced. Along the way, Colorado lawmakers grappled with immigration and passed strict enforcement laws, including one to deny non-emergency benefits to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Colorado Republicans have traditionally taken a tough stand on illegal immigration, but this year a few joined Democrats in the House and Senate who unanimously supported the bill. Three House Republicans voted yes, including Rep. Kevin Priola.\par \par \uc2 "Thank you, Rep. Priola!" the students yelled outside after the vote.\par \par \uc2 "For all intents and purposes Colorado is their home state, and there is no country to go back to. They're bright, energetic hardworking kids," Priola said.\par \par \uc2 The bill would allow students who graduate from Colorado high schools to attend college at the in-state rate, regardless of their immigration status. Currently, students in the country illegally must pay the nonresident tuition rate, which can be more than three times higher than the in-state rate.\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 National Conference of State Legislatures\uc2 , 12 other states have passed laws to allow illegal immigrants to attend college at in-state rates, including conservative strongholds such as Texas and Utah.\par \par \uc2 Similar bills have been debated in Colorado for a decade, with both parties voting to defeat the proposals.\par \par \uc2 "This is history, you know?" said Victor Galvan, 22, a student at Metropolitan State University of Denver who was hugging other students outside the House chamber in celebration. "For 10 long years we fought."\par \par \uc2 Later, downstairs from the House, students gathered in a circle with Democratic Sen. \uc2 Mike Johnston\uc2 , who has been pushing for the bill for three years. Some students took turns trading stories about being unable to afford college. Galvan recalled how his mother told him it would be OK if he didn't go to college.\par \par \uc2 "Never again will another person have to say that to their son or daughter. I told her that I would graduate from high school and I would give her one day my college diploma," he said, choking up.\par \par \uc2 Jennifer Romero, 21, said she finished high school in 2009 but was short $200 to attend her first semester at a community college.\par \par \uc2 "And ever since then, I've been waiting, just waiting, just saving up," she said. "And now we know that that's not going to happen again, that I can go out there and give them money, pay in-state tuition and be able to graduate."\par \par \uc2 In previous years, Johnston had gathered the students in a circle to console them about the bill's failure.\par \par \uc2 "It's the best day I've ever spent in this building," he said.\par \par \uc2 Johnston said "there's a changing sentiment" about immigration in Colorado, and he credited the tuition bill.\par \par \uc2 "I think this debate has changed how the state sees this issue, and I think it will have reverberations beyond this issue," he said.\par \par \uc2 Most in the GOP still opposed the tuition measure. But during debates they took pains to argue they aren't anti-Latino, but critical of an overall immigration system that is flawed. They argued that a federal immigration overhaul needs to happen first, and said the bill would give students false hope because they would be saddled with college debt, but unable to get a job because of their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "And I just don't see how that provides a brighter future," said Republican Rep. Polly Lawrence.\par \par \uc2 But Democrats disagreed. The immigrant students who get in-state tuition will have to sign an affidavit saying they're pursuing citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "Please be on the right side of history because this is not about false hope," Rep. Angela Williams, a Democrat from Denver, told her colleagues before the vote.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Find Ivan Moreno at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/IvanJourno"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/IvanJourno}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130308e938001v1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

John Hickenlooper, who is expected to sign it.\par \par \uc2 Three Republicans joined with all the Democrats in voting for the bill Friday.\par \par \uc2 The bill would allow students who graduate from Colorado high schools attend college at the in-state rate regardless of their immigration status. Currently, students in the country illegally must pay the nonresident tuition rate, which can be more than three times higher than the in-state rate.\par \par \uc2 Similar bills have been debated in Colorado for a decade. Both parties have voted to defeat the proposals in the past.\par \par \uc2 Republicans argued that a federal immigration overhaul needs to happen before the bill.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130308e9380010e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A hotelier's widow who had been accused of cheating an Indian household servant out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in salary and keeping her a virtual prisoner at a mansion was found guilty Friday of knowingly keeping the woman in the country illegally but won't have to pay her.\par \par \uc2 Annie George, whose husband died in a plane crash, had said she didn't know Valsamma Mathai was in the United States illegally. She also said she didn't mistreat Mathai during the 5 1/2 years she worked in her 20,000-square-foot home in suburban Rexford, near Albany.\par \par \uc2 Mathai had testified that she slept in a closet, worked long days without vacation, days off or sick time and wasn't allowed to leave the palatial stone mansion on a cliff overlooking the Mohawk River.\par \par \uc2 Federal prosecutors had said George owed Mathai $317,000, based on the minimum wage and overtime for the hours she worked. Mathai said she was paid only $26,000, much of which she sent to her family in India.\par \par \uc2 But because the jury didn't find George guilty of keeping Mathai for financial gain, the original charge, she won't be liable for the wages, said George's lawyer, Mark Sacco.\par \par \uc2 George, 40, was convicted of harboring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . She faces a penalty of up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine at her July 9 sentencing. She remains free on bail.\par \par \uc2 George did not answer questions as she left the court, but Sacco said she was devastated. She's now left trying to raise five children and maintain a struggling business.\par \par \uc2 Sacco noted the jury did not convict her of the more severe charge.\par \par \uc2 "I think, in many ways, Annie feels vindicated because what a lot of the reports were was that she mistreated this woman and mistreated this woman like a slave," Sacco said. "None of that was true."\par \par \uc2 The case surfaced when one of Mathai's sons in India, Shiju Mathai, called the National Human Trafficking Resources Center in 2011.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, George said a tape recording of a phone call between a woman and Shiju Mathai, which prosecutors played Wednesday, wasn't her voice. She didn't say who she thought the voice belonged to.\par \par \uc2 On the call, the woman warns Shiju Mathai there could be dire consequences, even jail time, for his mother if she were to tell authorities about working in the United States.\par \par \uc2 George testified that she was left in desperate financial straits when her husband died in 2009. She said she knew nothing of his business dealings, including the arrangement to have Valsamma Mathai live with them, because he required her to stick to her duties as his wife and mother of their six children and severely punished her if she tried to make any decisions in the home.\par \par \uc2 Her late husband, Mathai George, was a native of India who built a hotel and real estate development business in the United States. He was killed along with his 11-year-old son and another man when their private plane crashed after takeoff.\par \par \uc2 Sacco, in closing arguments, said Annie George deferred to her husband on all decisions.\par \par \uc2 "The government is prosecuting Annie George because Mathai George isn't here," Sacco said.\par \par \uc2 He suggested Shiju Mathai launched the investigation because he was unhappy that his mother was sending less money home after Mathai George died.\par \par \uc2 But Assistant U.S. Attorney Rick Belliss said Annie George was an intelligent woman with a graduate degree in pharmacy who, even if she didn't directly know Valsamma Mathai's immigration status, was smart enough to figure it out.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors had no immediate comment after Friday's verdict.\par \par \uc2 Valsamma Mathai, who was not in court Friday, came to the United States legally on a visa and stayed with another family after her husband died of cancer, leaving her the sole provider for her two sons and ailing mother. When she left that family her status was illegal because it violated the terms of the visa, Belliss said.\par \par \uc2 A business associate testified Wednesday that Mathai George left six hotels, all in foreclosure or bankrupt and in poor condition. Several friends of Annie George said when they visited it appeared Valsamma Mathai was a member of the family, rather than a servant, and George's children called her grandmother.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130308e938000t3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Belliss said Annie George even took Valsamma to an immigration lawyer once, a charge George denies.\par \par \uc2 Valsamma Mathai came to the United States legally on a visa after her husband died of cancer, leaving her the sole provider for her two sons and ailing mother. When she left the original family she was illegal because it violated the terms of the visa, Belliss said.\par \par \uc2 A business associate testified Wednesday that Mathai George left six hotels, all in foreclosure or bankrupt and in poor condition. Several friends of Annie George said when they visited it appeared Valsamma Mathai was a member of the family rather than a servant, and George's children called her grandmother.\par \par \uc2 Federal prosecutors said Annie George owes Mathai $317,000, based on the minimum wage and overtime for the hours she worked in the George household. Mathai said she was paid only $26,000, much of which she sent to her family in India.\par \par \uc2 Closing arguments at the Albany trial are expected to begin Thursday.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130307e937000p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) - The governor of Puerto Rico on Thursday endorsed a proposal that would allow illegal immigrants living in the U.S. territory to apply for a provisional driver's license.\par \par \uc2 The license would be granted only to those who have lived in Puerto Rico for a year and have either a passport or an embassy-issued document proving their identity.\par \par \uc2 If approved, Puerto Rico would join a handful of U.S. states that grant driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla announced he would submit his proposal to the island's legislature, saying that Puerto Rico should stop ignoring its immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 "Their contributions to the country and respect for human dignity make them worthy of certain fundamental protections on behalf of the state," Garcia said.\par \par \uc2 An estimated more than 150,000 immigrants from the Dominican Republic live in Puerto Rico, the majority in the capital of San Juan, along with thousands of other Caribbean immigrants, mostly from Haiti.\par \par \uc2 Human rights groups applauded the governor's announcement, saying it was long overdue.\par \par \uc2 "All immigrants are going to benefit from this," said Jose Rodriguez, president of the Dominican Committee for Human Rights.\par \par \uc2 Rodriguez said the provisional licenses would also boost the island's struggling economy.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to create millions of dollars in revenue ... when all these immigrants get their license, obtain their car registration and buy a car," he said.\par \par \uc2 Garcia's party controls both the island's House and Senate, and legislators are expected to approve the proposal.\par \par \uc2 If approved, illegal migrants would have to renew their license every three years, compared with six years for a regular license. The provisional driving license would have a different design and state clearly that federal officials cannot accept it as a form of identification or for any other purpose. It would not explicitly say that its holder is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "A person's immigration status is completely irrelevant when it comes to their ability to drive," the proposal states.\par \par \uc2 If the proposal is approved, the law would go into effect a year later.\par \par \uc2 Currently, New Mexico and Washington state allow illegal immigrants to apply for the same driver's license as a U.S. citizen. Utah issues a special driving permit that cannot be used for identification.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130307e937001ty\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - As student activists looked on, a plan to reduce tuition rates for illegal immigrants who grew up in Colorado advanced in the state House on Tuesday, marking a legislative milestone and a significant shift in political opinion.\par \par \uc2 After debate that was at times testy and emotional, the bill moved to within one step of Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is expected to sign the legislation when it reaches his desk.\par \par \uc2 After the debate, 22-year-old Victor Galvan was near tears as he told students around him that he "never would've thought we'd be seeing this in this chamber."\par \par \uc2 "I'm so proud of you guys, to keep fighting," said Galvan, who's family came to the U.S. from the Mexican state of Chihuahua when he was 8-months-old. Galvan currently pays out-of-state tuition rates, which are three times more expensive than in-state rates.\par \par \uc2 The bill, which already has passed the state Senate and gained initial House approval on a voice vote Tuesday, allows students who graduate from Colorado high schools to pay tuition at state resident rates, regardless of immigration status.\par \par \uc2 The bill's advance this year marks the furthest it has gone in the legislative process in Colorado. Such proposals have been debated in the state for a decade, but both parties have defeated the measures.\par \par \uc2 At least 13 other states have passed laws to allow illegal immigrants to attend college at in-state rates, including conservative strongholds such as Texas and Utah.\par \par \uc2 In Colorado in recent years, bills have cleared the Democratic-led Senate, but stalled in the House, where Republicans held the majority.\par \par \uc2 Democrats now control both chambers, and a handful of Republicans have joined in support of the legislation.\par \par \uc2 "There are lives at stake, and futures at stake," said Brighton Republican Rep. Kevin Priola.\par \par \uc2 Other Republicans argue that the proposal violates a 2006 state law -- passed with Democrats in control -- that forbids nonemergency benefits from going to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Republicans proposed amending the bill to refer it to voters, and said they should decide whether tax dollars should be used to benefit illegal immigrants who would pay lower tuition. The amendment failed, but the discussion prompted one of the more heated exchanges when Democratic Rep. Crisanta Duran, the bill sponsor, addressed her colleagues on the House floor.\par \par \uc2 "I'm frustrated, there is just an arrogance ..." she said, before being interrupted by howls of protest from Republicans. "I am hearing arguments, as though only people who can vote in elections are the only people who pay taxes in this country. Really?"\par \par \uc2 Republicans said college should be more affordable to all students.\par \par \uc2 "The issue I have is, we are creating a special group discount, so let's not do that," said Republican Rep. Jerry Sonnenberg.\par \par \uc2 Galvan said he watched Colorado lawmakers defeat the bill in 2009, the year he graduated high school. He went to a community college for a year.\par \par \uc2 "I spent all my money," he said, adding that he's been attending classes off-and-on since then. He recalls the debate in 2009 as being "hard to listen to."\par \par \uc2 "The way that they emphasized \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and illegal aliens, I mean really talking to students about students in that way," he said, adding that he's seen a complete turnaround in the dialogue around immigration.\par \par \uc2 "It's just amazing how far we've come," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Find Ivan Moreno Twitter: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/IvanJourno"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/IvanJourno}}}\par \par \uc2 Read the bill: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://goo.gl/D9OJR"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://goo.gl/D9OJR}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130305e935000ox\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

BECK   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 476 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 March 2013\par 17:16\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2013.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PAPILLION, Neb. (AP) - A Nebraska civil rights group is suing Sarpy County in eastern Nebraska on behalf of a man who says he was unjustly jailed for four days because sheriff's deputies wrongly suspected he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Nebraska chapter of the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  filed the lawsuit Thursday in Sarpy County District Court. The group said in a news release Friday that Ramon Mendoza, 48, of Papillion, was jailed in March 2010 after he was pulled over by a sheriff's deputy for an object obstructing his view -- his son's boxing medal hanging from the rear-view mirror. Deputies arrested him upon finding he did not have a valid driver's license or proof of car insurance -- both misdemeanors.\par \par \uc2 Once at the jail, the lawsuit says, he was not allowed to call his family or a lawyer, and was held while deputies sought information from federal immigration officials on whether Mendoza was in the country illegally. Mendoza was not given an opportunity to bond out of jail, the lawsuit says.\par \par \uc2 Mendoza is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Mexico. The lawsuit says he gave deputies his name, address and Social Security number, and that law enforcement officials repeatedly turned away Mendoza's wife and son when they tried to present Mendoza's naturalization certificate, Social Security card and other documents to prove his citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit also says jail staff repeatedly addressed Mendoza using racial slurs and that one official showed him a picture of a swastika.\par \par \uc2 Mendoza was released only after Sarpy County officials received a fax from federal immigration officials saying they had no reason to detain Mendoza -- four days after Mendoza was jailed, according to the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 "Without any legal authority whatsoever, Sarpy County imprisoned our client for four days with no opportunity to seek counsel and no opportunity to post bail all because they thought he was an illegal alien," said Omaha attorney Denise Frost, who also is representing Mendoza in the lawsuit. "Our fundamental constitutional values prohibit depriving any person of liberty without due process of law."\par \par \uc2 Upon his release, the lawsuit says Mendoza's wife took him to a hospital, where he was treated for dehydration and emotional distress.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit, which also names \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  as a defendant, seeks $10,000 in special damages, as well as other damages for an unspecified amount.\par \par \uc2 Neither Sarpy County Sheriff Jeff Davis nor Sarpy County Attorney Lee Polikov could be reached Saturday for comment.\par \par \uc2 "Police officers and jailers are always required to obey the constitution," said Amy Miller, legal director for ACLU Nebraska. "They simply cannot imprison a person in this way, even if an immigration detainer exists."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130302e932002ve\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

CALDWELL   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 639 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 February 2013\par 18:18\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2013.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The senior Homeland Security Department official in charge of arresting and deporting illegal immigrants announced his retirement the same day the agency said that hundreds of people facing deportation had been released from immigration jails due to looming budget cuts, according to a letter obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press. The government said he had told his bosses weeks ago that he planned to retire.\par \par \uc2 Gary Mead\uc2 , executive associate director over enforcement and removal operations at Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, disclosed his departure in an email to his staff Tuesday afternoon. The announcement of the release of the illegal immigrants had come earlier in the day.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's spokesman, \uc2 Jay Carney\uc2 , said Wednesday that the decision to release the immigrants was made without any input from the White House. He described the immigrants as "low-risk, non-criminal detainees."\par \par \uc2 The announcement that a few hundred illegal immigrants were being released was among the most significant and direct implications described so far by the Obama administration about the pending, automatic budget cuts that will take effect later this week under what is known as sequestration.\par \par \uc2 Republicans in Congress quickly criticized the decision and pressed the Homeland Security Department for details.\par \par \uc2 In an email to his staff obtained by the AP, Mead said he was leaving the agency at the end of April "with mixed emotions." He did not say what prompted his departure. Mead did not immediately respond to an email and a telephone call.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the agency, Gillian Christensen, said there was no connection between Mead's announcement to his staff and the decision to release the illegal immigrants. She said Mead had told senior leaders in the agency several weeks ago that he planned to retire.\par \par \uc2 Mead said Tom Homan will succeed him as acting executive associate director.\par \par \uc2 At the White House, Carney said the decision to release what he described as "a few hundred" of the 30,000 illegal immigrants in federal detention was made by "career officials" at the immigration agency. He said the immigrants who were released were still subject to deportation.\par \par \uc2 "All of these individuals remain in removal proceedings," Carney said. "Priority for detention remains on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety."\par \par \uc2 ICE is required by Congress to maintain 34,000 immigration jail beds. As of last week, the agency held an average daily population of 30,733 in its jails.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Janet Napolitano\uc2  warned this week that DHS might not be able to afford to maintain those 34,000 jail beds and that mandatory budget cuts would hurt the department's core missions.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think we can maintain the same level of security at all places around the country with sequester as without sequester," said Napolitano, adding that the impact would be "like a rolling ball. It will keep growing."\par \par \uc2 According to the National Immigration Forum, it costs the government about $164 a day to keep an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  facing deportation jailed. In a report on immigration detention costs last year, the advocacy group said costs for supervised release can range from about 30 cents to $14 a day.\par \par \uc2 Republican lawmakers have decried the jail releases. The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter Wednesday to ICE Director John Morton asking who was released and what was being done to keep track of them.\par \par \uc2 "This decision reflects the lack of resource prioritization within the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement and is indicative of the department's weak stance on national security," McCaul wrote.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Alicia A.

CALDWELL   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 437 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 February 2013\par 17:36\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2013.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - A week before mandatory budget cuts go into effect across the government, the Department of Homeland Security has started releasing illegal immigrants being held in immigration jails across the country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Gillian Christensen, an ICE spokeswoman, said ICE has reviewed "several hundred cases" of immigrants being held in jails around the country and released them in the last week. They have been "placed on an appropriate, more cost-effective form of supervised release," she said.\par \par \uc2 Christensen said the agency's "priority for detention remains on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety." She did not say how released immigrants were selected or what jails they were released from.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday's announcement of jail releases is the first tangible impact of the looming budget cuts for DHS.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration has been issuing dire warnings about the impact of the sequestration and DHS Secretary \uc2 Janet Napolitano\uc2  told reporters at the White House Monday that across-the-board cuts would impact the department's core operations, including border security and airport screening operations.\par \par \uc2 She also warned that DHS might not be able to afford to keep the 34,000 immigration jail beds mandated by Congress. On average last week, there were 30,773 people being held in ICE jails.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think we can maintain the same level of security at all places around the country with sequester as without sequester," said Napolitano, adding that the impact would be "`like a rolling ball. It will keep growing."\par \par \uc2 According to the National Immigration Forum, it costs the government about $164 a day to keep an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  facing deportation jailed. In a report on immigration detention costs last year the advocacy group said costs for supervised release can range from about 30 cents to $14 a day.\par \par \uc2 Republicans lawmakers decried the releases Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 "It's abhorrent that President (Barack) Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte. "By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the Administration is needlessly endangering American lives. It also undermines our efforts to come together with the Administration and reform our nation's immigration laws."\par \par \uc2 The administration asked for about $1.96 billion for immigration jail operations in the last budget. It amounts to about $5.4 million a day, according to the National Immigration Forum's report.\par \par \uc2 Christensen said Tuesday that released immigrants will still face deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130226e92q001ig\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOISE, Idaho (AP) - In Idaho, Little Bo Peep better keep up with her sheep.\par \par \uc2 The livestock industry wants a new law, to charge shepherds who abandon their animals on the open range or in the lambing sheds with a misdemeanor crime.\par \par \uc2 The Senate State Affairs Committee agreed to introduce the bill Monday, to punish sheepherders who go on the lam with up to a $1,000 fine and a year in jail. Helping somebody to leave their sheep would merit the same treatment, under the bill.\par \par \uc2 Idaho's sheep industry has a long history of employing foreign workers to herd its animals, starting with Basque immigrants from Spain a century ago. Now, ranchers often rely on shepherds from Peru who live in rugged circumstances in Idaho's deserts or mountains to watch over flocks and keep them safe from predators, lightning strikes and even feral dogs.\par \par \uc2 The problem now, Idaho Wool Growers Association director \uc2 Stan Boyd\uc2  told the panel, is foreign workers who arrive legally on visas are often enticed to leave their jobs suddenly and without warning to ranchers for more-lucrative, less-isolated work at nurseries or in landscaping.\par \par \uc2 Though such a flight may already result in them becoming an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Boyd argues Idaho should pass additional laws to further induce shepherds into sticking it out -- and to keep them from fleecing ranchers.\par \par \uc2 "In the middle of the night, maybe three months later, they walk off, abandon the sheep, or if they're in the lambing sheds they abandon their duties," Boyd said, adding ranchers often spend between $2,500 to $3,000, including for airfare, for foreign workers to come to the U.S. to work on federal H-2A visas for three-year periods.\par \par \uc2 "What we'd like to do is simply put in place where it's a misdemeanor if that man jumps his contract without proper notification to the employer," Boyd added. "We're just asking folks to finish their contract. Or if they don't like it, they can always be transferred to another operation, or they can go home."\par \par \uc2 Contacted Monday, Deanne Amaden, a spokeswoman in San Francisco for the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division that helps enforce laws governing H-2A visas, wasn't immediately aware of whether agriculture operations like sheep ranches can seek to recover money from foreign workers who don't fulfill terms of their contracts.\par \par \uc2 Boyd said that's not standard practice, although some workers who are in the United States for only a short duration before deciding to go back home must pay for their return flight.\par \par \uc2 The bill is now due a full hearing, after Monday's introduction.\par \par \uc2 Even so, some members of the Senate panel voiced initial skepticism that leaving a job without proper notice should be enough to turn a person into a criminal.\par \par \uc2 "Is there another job description in Idaho where quitting your job results in a misdemeanor?" Sen. Elliot Werk, a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat from Boise.\par \par \uc2 Boyd said he wasn't aware of any.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130225e92p002ha\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Following a passionate and sometimes heated debate, the Oregon House approved a bill Friday that would extend resident college tuition rates to some young illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 After the vote count showed the bill had passed, supporters watching in the gallery stood up and, holding hands, raised their arms in celebration.\par \par \uc2 "When I saw those numbers I was very excited," said Hugo Nicolas, 20, who said he entered the country illegally when he was 11. He wants to attend the \uc2 University of Oregon\uc2  to study economics and minor in Chinese.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Michael Dembrow, a Portland Democrat who sponsored the measure, called it a "historic" vote, an important educational and economic step for Oregon.\par \par \uc2 The House's 38-18 vote sends the measure to the Senate. In the last decade, similar legislation has failed twice in the House after passing the Senate in 2003 and 2011. This time, five Republicans supported it.\par \par \uc2 On a national level, Republicans have been under pressure to increase their appeal to Latino voters since \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  lost the presidential election.\par \par \uc2 The bill is strongly supported by Gov. John Kitzhaber and Senate President Peter Courtney, both Democrats.\par \par \uc2 "I applaud the House for its bipartisan vote in support of House Bill 2787, which provides tuition equity for all Oregonians," Kitzhaber said in a written statement.\par \par \uc2 The measure would allow students to qualify for in-state tuition at Oregon's seven public universities if they've attended an Oregon high school for at least three years and lived in the United States for at least five. They'd also have to sign an affidavit swearing they'll apply to legalize their immigration status as soon as they are eligible.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would not be eligible for state or federal financial aid, and they'd be subject to the same university entrance requirements as other applicants.\par \par \uc2 Republicans offered a counterproposal that would have made the bill expire in 2016 and limited the resident tuition rates to students in the country by July 1. It also would have provided more stringent rules on how students would follow through with their pledge to become lawful residents. It was rejected in a party-line vote.\par \par \uc2 After it failed, Republican Rep. Jason Conger, of Bend, said the House missed an opportunity to adopt a measure with overwhelming bipartisan support. Conger sparred with Democratic Speaker Tina Kotek, of Portland, who interrupted his speech numerous times to ask that he stay on point.\par \par \uc2 Visibly upset, Conger told the speaker, "I will want to have a follow-up discussion about the stifling of my voice."\par \par \uc2 The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Office estimated the bill would increase the state's revenue by $335,000 over the next two years and by an additional $1.6 million between 2015 and 2017.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Oregon University\uc2  System estimated 38 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students would take advantage of the resident tuition rates during the next two years and 80 more students would take part in the two years after that.\par \par \uc2 The difference between resident and nonresident tuition is almost $20,000. At the \uc2 University of Oregon\uc2 , resident tuition fees for 15 credits, the average course load, are $9,310 per year.\par \par \uc2 "I know that this historic vote is really the result of larger historic forces that are at play," Dembrow said, referencing President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's promise to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Portland State University student Victor Mena, an advocate of the bill who became a legal U.S. resident last year, said he sees this as a step toward improving the opportunities for young illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 During the debate, Dembrow referred to Mena as an example of why the state should invest in its young \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population.\par \par \uc2 Mena, a criminal justice major and Persian language minor, said he wants to be an FBI agent after he graduates.\par \par \uc2 "When I was growing up I watched law enforcement interact with my community and I think that I have a lot to teach, in a way, on how to communicate with other communities and cultures," Mena said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130223e92n00023\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - Nine in 10 California voters say they support allowing illegal immigrants who have been in the country for several years to stay and become citizens if they have a job, learn English and pay any back taxes they may owe, according to a Field Poll released Friday.\par \par \uc2 The poll, which comes as Congress prepares to debate federal immigration reform, also found that a majority of voters support allowing residents who are in the U.S. illegally to get California driver's licenses, a reversal from previous surveys.\par \par \uc2 Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas, has proposed legislation this year that would allow the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue licenses to any resident who can show they pay taxes, regardless of their immigration status. Former state Sen. Gil Cedillo, a Democrat, tried for more than a decade to make such a change, but his efforts either did not make it through the Legislature or were vetoed by previous governors.\par \par \uc2 The Legislature took a partial step last year when Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill by Cedillo that allows some young illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. Those immigrants would have to be eligible for work permits under a new federal deferred-action policy.\par \par \uc2 While the poll found voters support loosening restrictions on some illegal immigrants, it also found that two-thirds favor boosting the number of federal agents patrolling the border with Mexico. Most also support stringent penalties for employers who hire illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 Three-quarters of those surveyed said they supported adding significantly more visas for immigrants with engineering or other advanced degrees, creating temporary worker programs and allowing illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition for college as they do if they attend for three years and graduate from a California high school.\par \par \uc2 Under a law that took effect this year, low-income \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who graduate from a California high school are eligible to receive Cal Grants to attend college and may apply for fee waivers in the community college system if they show they are in the process of applying to become legal residents.\par \par \uc2 Congress is in the midst of bipartisan negotiations over immigration reform, and the Obama administration is drafting backup legislation as a way to prompt action on the issue.\par \par \uc2 The debate in Washington is likely to include providing a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the U.S., tightening border security, cracking down on businesses that employ illegal workers and strengthening the legal immigration system.\par \par \uc2 The Field Poll interviewed 834 registered voters by telephone Feb. 5-17. The poll has a sampling error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130222e92m002j5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Oregon House lawmakers voted Friday to pass a bill that would extend resident college tuition rates to some young illegal immigrants following a passionate -- and at moments heated -- hour-long debate.\par \par \uc2 After the numbers showed the bill had passed, supporters watching in the gallery stood up and, holding hands, raised their arms in celebration.\par \par \uc2 "When I saw those numbers I was very excited," said Hugo Nicolas, 20, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who wants to attend the \uc2 University of Oregon\uc2  to study economics.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Michael Dembrow, a Portland Democrat who sponsored the measure, called it a "historic" vote, an important educational and economic step for Oregon.\par \par \uc2 The House's 38-18 vote sends the measure to the Senate. In the last decade, similar legislation has failed twice in the House after passing the Senate in 2003 and 2011. Both died in the House without a vote amid Republican opposition. This time five Republicans supported it.\par \par \uc2 The measure would allow students to qualify for in-state tuition at Oregon's seven public universities if they've attended an Oregon high school for at least three years and lived in the United States for at least five. They'd also have to sign an affidavit swearing they'll apply to legalize their immigration status as soon as they are eligible.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would not be eligible for state or federal financial aid, and they'd be subject to the same university entrance requirements as other applicants.\par \par \uc2 Republicans offered a counter proposal that would have made the bill expire in 2016 and limited the resident tuition rates to students in the country by July 1. It also would have provided more stringent rules on how students would follow through with their pledge to become lawful residents. It was rejected in a party-line vote.\par \par \uc2 The non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Office estimated the bill would increase the state's revenue by $335,000 over the next two years and by an additional $1.6 million between 2015 and 2017.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Oregon University\uc2  System estimated 38 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 -students would take advantage of the resident tuition rates during the next two years and 80 more students would take part in the two years after that.\par \par \uc2 The difference between resident and nonresident tuition is almost $20,000. At the \uc2 University of Oregon\uc2 , resident tuition fees for 15 credits, the average course load, are currently $9,310 per year.\par \par \uc2 "I know that this historic vote is really the result of larger historic forces that are at play," Dembrow said, referencing President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's promise to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130222e92m001sd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Lawyers for the man convicted of killing Washington intern Chandra Levy said in documents unsealed Tuesday that his prosecution was "predicated on a lie," and that they intend to file a motion for a new trial.\par \par \uc2 The statements made by attorneys for Ingmar Guandique were included in approximately 200 pages of documents related to hearings held in December and January. Reporters and the public were not permitted to hear the discussion between the judge and lawyers because prosecutors argued that making the hearings open would endanger a witness.\par \par \uc2 The decision to close the proceedings was challenged by media organizations including The Associated Press. The judge in the case said some material would be unsealed.\par \par \uc2 The records show that government prosecutors asked to seal the Dec. 18 hearing to talk about information they learned about after Guandique was sentenced. Defense attorneys say the information calls into question the testimony of one witness and "drastically undercut" the government's case.\par \par \uc2 More than 20 witnesses testified for the prosecution during the trial. The original case hinged on a jailhouse informant who said Guandique had confessed to killing Levy. The unsealed documents show prosecutors learned a year ago about a problem with a witness but it's not clear if that person was the informant.\par \par \uc2 The Levy case was one of the most high-profile trials in Washington in years when it began in 2010. Levy, a 24-year-old intern for the \uc2 U.S. Bureau of Prisons\uc2 , disappeared in 2001 after leaving her apartment in jogging clothes.\par \par \uc2 The case attracted particular attention because of her romantic relationship with Gary Condit, then a California congressman. Her remains were found in 2002 in a heavily wooded area of Washington's Rock Creek Park. Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, was ultimately convicted of her murder and is serving a 60-year prison sentence. He said when he was sentenced that he had nothing to do with her killing.\par \par \uc2 The documents unsealed Tuesday include transcripts from hearings on Dec. 18 and Jan. 4. They also include court documents filed by prosecutors and Guandique's defense attorneys. Significant portions of the records are blacked out, sometimes for pages.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. Guandique and the public have a right to know precisely what happened at Mr. Guandique's trial and why the government allowed its prosecution to be predicated on a lie," Guandique's attorneys argue in a motion unsealed Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 A transcript also shows \uc2 John Anderson\uc2 , one of Guandique's attorneys, said during the January hearing that the defense plans to file a motion to dismiss the indictment and request a new trial.\par \par \uc2 In a document filed with the court, defense attorneys compare the Guandique case to the prosecution of the late Sen. \uc2 Ted Stevens\uc2  of Alaska, whose 2008 conviction on corruption charges was vacated after the Justice Department admitted withholding evidence from the defense.\par \par \uc2 It wasn't clear, however, that the new information would have been admissible at trial. The unsealed transcripts seem to show that during the hearing in December, a government prosecutor, Fernando Campoamor, told the judge "it would have been litigated whether it could have been used at trial, and if so, to what extent it could have been used at trial." A defense attorney, James Klein, said that was "astounding."\par \par \uc2 The transcripts also show attorneys wrestling with the closure of the proceedings. The defense had wanted them to be open, but the judge sealed the hearings after prosecutors argued that a witness' personal safety would be endangered if they were public. The defense has said prosecutors were not specific about the threats the witness would face.\par \par \uc2 The last hearing in the case was Thursday and its transcript was not released. The judge has scheduled another hearing for April 11.\par \par \uc2 ------------\par \par \uc2 Follow Jessica Gresko at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/jessicagresko"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/jessicagresko}}}\uc2  and Ben Nuckols at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130219e92j002zs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2 's split ruling on Arizona's immigration enforcement law last summer shows that a similar law in Utah should be ruled unconstitutional, argued critics of the 2-year-old law that has yet to be implemented.\par \par \uc2 An \uc2 U.S. Department of Justice\uc2  lawyer and a team of private attorneys made that argument Friday during a hearing before U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups in Salt Lake City. They urged Waddoups to permanently strike down the Utah law.\par \par \uc2 Assistant Attorney General Philip Lott countered that the key provisions in the state's law are "night and day" different from Arizona's measures that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  blocked in June. The high court upheld Arizona's section that requires police to check the status of people they suspect are in the country illegally, which Lott said bodes well for a similar one in Utah's law. He asked Waddoups to allow Utah's law to go into effect.\par \par \uc2 The law, HB497, was passed in 2011 but was shelved shortly thereafter for a court review. Friday's hearing was the first on the law since February 2012, when Waddoups announced he would wait until after the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  weighed in on Arizona's law to take up the issue.\par \par \uc2 Utah was one of several states around the country to mirror immigration enforcement laws after Arizona's well-known measure. The key provision in Utah's law is a requirement that police check the immigration status of a person arrested for a felony or a class A misdemeanor, while giving authorities discretion to check the citizenship of those stopped for traffic infractions and other lesser offenses. Class A misdemeanors include theft, negligent homicide and criminal mischief.\par \par \uc2 The law also includes a provision making it a state crime to transport and harbor illegal immigrants. Another provision allows a "warrantless" arrest if police have reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a felony and is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has been ordered removed by an immigration judge or has been tagged for a federal immigration hold.\par \par \uc2 During Friday's 1 1/2-hour hearing, Waddoups asked dozens of questions to attorneys on both sides about several different provisions in the law. At the conclusion, he told them he'd issue a ruling soon.\par \par \uc2 Waddoups questioned Utah's lawyers several times about the overarching purpose of different provisions in the law -- asking if certain measures were necessary and any different than what already takes place daily.\par \par \uc2 Lott said the law clarifies Utah's role in cooperating with the federal government on immigration enforcement. He also pointed to guidance issued by former Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff on how to enforce the law as evidence that police won't overstep their bounds.\par \par \uc2 But the judge questioned if that guidance from Shurtleff would have any legal binding in relation to the review of the law's constitutionality. The \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2 's lawyer, Scott Simpson, said it wouldn't because it could be altered or scrapped by the new attorney general.\par \par \uc2 The hearing pitted Lott and one other state attorney against a team of lawyers arguing the law should be struck down. That side included Simpson, \uc2 Karen Tumlin\uc2  of the \uc2 National Immigration Law Center\uc2 , and Jennifer Chang Newell of the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Simpson said the federal government concedes that one section of Utah's law is constitutional: a provision that would allow police officers to transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to a federal facility. Tumlin and Chang Newell, however, argued that entire law should be struck down.\par \par \uc2 Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, said afterward that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's decision "made it clear that states have no business criminalizing activities that have to do with immigration status and trying to interfere with the federal government's authority."\par \par \uc2 But Lott said he's quite optimistic that Utah's provision that requires police to check people's immigration status will be upheld based on the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's ruling in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "We feel like ours is even more restrictive than Arizona," Lott said after the hearing.\par \par \uc2 Tumlin disagreed, saying Waddoups' questions about whether the provision would violate some basic liberties showed he has real concerns. The judge mentioned he may send this part of the law to the Utah Supreme Court to get a ruling.\par \par \uc2 Tumlin said that would be a wise move, but Lott said it would only further delay the implementation of the law.\par \par \uc2 A dozen or so protesters held signs outside the courthouse denouncing the law.\par \par \uc2 "No, we will not show our papers," one read. "Full rights for immigrants. Stop HB497," said another.\par \par \uc2 "Laws like HB497 rip families apart," said Alicia Cervantes, a plaintiff in the case. "As a mother I shouldn't have to worry if my daughter is going to get pulled over just because she looks ethnic."\par \par \uc2 Lott said concerns about the law leading to racial profiling are unjustified.\par \par \uc2 "Utah's interest really is only in identifying illegal immigrants who break the law in Utah," Lott said. "The state is not going to be going door-to-door to look for illegal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130215e92f0013n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Ingmar Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, was convicted of her murder in 2010. But a judge has been holding sealed post-conviction hearings in recent weeks that could signal a problem with the prosecution.\par \par \uc2 After a 2 1/2-hour sealed proceeding on Thursday, District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Gerald Fisher said redacted, partial transcripts of hearings in December and January will be made available to the public and the media in about a week. A prosecutor said defense lawyers made assertions in those proceedings that the government does not agree with.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130214e92e002sw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Janet Napolitano\uc2  told a Senate panel Wednesday that she was not consulted about the case of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and registered sex offender before he was arrested in December.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano said she learned about the case against Luis Abrahan Sanchez Zavaleta after The Associated Press wrote about it last year.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez, a registered sex offender in New Jersey, was working as an unpaid intern for Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., when he was identified by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  eligible for deportation.\par \par \uc2 According to internal ICE documents provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee, agents were ready to arrest Sanchez in late October but were ordered to delay the arrest after superiors were told that the case could generate "significant Congressional and media interest." Sanchez was arrested in early December.\par \par \uc2 A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the case, told the AP last year that the Department of Homeland Security ordered that the arrest be delayed until after the November election. DHS has denied the allegation.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Napolitano did not address the specific reasons that led officials to delay Sanchez's arrest. She said the real issue was why Sanchez, 18, was not arrested by federal authorities in 2010, when ICE was first notified of his sex offense.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez, who came to the United States on a visitor visa good for six months, was arrested by New Jersey law enforcement on in October 2009 on state charges of aggravated sexual assault. He was later found to have violated the law and sentenced to probation and required to register as a sex offender.\par \par \uc2 According to the internal ICE documents, local prosecutors in New Jersey notified ICE about Sanchez sometime between March and May 2010. The documents show that the officer who received the notification determined that because Sanchez was a juvenile at the time of the offense, the case needed "additional research to determine removability." The case was put aside "in order to focus on high-priority cases that were ready for immediate action," the documents show.\par \par \uc2 "The more significant issue was what happened in those two years and why wasn't the removal made then," Napolitano told the Senate panel.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez has been released from immigration detention and is facing deportation. He has declined to comment on his case.\par \par \uc2 Menendez said he was not aware of Sanchez's arrest record or his immigration status until after he was arrested.\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 Follow Alicia A.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - Mariela Castano's daughter was so worried about her mother participating in a protest over conditions at immigrant detention centers that she begged her to bring along identification in case she was detained herself.\par \par \uc2 Castano, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Peru, was among a group of about 100 protesters who gathered in Liberty State Park in Jersey City Wednesday for an annual "Ash Wednesday" march. They hoped to call attention to an immigration detention system advocates say puts profits above humane treatment of detainees.\par \par \uc2 "I believe in this cause, and I believe in God, so I'm taking the risk of speaking out," Castano said in Spanish. "I'm speaking in hopes of raising the awareness of those, like the president and those in the Senate, who have the power to change this system."\par \par \uc2 Immigrants, both legal and illegal, who are facing deportation or otherwise held in federal custody, are subject to mandatory detention. They are housed in a variety of facilities around the country, from detention centers run by private contractors to local jails that receive reimbursement from the federal government for each immigrant detainee. They are classified as civil and not criminal detainees, and advocates have long argued that the majority are low-risk individuals who do not need to be detained in order to comply with deportation orders or court-related obligations.\par \par \uc2 "Even though politicians in Washington seem committed to comprehensive immigration reform, we see no signs that the federal government will reduce its reliance on a ballooning, financially wasteful and inhumane system," Lorna Henkel of IRATE & First Friends, one of the groups that organized Wednesday's event, said of the detention system.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Harold Ort, said the agency had made "tremendous strides" in reforming the civil detention system since the Obama Administration vowed in 2009 to overhaul it.\par \par \uc2 ICE is also dedicated to collaborating with non-governmental organizations to implement new policies and initiatives for immigration detention that prioritize; "the health and safety of detainees in our custody while increasing federal oversight and improving the conditions of confinement within the system," Ort said.\par \par \uc2 President Obama, in Tuesday's State of the Union address, called for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. On Wednesday the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the matter, with Democratic Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont calling for swift action while Republicans called for better border security first.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's march featured remarks by the Most Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, as well as other religious leaders, immigration activists and immigrants from a variety of backgrounds. They planned to stop at several immigrant detention centers in northern New Jersey before ending the day with a vigil at a detention center in Elizabeth.\par \par \uc2 Students from two Bergen County high schools, Don Bosco Prep in Ramsey and Immaculate Heart Academy in Washington Township, participated in in the event as part of a social justice curriculum at their schools.\par \par \uc2 Logan Springer, a freshman at Don Bosco, said he was surprised to learn about the conditions immigrant detainees were facing in his home state.\par \par \uc2 "I thought illegal immigrants were just deported, but they are detained in horrible conditions," Springer said. "When you get into this, you really see it's terrible."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Samantha Henry at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/SamanthaHenry"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/SamanthaHenry}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130213e92d001ol\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - More than three-quarters of New Jersey's police departments are unable to provide the public with basic information or gave wrong answers on how to file a complaint against the police, according to a report from the state chapter of the ACLU.\par \par \uc2 The survey of nearly 500 police agencies statewide found several problems in the way police agencies respond to citizens seeking information on how to file complaints.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  had volunteers call saying they were seeking information on whether they could file an internal affairs complaint by phone, as a juvenile without a parent present or as a third-party -- all scenarios permitted under New Jersey law. They also asked if immigration officials would be contacted if an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  wanted to bring a complaint against an officer.\par \par \uc2 In a report released Tuesday, the ACLU said more than half the departments provided at least one wrong answer, and many callers were treated with hostility, given misinformation or faced other obstacles. The report included audio excerpts of several calls.\par \par \uc2 "When citizens are given wrong information or are dissuaded from filing internal affairs complaints with a police department, it gives them no faith that the same department will conduct thorough and fair investigations into allegations of officer misconduct," said Alexander Shalom, policy counsel for ACLU-NJ. "It is hard for citizens to have faith in police departments that cannot police themselves."\par \par \uc2 The most egregious examples, according to the ACLU, included a police officer in a Hudson County department who demanded the caller give his name and stopped speaking when the caller refused. The report also cited an officer in Middlesex County who told the caller if a complainant is an "illegal alien, I don't know if he should be running around making complaints."\par \par \uc2 The majority of police departments in Cumberland, Salem and Morris counties scored high. In Morris, one police department employee told a caller that they would accommodate an immigrant wanting to file a complaint in their native language, if needed.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Hutchinson News, Feb. 11\par \par \uc2 Firepower\par \par \uc2 No one should make a rash decision in the heat of the battle.\par \par \uc2 Yet that exactly is what gun enthusiasts in the state have done with the Legislature's consideration of a measure that would override federal laws that apply to guns.\par \par \uc2 Some think the action is just a statement by lawmakers - telling the federal government to stay out of the state's business. Yet if it is just a statement, it is a ridiculous expense of legislative time. That shouldn't surprise us.\par \par \uc2 Kansas is considering a measure that assures Kansas-made guns and ones that remain in the state avoid congressional oversight. Incredibly, the bill has 50 sponsors, including Rep. Jan Pauls, D-Hutchinson. What a waste of time for those legislators as education issues and spending cuts loom over the Statehouse.\par \par \uc2 Could lawmakers find a better use of their time rather than trying to exempt Kansas-made guns from federal oversight?\par \par \uc2 The Second Amendment rears its head once again while the Newtown, Conn., shooting remains fresh in the minds of the nation.\par \par \uc2 The Second Amendment, said Rep. Kyle Hoffman, R-Coldwater, is "a pretty fundamental freedom that we have in the United States."\par \par \uc2 The more important question, aside from lawmakers wasting their time on silly legislation, though, is why the need for exempting Kansas-made guns from congressional oversight? Gun owners who have nothing to hide from the feds have no fears. They own the guns legally and face no retribution.\par \par \uc2 The ones to question are the gun owners who decide to hide their firearms from the government. If they're on the up-and-up, their gun ownership ought to be an open book.\par \par \uc2 The Second Amendment gives us the privilege to bear arms but not the right to abate congressional oversight.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Topeka Capital-Journal, Feb. 10\par \par \uc2 Editorial: Immigrant tuition policy should stand\par \par \uc2 A call for repeal of the policy that allows public universities in Kansas to change the children of illegal immigrants' in-state tuition rates has surfaced yet again. The call should go unanswered, again.\par \par \uc2 Yes, illegal is illegal, and everyone knows what that means. That includes members of Congress, who certainly know what illegal means but seldom show much concern about immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Calls for immigration reform were numerous even before Kansas adopted the policy to allow the children of illegal immigrants to attend state universities at the in-state tuition rates. But Congress offered nothing but talk.\par \par \uc2 Many Democratic office holders at the federal level haven't wanted to get tough on illegal immigration because it could cost them votes among the fastest-growing voting block in the country, citizens of Hispanic descent. Democrats can count being well-received at the voting booths by that voting block, although Republicans have plans to make inroads.\par \par \uc2 Many Republican office holders haven't wanted to get tough on illegal immigration because some of their supporters -- the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 , many state chambers of commerce and some businesses -- don't want to get tough on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Given that the federal government, which is tasked with handling immigration issues, has shown so little interest, why should we pick on the children of illegal immigrants who want to seek an education so they can get good jobs, contribute to society and pay taxes?\par \par \uc2 It would be different if the federal government was actively taking steps to round up large numbers of illegal immigrants -- estimates are they number 11 million -- and send them to their home countries, but that's not the case. Therefore, Congress passing a federal law prohibiting universities from charging in-state tuition to children of undocumented residents if the same benefit isn't extended to all U.S. citizens bordered on hypocrisy.\par \par \uc2 What isn't hypocritical is Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach suggesting the Legislature pass a law denying public services to aliens and repeal its in-state tuition policy. Kobach had done all he can, we think, to help states interested in fighting illegal immigration do so. When he talks about the issue to the Legislature or other audiences, he is being true to his colors.\par \par \uc2 But at the national level, many Republicans are rethinking their stance on immigration issues and are entertaining the idea of a "pathway" to citizenship for illegal immigrants now in the United States. How far that will get is yet to be determined but the Republican Party nationally is serious about increasing its appeal among the Hispanic voting bloc.\par \par \uc2 Here in Kansas, some organizations want to make it easier to hire \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor, and businesses protest at suggestions they should be penalized financially for hiring undocumented workers.\par \par \uc2 So if work is available for illegal immigrants who are parents and there are so few who want to do anything to change that, why punish their children by making them pay out-of-state tuition? And given the high and ever-rising cost of earning a college diploma, the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition should be considered punishment. It definitely would be a hindrance to furthering their education.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant children brought here by their parents are not guilty of the sins of their mothers and fathers. If they can show they have been living in Kansas long enough to be considered state residents, disregarding their parents' legal status, they should be allowed to attend Kansas' public universities at the in-state tuition rate.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Wichita Eagle, Feb. 8\par \par \uc2 Cause for optimism?\par \par \uc2 If it's a good-faith move, the state's request last week for mediation in the ongoing school-finance lawsuit seems like cause for cautious optimism. Too bad there are so many other reasons to view it as a stalling tactic unlikely to prevent a constitutional showdown.\par \par \uc2 Acting at the request of Gov. Sam Brownback, Attorney General \uc2 Derek Schmidt\uc2  filed motions Thursday with the Kansas Supreme Court requesting both the mediation and a stay of last month's Shawnee County District Court ruling that current state funding of K-12 public schools is unconstitutionally low.\par \par \uc2 To his credit, Brownback acknowledged in a statement that "we owe it to Kansas taxpayers, parents, teachers and students to examine every available avenue to resolve this dispute to the satisfaction of all involved."\par \par \uc2 But the parties in the lawsuit would go into mediation far, far apart.\par \par \uc2 When the three-judge panel sided with the school districts that sued the state, including Wichita's USD 259, it called for lawmakers to raise the base per-pupil state aid by $654.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Brownback recommends no per-pupil increase for schools next year and only $14 the next.\par \par \uc2 The gap between zero and $437 million, which is what the court's funding directive would cost the state in the 2013-14 school year, is quite a chasm to bridge in mediation or anywhere else, especially with the governor trying to cover a budget shortfall created by last year's imprudent income-tax cuts and asking the Legislature for more.\par \par \uc2 Hopes for a settlement are dragged further down by other recent schools-related activity at the Statehouse.\par \par \uc2 The GOP push to alter the constitution to give Brownback more power to choose appellate judges and to spell out that "the financing of the educational interests of the state is exclusively a legislative power" are both aimed at avoiding a replay of 2005 and 2006, when the Legislature dramatically increased school funding on orders from the state Supreme Court. Brownback's claim that only 54 percent of education dollars go to instruction, and insistence on aiming for the arbitrary 65 percent standard, similarly seems meant to undercut arguments that schools are underfunded. The Statehouse also is seeing efforts to curb school districts' lobbying and teachers unions' political activity and collective-bargaining power - legislation that hardly could be interpreted as pro-public schools.\par \par \uc2 Plus, it's hard to see any agreement reached with a mediator automatically holding up in the House or Senate, where appropriations for schools and other state-funded services must be approved. And if the confidentiality of mediation "will enhance the probability that a settlement can be reached," as Schmidt said, it would deny Kansans the ability to observe such an important decision-making process.\par \par \uc2 But a court order is not the preferred method for getting the Legislature to follow the constitution and "make suitable provision for finance of the educational interests of the state." If mediation can be the means to ending both the lawsuit and the trend of deep cuts to school operating budgets, Kansans should be all for it.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Garden City Telegram, Feb. 7\par \par \uc2 Rural boost\par \par \uc2 When rolled out last year, a new program focused on luring people to rural Kansas showed promise.\par \par \uc2 Based on early reports, the Kansas Rural Opportunity Zones incentive pushed by Gov. Sam Brownback is indeed showing signs of paying off.\par \par \uc2 Communities in Kansas have reported new residents taking advantage of the program, which offers incentives to people who move from out of state to Kansas counties that have experienced steep population declines, or are relatively poor.\par \par \uc2 Statewide, 77 of Kansas' 105 counties lost residents from 2000 to 2010, with 23 losing more than 10 percent of their populations, according to U.S. Census figures. Rural counties in particular know the pain of such erosion.\par \par \uc2 Not surprisingly, many of the 50 counties targeted for the deal to lure new residents are in western Kansas, which has endured ongoing population losses.\par \par \uc2 Under the program, new residents don't have to pay state income tax through 2016. They also may participate in a state-matching program to help pay off student loans, which could help bring doctors, dentists and other professionals to underserved areas.\par \par \uc2 More than 600 people reportedly have applied to have up to $15,000 of their student loans repaid. Of that figure, roughly half have been approved, with many more pending. Applications reportedly have come from 38 states.\par \par \uc2 The plan isn't a cure-all, of course. Communities involved must deliver jobs and other amenities to attract and keep residents. Multiple strategies are needed to help rural areas rebound during challenging economic times.\par \par \uc2 Still, consider the Rural Opportunity Zones plan a proactive way to help communities that otherwise might have to concede to population losses with such drastic measures as closing schools and pursuing other consolidation.\par \par \uc2 The program was pitched as an opportunity to fuel economic growth while investing in the future of counties trying to survive.\par \par \uc2 While there's plenty to dislike about the governor's overall plan to spur economic growth -- one featuring massive tax cuts that will slash the state's income -- consider the Rural Opportunity Zones program a welcome strategy at a time Kansas should do more to support and preserve its rural way of life.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130212e92c001h4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS (AP) - Immigration activists in Las Vegas are hoping to capitalize on the momentum President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  brought when he spoke on the topic here last month.\par \par \uc2 Two unions teamed up Monday to hold a rally at the Cashman Center convention hall in North Las Vegas in support of a major immigration overhaul.\par \par \uc2 The Culinary Union drew about 1,000 hotel workers to the convention center in the morning to discuss contract negotiations at several mega-casinos on the Strip, Spokeswoman Yvanna Cancela said.\par \par \uc2 Around noon, the Nevada State AFL-CIO brought those workers together with students, immigration advocates and labor leaders for an hour-long demonstration.\par \par \uc2 One of the nation's largest unions, the \uc2 AFL-CIO\uc2  has scheduled rallies in 14 cities to encourage Congress to approve comprehensive reform. The push began in Raleigh, N.C., on Wednesday and will continue through March in cities including San Francisco, Atlanta, Miami and New York.\par \par \uc2 The federation has pledged to educate voters and pressure elected officials using the same infrastructure that helped re-elect Obama.\par \par \uc2 In Nevada, the second stop on the tour, the Latino voting population has been growing and coalescing into a formidable battleground state voting bloc.\par \par \uc2 In January, Obama spoke at a Las Vegas high school during a campaign-style event to launch his immigration reform effort.\par \par \uc2 Nevada \uc2 AFL-CIO\uc2  spokeswoman Emmelle Israel said the speech showed that immigrants are amassing power in the Silver State.\par \par \uc2 "It's a really important state for comprehensive immigration reform, as we saw with President Obama's visit last month," she said. "We've seen here in Nevada the political power that immigrant communities are building."\par \par \uc2 Latinos now make up more than a quarter of the Nevada population. Illegal immigrants account for 7 percent of residents, more than any other state, and 10 percent of the workforce, according to a 2011 Pew Hispanic Center study.\par \par \uc2 The White House confirmed on Monday that a 20-year old student from Las Vegas who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  will be among the guests invited to Obama's State of the Union speech Tuesday night.\par \par \uc2 Unions across the country are supporting a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, saying the change will lead to better wages and working conditions.\par \par \uc2 Among the strongest of Nevada's labor organizations is Culinary Workers Local 226, a fast-growing union made up of predominantly immigrant hotel and casino employees.\par \par \uc2 The union is preparing to negotiate new contracts in June with \uc2 MGM Resorts International\uc2  and \uc2 Caesars Entertainment Corporation\uc2 , which, combined, manage more than a dozen major casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, including Caesars Palace, \uc2 Planet Hollywood\uc2  , the MGM Grand and the Bellagio.\par \par \uc2 The union's 2007 contract, which also includes downtown casinos, stipulates health and retirement benefits, wages, and job security mandates.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Hannah Dreier can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/hannahdreier"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/hannahdreier }}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130211e92b00267\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HELENA, Mont. (AP) - An advocacy group told a judge Thursday that a new voter-approved law unconstitutionally requires state agencies to determine who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and turn them over to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 The plaintiffs led by the Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance asked District Judge Jeffrey Sherlock to block the law, which requires proof of citizenship or legal standing from any applicant for state services, such as unemployment benefits and assistance for crime victims.\par \par \uc2 The law, which was approved by nearly 80 percent of voters in November, took effect Jan. 1, but most state agencies have not started applying it. There have been no instances of anybody being denied services or deported as a result of it.\par \par \uc2 Still, plaintiffs' attorney Brian Miller said enforcement can happen at any time without due process or any way to appeal, which creates the need for Sherlock to block the law until the constitutional challenge is decided.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody knows when they are going to be mugged. Nobody knows when they are going to be laid off," Miller said.\par \par \uc2 Montana Solicitor General Lawrence Van Dyke said the law should not be blocked because there is no evidence anybody has been harmed by it.\par \par \uc2 Blocking the law would actually do harm because state agencies would be prevented from limiting services and benefits only to those who are eligible to receive them, he said.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit only challenges the requirement that agencies ask applicants for proof of eligibility, not the state's rights to withhold benefits from illegal immigrants, he said.\par \par \uc2 "It's OK to set criteria, but it's not OK to require proof they meet that?" Van Dyke said.\par \par \uc2 Sherlock did not make an immediate decision on the request for a preliminary injunction.\par \par \uc2 The Republican state lawmakers who put the measure on the ballot claim illegal immigrants are living on the taxpayers' dime by obtaining food stamps, unemployment benefits, disability benefits, state licenses and aid for university students.\par \par \uc2 The new law requires proof of legal standing for any applicant for state services, employment with a state agency, issuance of a state license or permit, unemployment or disability benefits, enrollment as a student or student aid.\par \par \uc2 The state Board of Regents says the law does not apply to the university system because the state Constitution gives the board sole authority over the system.\par \par \uc2 Miller presented two witnesses who said the law would affect them. Andrea Carlson, a United Kingdom-born resident of Miles City, said a judge recently ruled that she is a citizen because her father was a citizen and served in the military, but she has yet to get documentation beyond that order.\par \par \uc2 She is concerned that won't be enough if she finds herself in need of a state service, such as a police response to a crime.\par \par \uc2 "I wouldn't have any recourse at all if I were mugged in the street," she said.\par \par \uc2 Alisha Blair, a Canadian-born Missoula resident, said she is contesting denial of a certificate of citizenship and is concerned about the possible consequences of not having documentation.\par \par \uc2 Blair said she was accepted into the University of Montana in 2009 but did not attend because she was denied financial aid because of her citizenship status.\par \par \uc2 Van Dyke said the two women have not been affected by the law, and it was unlikely they would be, given their particular circumstances.\par \par \uc2 The state attorney said not all agencies will necessary conduct investigations into applicants for state services. The agencies are primarily required to ask for proof of citizenship or legal standing, he said. The agency then has the option of conducting a further inquiry to determine eligibility.\par \par \uc2 If an agency does conduct an inquiry and finds evidence that a person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , the agency must then turn over that name to federal immigration officials, he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130207e92700275\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Illegal immigrants might face around a 10-year wait to become legal permanent U.S. residents under sweeping immigration overhaul legislation taking shape in the Senate, negotiators said Thursday. That's shorter than some current wait times though longer than some advocates might like.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and \uc2 Robert Menendez\uc2  of New Jersey discussed the timeline in a roundtable meeting with Hispanic-focused media. The senators and their aides emphasized that nothing has been agreed to and the timeline could change.\par \par \uc2 The timeline refers to how long someone would have to wait in a new provisional legal status before qualifying for permanent residency and a green card. The legislation is expected to immediately grant provisional legal status to many of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants now in the country, but they couldn't get green cards until the border has been secured, and they would have to meet criteria including learning English and paying fines.\par \par \uc2 The process "is likely to be in the range of 10 years, I say in the range because we have not nailed this down," Durbin said. He said various factors go into the timeline, including the need to establish border security first, something Republicans have insisted on.\par \par \uc2 Menendez said a 10-year wait would not be inordinate considering that under current law many illegal immigrants face a 10-year prohibition against returning to the country if they leave.\par \par \uc2 "If you think about it, under current law there is a 10-year bar, so the bottom line is you would have to wait anyway," Menendez said. "The difference is you would get the opportunity to be here, to come forward, to work, to travel, and in doing so to earn your pathway" to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 A green card is the crucial first step toward citizenship although it takes up to five years for a green card holder to become a citizen under current law. So if it takes 10 years to get a green card, the total wait time for citizenship could be closer to 15, advocates fear.\par \par \uc2 "We understand that bipartisan lawmaking requires compromise. But we think waiting 15 years for a chance to become a citizen is too long," said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice. "We will continue to fight for a clear, direct and inclusive path to citizenship that has achievable requirements and a more reasonable time frame."\par \par \uc2 The emerging legislation, which faces an uncertain future in Congress, is expected to require illegal immigrants to petition for citizenship behind those already attempting the process. That means some length of wait would be inevitable, although experts said lawmakers could shorten the wait times by making more green cards available.\par \par \uc2 "Going to the back of the line is inevitably a lengthy process because of current backlogs for which there have been insufficient numbers of visas in current law," said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Wait times vary greatly under current law for people to get green cards, depending on factors including what country they're from. For Mexicans trying to join family members legally in the U.S. the wait time can be 12 to 15 years, Meissner said.\par \par \uc2 The exact process and length of time for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to get a green card is just one of many contentious issues being discussed by Durbin, Menendez and six other senators in a bipartisan group trying to finalize an immigration bill by spring. Even if they succeed the bill faces a tough road in the Democratic-controlled Senate and an even tougher one in the Republican-led House.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., another negotiator on the legislation, emphasized no decisions have been made. "Nothing has been decided yet with respect to the path to citizenship," Schumer said through a spokesman in response to the comments from Durbin and Menendez.\par \par \uc2 Also Thursday, union leaders announced a 14-city campaign to mobilize support for immigration overhaul plans.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Luis Alonso Lugo and Sam Hananel contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130207e927001vr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HELENA, Mont. (AP) - A new voter-approved Montana law that requires an individual to provide proof of citizenship to receive state services does not apply to the university system, an associate commissioner for higher education said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The state constitution gives the Board of Regents exclusive authority to manage and control the university system, including setting policies and regulations, Kevin McRae said. The new law that requires proof of citizenship or legal residency for services infringes on that constitutional authority, he said.\par \par \uc2 He said the board is not disputing the will of the people, but the Montana Constitution clearly establishes that separation of powers.\par \par \uc2 "We view it as if the people have already spoken," McRae said. "The people have said in the ratification of the 1972 constitution that the Board of Regents is the ultimate governing authority within the university system."\par \par \uc2 The system already has checks in place that weed out most illegal immigrants who apply for enrollment, he said.\par \par \uc2 State residents must pass through a rigorous residency test in the application process, McRae said. That test is not required for out-of-state students. But since they pay much higher tuition than in-state students, the board does not believe those students actually receive a state service under the legal definition, McRae said.\par \par \uc2 "We think it would be hard for an \uc2 illegal (immigrant\uc2 ) to slip through," he said.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 80 percent of voters in November approved the measure that requires every person who seeks any state service to prove he is a U.S. citizen or in the country legally. The initiative defines state services as employment with a state agency, issuance of a state license or permit, and unemployment or disability benefits.\par \par \uc2 It also specifically names "qualification as a student in the university system" and "student financial assistance" as services to be prohibited without proof of citizenship or legal residency.\par \par \uc2 The Republican state lawmakers who put the measure on the ballot claim illegal immigrants live on the taxpayers' dime by obtaining food stamps, unemployment benefits, disability benefits, state licenses -- and aid for university students.\par \par \uc2 The Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance is leading a lawsuit challenging the new law's constitutionality. The group claims the law infringes on the right to privacy, due process and equal protection.\par \par \uc2 There are no restrictions in the law as to how to protect privacy or limit dissemination of private information, and the law does not specify how the state agencies should determine a person's status, the lawsuit claims.\par \par \uc2 "This raises a substantial possibility that many average Montanans could be wrongly denied services and be swept up by" the Department of Homeland Security, it reads.\par \par \uc2 The alliance has named the state, Gov. Steve Bullock, Attorney General \uc2 Tim Fox\uc2 , the Board of Regents and Higher Education Commissioner Clayton Christian as defendants.\par \par \uc2 Deputy Solicitor General Lawrence Van Dyke said in a court filing that the lawsuit's claims are "far-reaching" and that nobody can have a reasonable expectation of receiving state benefits without first demonstrating they are eligible for them.\par \par \uc2 Regents attorney Jessica Brubaker is representing Christian and the board separately from the other state defendants. She said she plans at some point to ask Judge Jeffrey Sherlock to dismiss Christian and the board as defendants.\par \par \uc2 Brian Miller, the attorney representing the Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance, said his clients agree with the regents' argument that the initiative does not apply to the university system.\par \par \uc2 Attorney general spokesman \uc2 John Barnes\uc2  said his office does not have a position on the board's argument.\par \par \uc2 A court hearing on the alliance's request for a preliminary injunction blocking the law is scheduled for Thursday in Helena.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130206e926002y3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 EL PASO, Texas (AP) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Janet Napolitano\uc2  called Republican lawmakers' insistence that the border be secured before there is immigration reform a flawed argument.\par \par \uc2 At a stop to inspect border security in El Paso on Tuesday, Napolitano said the argument ignores gains made in \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  captures as well as seizures of drugs, weapons and currency.\par \par \uc2 She also said the argument's fundamental flaw is contending that border security is unrelated to interior enforcement such as verification of legal residence of job applicants.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano said the immigration "system as a whole is badly in need of reform." It is, she said, inextricably linked with interior enforcement, visa reform and the process for legal migration, a pathway to citizenship and earned pathway for those already here.\par \par \uc2 A bipartisan group of senators wants assurances on border security as Congress considers proposals that would bring the biggest changes to immigration law in nearly three decades. Last week, the group of senators released a blueprint that would bring a path to citizenship for people living in the U.S. illegally, but they demanded assurances on border security first.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama does not endorse such a linkage in his own immigration proposal. But Republicans in the Senate group, including \uc2 John McCain\uc2  of Arizona and \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida, say they cannot support an immigration bill that doesn't make a pathway to citizenship conditional on a secure border.\par \par \uc2 "I believe the border is secure. I believe the border's a safe border. That's not to say everything is 100 percent," Napolitano said Monday in San Diego during the first leg of her trip to the Southwest border.\par \par \uc2 The current administration has "deployed historic levels of personnel, technology and infrastructure to help secure the Southwest border," she said Tuesday. It has meant that attempts to illegally cross from Mexico are half of what they were in 2008 and a 78 percent down from their peak in 2000. "The numbers are the numbers," she said.\par \par \uc2 Last year only, the El Paso sector saw an increase of 71 percent in seizures of currency, 39 percent more drugs interdicted and a 139 percent of illegal weapons seized, the secretary said. The sector includes far West Texas and all of New Mexico.\par \par \uc2 And while the perception of security along the border has improved with increased Border Patrol presence, there are still some rural stretches where officials still complain of illegal crossings by drug smugglers and traffickers of illegal immigrants. "I would agree that it's better now than five years ago, but it still is a huge cat and mouse game with these guys," said Patrick Green, a sheriff's deputy in New Mexico's Hidalgo County.\par \par \uc2 Green talked about reports of vehicle and firearms thefts and break-ins in ranches along the borderland.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano said that while the Border Patrol launched large scale operations in sectors like San Diego, Tucson, El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas, there are still sparsely populated rural areas where they are increasing the presence of agents, deployed sensors and installed or outposts. "That's not to say there will never be an illegal crossing on the Southwest border. ... People with common sense understand that."\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol made 356,873 apprehensions on the Mexican border during the 2012 fiscal year, up 8.9 percent from the previous year but still hovering near 40-year-lows. \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2 's budget nearly doubled to $11.7 billion in 2012 from $6.3 billion in 2005, according to figures from the Migration Policy Institute.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130206e92600051\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) - An Alaska House committee on Tuesday advanced a bill that would allow the state Department of Motor Vehicles to issue short-term drivers licenses to temporary residents.\par \par \uc2 HB1, by Rep. Bob Lynn, R-Anchorage, would allow the department to issue licenses that expire as soon as a temporary resident's authorization to live in the U.S. has finished.\par \par \uc2 "The way it is today, somebody with a visa -- a visitor to the United States -- that expires in two weeks can walk into the DMV and get a driver's license that doesn't expire for five years. This bill simply links the duration of the driver's license to the duration of the visa, or any other legal kind of document," Lynn said at a hearing of the House State Affairs Committee on Tuesday morning.\par \par \uc2 The measure also would require residents who are authorized to stay indefinitely to renew their license every year, but they would be allowed to renew their license by mail. Applicable renewal fees would be waived for the first five years.\par \par \uc2 A standard Alaska driver's license expires on the licensee's birthday five years after the license was issued.\par \par \uc2 The bill does not discuss state identification cards, which can be issued for under five years, nor does it change the documentation or verification procedures that the DMV uses today.\par \par \uc2 Some committee members expressed concern over potential loopholes and a lack of regulatory standards. When renewing a license -- either through mail or in person -- drivers do not need to re-submit any form of identification. If a temporary citizen were to legally extend his or her stay, the DMV would need to create a system for short-term license holders to renew, according to Shelly Mellott, deputy director of the DMV.\par \par \uc2 North Pole Rep. Doug Isaacson, who has added his name as co-sponsor of the bill, said he thinks the bill's secondary intent "is to not allow an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to have a document that says that they're legal in Alaska."\par \par \uc2 The bill now goes to the House Judiciary Committee.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Details on HB1: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/WvM1AO"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/WvM1AO}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130129e91t00197\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - A 54-year-old Korean man has pleaded not guilty to new federal charges alleging he conspired to transport \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  women from New York to Mississippi and harbored them in Biloxi, Miss., for prostitution.\par \par \uc2 The Sun Herald reports ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/14qZ2Pr"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/14qZ2Pr}}}\uc2 ) Moonseop Kim also is accused of driving the women to prearranged meetings to have sex for money.\par \par \uc2 Kim has been in custody since his arrest Sept. 30 after being indicted on related crimes in the two months before his arrest. He now faces six new counts including two conspiracy charges alleging the harboring of women for financial gain and immoral purposes.\par \par \uc2 He entered the plea this past week in federal court in Gulfport. He is set for trial April 1.\par \par \uc2 Authorities have said the investigation began after a Biloxi police detective found an online escort service ad for a "super-hot and sexy Korean girl." The detective called to make a date with a girl at a local hotel, which reportedly led undercover officers to Kim and a young woman who was living at the rental home.\par \par \uc2 The new indictment indicates agents are trying to link others to the allegations over a longer period of time, nearly two years, from January 2011 through Oct. 1, 2012.\par \par \uc2 The indictment alleges a financial backer placed an ad for Biloxi escorts in January 2011 in The Little Saigon News, a nationwide Vietnamese newspaper.\par \par \uc2 It also accuses Kim of picking up one of the woman at the Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport in August and taking her to the rental home in Biloxi to work as a prostitute. It's unclear if that is the 26-year-old woman arrested with Kim, or what became of her. She has not been charged in the federal case.\par \par \uc2 Kim was denied bond in October, when an agent testified Kim had overstayed his visa and is in the country illegally. The agent testified Kim could provide no permanent address and said he told them he didn't know who owned the car he had been driving.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Sun Herald, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.sunherald.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.sunherald.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130129e91t00107\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - As Illinois becomes the fourth and most populous state to give illegal immigrants permission to drive, nagging concerns remain about whether there are enough safeguards to avoid the identity fraud and other pitfalls other states faced.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Gov. \uc2 Pat Quinn\uc2  signed Illinois' measure into law Sunday in Chicago. Backers, including Quinn, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and some of the state's top Republicans, tout it as a public-safety measure. They argue that required facial recognition technology is reliable enough to prevent fraud.\par \par \uc2 They hailed it as an important step for immigrant rights in Illinois, which approved its own Dream Act in 2010 to create a privately-funded scholarship program for immigrant students. President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  plans to discuss his plan to overhaul the immigration system during a trip to Las Vegas on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 "This was a bipartisan effort to pass an important law," Quinn said. "When the president speaks on Tuesday, he can say about his home state of Illinois ... we not only passed the Dream Act last year, we passed driver's licenses for those who are undocumented ."\par \par \uc2 However, the law's opponents have pointed to hundreds of fraudulent cases in New Mexico, Washington and Utah after those states began giving illegal immigrants permission to drive. Illinois will not require applicants to be fingerprinted, for fear that would discourage immigrants from applying.\par \par \uc2 "How many people would apply for this document knowing that fingerprints will be going to (federal authorities)? Probably not all that many," said Fred Tsao, policy director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, a driving-force behind the measure.\par \par \uc2 Proponents say it will allow an estimated 250,000 people unlawfully residing in the state to apply for a three-year temporary driver's license and require them to get training and insurance. The Illinois secretary of state's office said the licenses will be available starting in October.\par \par \uc2 Those ready for the change include 45-year-old Victoria Chavez.\par \par \uc2 "I need to get my driver's license because I have two kids," the Chicago woman said. "They need my support. This is a victory for all of us in the immigrant community."\par \par \uc2 The licenses will be like those already issued to certain foreign-born, legal visitors. Applicants will be photographed, and their photo will be entered into the state's facial recognition database -- like the rest of Illinois' licensed drivers-- to verify their identity.\par \par \uc2 But other states' driving programs for illegal immigrants have been abused. New Mexico and Washington both issue licenses, while Utah issues a permit.\par \par \uc2 An Associated Press investigation last year found a striking pattern in New Mexico, suggesting immigrants tried to game the system to obtain a license. In one instance, 48 foreign-born individuals claimed to live at a smoke shop in Albuquerque to fulfill a residency condition.\par \par \uc2 Authorities also busted a fraud ring last year that forged documents for illegal immigrants to use after driving from as far as Illinois and North Carolina to obtain a New Mexico license. Republican Gov. Susana Martinez has vowed for years to repeal the decade-old measure, but the Legislature has rejected such efforts.\par \par \uc2 Washington's requirements attracted national attention when Jose Antonio Vargas, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, revealed his illegal immigration status in an essay for the \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  in 2011. Vargas chronicled how he obtained his Washington license. State authorities conducted an investigation that revealed Vargas did not reside at the address he stated in his application and canceled his license.\par \par \uc2 Utah's permit is not valid for identification. Illinois' law follows suit.\par \par \uc2 Utah's Republican-controlled Legislature amended the state's law in 2011 to require illegal immigrants to be fingerprinted, and mandates that the state notify \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  if an applicant's fingerprint check yields a felony on record. If the applicant has a misdemeanor warrant outstanding, the state must notify the agency that is seeking the person's arrest.\par \par \uc2 That kind of information-sharing between state and immigration authorities worries Illinois' immigrant-rights advocates, such as Tsao, who pushed for the legislation without a fingerprinting requirement. They say fingerprinting could deter potential licensees from applying for fear of being identified and deported.\par \par \uc2 Local law enforcement officials argue in favor of fingerprinting.\par \par \uc2 "We could see if they have committed a crime; it could be a crime in another state or it could be a crime in their home country," said John Kennedy, executive director of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police.\par \par \uc2 The Illinois secretary of state's office says its facial recognition database is highly sophisticated and accurate. The program uses an algorithm to match more than a dozen facial features that are not easy to alter, such as eye sockets and sides of the mouth.\par \par \uc2 "The integrity of our driver's license system is a priority," said Henry Haupt, a spokesman for the office.\par \par \uc2 The bill's sponsor, Rep. \uc2 Edward Acevedo\uc2 , a Chicago Democrat, said state roads will be safer because illegal immigrants will receive training and be tested before obtaining a license. They also will be required to purchase insurance, Acevedo said.\par \par \uc2 Tsao's organization estimates uninsured \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  drivers cause $64 million in damage claims each year, an expense currently covered by increased premiums.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Garcia Cano reported from Springfield, Ill.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130128e91s0000j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Illinois Gov. \uc2 Pat Quinn\uc2  is scheduled to sign a measure Sunday that will make his state the fourth and most populous to permit illegal immigrants to drive. Proponents say the measure will improve safety on the roads, but critics warn of the potential for identity fraud. Below are the requirements for receiving a permit.\par \par \uc2 -- Submit to facial recognition software, but no fingerprinting.\par \par \uc2 -- Provide proof of written signature, proof of date of birth and a letter of ineligibility for a Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 -- Show valid passport from a home country or a consular identification card, and two documents that show a minimum one-year residency in the state.\par \par \uc2 -- Receive drivers training and undergo vision screening, written and driving tests.\par \par \uc2 -- Purchase insurance.\par \par \uc2 The purple-bordered card will be different than regular licenses, and valid only for driving purposes. It cannot be used as a form of identification, meaning licenses can't be used to buy a firearm, register to vote or board a plane.\par \par \uc2 Applicants who satisfy all requirements will receive their license by mail, not at state facilities. The state will begin accepting applications at least 10 months after the governor signs the bill. Each card will cost $30, the same cost of a regular license.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130127e91r003c4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - As Illinois becomes the fourth and most populous state to give illegal immigrants permission to drive, nagging concerns remain about whether there are enough safeguards to avoid the identity fraud and other pitfalls other states faced.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Gov. \uc2 Pat Quinn\uc2  signed Illinois' measure into law Sunday in Chicago. Backers, including Quinn, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and some of the state's top Republicans, tout it as a public-safety measure. They argue that required facial recognition technology is reliable enough to prevent fraud.\par \par \uc2 They hailed it as an important step for immigrant rights in Illinois, which approved its own Dream Act in 2010 to create a privately-funded scholarship program for immigrant students.\par \par \uc2 "This was a bipartisan effort to pass an important law," Quinn said. "When the president speaks on Tuesday, he can say about his home state of Illinois ... we not only passed the Dream Act last year, we passed driver's licenses for those who are undocumented."\par \par \uc2 However, the law's opponents have pointed to hundreds of fraudulent cases in New Mexico, Washington and Utah after those states began giving illegal immigrants permission to drive. Illinois will not require applicants to be fingerprinted, for fear that would discourage immigrants from applying.\par \par \uc2 "How many people would apply for this document knowing that fingerprints will be going to (federal authorities)? Probably not all that many," said Fred Tsao, policy director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, a driving-force behind the measure.\par \par \uc2 Proponents say it will allow an estimated 250,000 people unlawfully residing in the state to apply for a three-year temporary driver's license and require them to get training and insurance. The Illinois secretary of state's office said the licenses will be available starting in November.\par \par \uc2 Those ready for the change include 45-year-old Victoria Chavez.\par \par \uc2 "I need to get my driver's license because I have two kids," the Chicago woman said. "They need my support. This is a victory for all of us in the immigrant community."\par \par \uc2 The licenses will be like those already issued to certain foreign-born, legal visitors. Applicants will be photographed, and their photo will be entered into the state's facial recognition database -- like the rest of Illinois' licensed drivers-- to verify their identity.\par \par \uc2 But other states' driving programs for illegal immigrants have been abused. New Mexico and Washington both issue licenses, while Utah issues a permit.\par \par \uc2 An Associated Press investigation last year found a striking pattern in New Mexico, suggesting immigrants tried to game the system to obtain a license. In one instance, 48 foreign-born individuals claimed to live at a smoke shop in Albuquerque to fulfill a residency condition.\par \par \uc2 Authorities also busted a fraud ring last year that forged documents for illegal immigrants to use after driving from as far as Illinois and North Carolina to obtain a New Mexico license. Republican Gov. Susana Martinez has vowed for years to repeal the decade-old measure, but the Legislature has rejected such efforts.\par \par \uc2 Washington's requirements attracted national attention when Jose Antonio Vargas, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, revealed his illegal immigration status in an essay for the \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  in 2011. Vargas chronicled how he obtained his Washington license. State authorities conducted an investigation that revealed Vargas did not reside at the address he stated in his application and canceled his license.\par \par \uc2 Utah's permit is not valid for identification. Illinois' law follows suit.\par \par \uc2 Utah's Republican-controlled Legislature amended the state's law in 2011 to require illegal immigrants to be fingerprinted, and mandates that the state notify \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  if an applicant's fingerprint check yields a felony on record. If the applicant has a misdemeanor warrant outstanding, the state must notify the agency that is seeking the person's arrest.\par \par \uc2 That kind of information-sharing between state and immigration authorities worries Illinois' immigrant-rights advocates, such as Tsao, who pushed for the legislation without a fingerprinting requirement. They say fingerprinting could deter potential licensees from applying for fear of being identified and deported.\par \par \uc2 Local law enforcement officials argue in favor of fingerprinting.\par \par \uc2 "We could see if they have committed a crime; it could be a crime in another state or it could be a crime in their home country," said John Kennedy, executive director of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police.\par \par \uc2 The Illinois secretary of state's office says its facial recognition database is highly sophisticated and accurate. The program uses an algorithm to match more than a dozen facial features that are not easy to alter, such as eye sockets and sides of the mouth.\par \par \uc2 "The integrity of our driver's license system is a priority," said Henry Haupt, a spokesman for the office.\par \par \uc2 The bill's sponsor, Rep. \uc2 Edward Acevedo\uc2 , a Chicago Democrat, said state roads will be safer because illegal immigrants will receive training and be tested before obtaining a license. They also will be required to purchase insurance, Acevedo said.\par \par \uc2 Tsao's organization estimates uninsured \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  drivers cause $64 million in damage claims each year, an expense currently covered by increased premiums.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Garcia Cano reported from Springfield, Ill.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130127e91r003c1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) - An alleged Mexican drug cartel manager who authorities say stayed involved in cartel business right up until his conviction through coded phone conversations from a U.S. jail was sentenced Thursday to seven years in prison on immigration and weapon charges.\par \par \uc2 Jose Luis Zuniga Hernandez, known as "El Wicho," managed Gulf cartel operations in Matamoros, Mexico, just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville before fleeing to the U.S. to escape enemies, federal authorities said. When arrested near the border in 2011, Zuniga was carrying more than $36,000, cocaine and a gold-plated handgun engraved with his nickname.\par \par \uc2 Zuniga, 44, pleaded guilty earlier this month to illegal re-entry and being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  possessing a firearm. He was sentenced in Brownsville.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen explained that he would not lengthen Zuniga's sentence for his involvement in the cartel, because he wasn't formally charged with those crimes. But the judge noted Zuniga's prior criminal history in the U.S. and the fact that he had a gun, cash and cocaine when arrested, which he said made Zuniga "a serious threat to the well-being of the citizens of Texas."\par \par \uc2 Zuniga is the latest in a string of Gulf cartel bosses who were arrested on both sides of the border in the past year. Still, the U.S. Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley sector -- which guards the section of border fronting the Gulf cartel's territory -- has seized nearly 250,000 pounds of marijuana so far this fiscal year.\par \par \uc2 In brief comments in Spanish, Zuniga asked for forgiveness from his family, Hanen and people he hurt.\par \par \uc2 Zuniga denied in court that he was the man behind "El Wicho" and other nicknames, though authorities say he proudly explained their origins in the days following his arrest.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent Luis Flores testified Thursday that Zuniga had been involved in drug smuggling since at least 1990, when he was convicted in a drug conspiracy that included more than a ton of marijuana. Zuniga told authorities that he did not start working directly for the Gulf cartel until late 2002 or early 2003.\par \par \uc2 Authorities say Zuniga soon became the right-hand man for Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, the cartel's boss before he was captured last year in Mexico. U.S. authorities are currently working to extradite him to the U.S.\par \par \uc2 In 2005, Zuniga was given responsibility for a stretch of the U.S-Mexico border west of Matamoros called El Control, where he worked until being promoted to Matamoros plaza boss in November 2010.\par \par \uc2 Rafael Cardenas Vela, the nephew of former cartel kingpin Osiel Cardenas Guillen, testified at a trial in September for another cartel member that Zuniga frustrated superiors during his short reign in Matamoros.\par \par \uc2 Cardenas testified that he replaced Zuniga in that post in March 2011, after Zuniga and others had robbed eight armored cars within a month, bringing a lot of attention to the area. Cardenas gave them 24 hours to get out of town.\par \par \uc2 A gun battle with rivals drove Zuniga to the U.S. in October 2011. Zuniga had called for reinforcements, but Costilla told him it would be a couple days. Zuniga decided to wait in the safety of the U.S. for the reinforcements then return to Mexico to re-engage his enemies, according to Flores' testimony Thursday.\par \par \uc2 After his arrest, Zuniga maintained contact with his co-conspirators through phone calls from jail. Flores said Zuniga made 560 phone calls in the five weeks prior to his guilty plea in January, often speaking in code to continue managing cartel business.\par \par \uc2 Zuniga's plea for forgiveness Thursday stood in stark contrast to his expansive conversations with federal agents that at times bordered on boast.\par \par \uc2 During a spontaneous conversation with agents at his arraignment in 2011, Zuniga spoke of the .38 Super pistol that was with him when he was arrested. He told agents he had paid a jeweler in Mexico $57,000 to customize the gold-plated and bejeweled handgun with "Wicho" engraved on it.\par \par \uc2 Zuniga even offered the gun as a gift to an ICE supervisor, because he said he also commanded many men, Flores testified.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Zuniga's attorney argued that his client was not the owner of the gun or the leather bag it was inside. Also in that bag were baggies of cocaine, more than $36,000 in cash, some nasal spray and packets of an erectile dysfunction medicine. Hanen overruled those objections.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130125e91p0009k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - David Morales was on a Greyhound bus near Las Cruces, N.M., when Border Patrol agents stopped the bus for a routine check.\par \par \uc2 Morales, 21, rose up and informed his fellow passengers of their rights. That, he says, landed him in detention for nine hours before immigration agents decided to cut him loose.\par \par \uc2 The experience, he says, was his inspiration for developing an app to inform undocumented people of their rights in a wide array of scenarios ranging from traffic stops by city police officers to a workplace raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\par \par \uc2 "I can't be on every bus, but I can make something that can," Morales told the Deseret News ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/SXXHxo"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/SXXHxo}}}\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 The app, Derechos Herencia, which roughly translates as "inherited rights," is available for smartphone and tablet users.\par \par \uc2 "I want to make it available to everyone who has questions about immigration," he said.\par \par \uc2 Morales, who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , spent 17 days in jail following a previous encounter with immigration agents on another bus ride when he was 19. He was en route to a Bible college in Louisiana when agents boarded the bus for a routine enforcement check.\par \par \uc2 When agents asked him if he was a U.S. citizen, Morales told them he was not, and he was held in a detention center to await deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 He was released after his family posted a $4,000 bond. He was eventually granted administrative relief, which he believes was aided by the signatures of 15,000 people who supported him.\par \par \uc2 The app has a feature to create online petitions on behalf of people facing deportation.\par \par \uc2 Two lawyers have vetted the content of the app to ensure its accuracy, Morales said. The app is intended to be an educational resource for undocumented people in advance of encounters with local, state or federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 "It's kind of like the Mexican ACLU," he said.\par \par \uc2 Morales, who plans to become a Christian minister and possibly attend law school, is also a plaintiff in the ongoing legal challenge to HB497, Utah's immigration enforcement law passed by the Legislature in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Aside from dealing with the possibility of being deported and being part of a federal court challenge over the constitutionality of a Utah law, the reality of his immigration status hit home when his grandmother died of cancer in Mexico, and he and his family members were not able to comfort her before she died or attend her funeral.\par \par \uc2 "My mom left her mother to give me and my brothers a better life," said Morales, who has lived in Utah since he was 9.\par \par \uc2 While Morales said he is optimistic that Congress will take up immigration reform, his family is much like other families in Utah. They have mixed immigration status, and different family members encounter a wide variety of challenges.\par \par \uc2 Morales' sisters are in the country illegally, but both are married to U.S. citizens. His parents are also in the country illegally, and his younger brother is a "Dreamer" -- young people brought to the United States as children by undocumented parents.\par \par \uc2 The brother of his brother-in-law was arrested at his home five years ago after slipping away from his workplace while federal agents were conducting a raid.\par \par \uc2 "That was the last time I saw him," Morales said.\par \par \uc2 "Every scenario that changes affects me in some way."\par \par \uc2 Morales said he relies on faith to endure the trials that he and his family have faced.\par \par \uc2 To followers of Jesus Christ, the questions over how to address illegal immigration boil down to this, Morales says: "Are we really doing what Christ wants us to do?"\par \par \uc2 Mostly, Morales doesn't want anyone else to endure the stress and fear of being incarcerated over an immigration matter.\par \par \uc2 He also hopes he can further understanding that people, regardless of their immigration status, have the same needs and dreams.\par \par \uc2 "At the end of the day, we are all human. We all want the same things. We want to feel welcomed, appreciated and loved," Morales said.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - A judge has been holding secret hearings in the case of the man convicted in the 2001 killing of Chandra Levy, the latest twist in a high-profile murder that went unsolved for years and captivated the public because of the intern's romantic relationship with a California congressman.\par \par \uc2 The meetings, held sporadically behind closed doors at the courthouse over the last several weeks, raise questions about what comes next in a criminal case that appeared resolved by the 2010 conviction of Ingmar Guandique. The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador is now serving a 60-year prison sentence in Levy's death, but the hearings could signal a problem with the prosecution of the case.\par \par \uc2 Authorities acknowledged they had no DNA evidence or witnesses linking Guandique to the crime, building their prosecution instead around a jailhouse informant who said Guandique had confessed behind bars that he was responsible for Levy's death. They also said the attack on Levy fit a pattern of assaults by Guandique on other female joggers in the same location where she went missing and during the same timeframe.\par \par \uc2 Guandique, who was already imprisoned for those attacks when he was accused in Levy's death in 2009, professed innocence at his sentencing hearing. His lawyers said police and prosecutors made him a scapegoat for a botched investigation.\par \par \uc2 Neither prosecutors nor defense lawyers have revealed the purpose of the meetings, which court records show have been placed under seal by a judge. Several media organizations including The Associated Press petitioned this week to open the post-conviction proceedings. The next hearing is set for Feb. 7 in D.C. Superior Court.\par \par \uc2 Bill Miller\uc2 , a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office, which is handling the case, declined to comment Friday while the case is pending. A public defender for Guandique did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the public defender's office said it was pleased the media had joined the efforts to open the court sessions and that it was separately asking the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to reverse a judge's order barring the public from the courtroom.\par \par \uc2 Levy, a 24-year-old intern for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, disappeared in May 2001 after leaving her apartment in jogging clothes. Her remains were located a year later in a heavily wooded area of Washington's Rock Creek Park.\par \par \uc2 The case captivated the public after it was revealed that the intern was romantically involved with then-U.S. Rep. Gary Condit, whose political career ultimately imploded because of the extramarital affair. Condit was grilled by investigators but eventually ruled out as a potential suspect. He testified at Guandique's trial that he had no role in Levy's disappearance or death, but evaded questions about their relationship, saying he was entitled to privacy.\par \par \uc2 No arrests were made until 2009, when the authorities seized on Guandique, who at the time was in federal prison in California for attacking other women inside Rock Creek Park.\par \par \uc2 Levy's father, \uc2 Robert Levy\uc2 , told \uc2 KGO-TV\uc2  in San Francisco that prosecutors haven't told him anything about the new court proceedings.\par \par \uc2 He called Guandique a "convicted rapist and an illegal alien," but added, "if he's innocent of murder, he shouldn't be in jail for it."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130125e91p002sh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

A look at the measure:\par \par \uc2 -- MUST BE COLORADAN: Students receiving in-state rates would have to attend a Colorado high school for at least three years preceding graduation, or receive a GED in Colorado.\par \par \uc2 -- IT WON'T COST MONEY: State estimates say the tuition change will bring Colorado colleges about $2 million next school year in additional tuition.\par \par \uc2 -- HOW MANY WILL USE IT? No one knows for sure, but state analysts project state schools will have 500 new students next school year and an additional 250 new students each year thereafter.\par \par \uc2 -- SCHOOLS CAN'T SAY NO: Last year's unsuccessful immigrant tuition measure would have allowed state colleges and universities not to extend in-state tuition to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students. This year's bill does not.\par \par \uc2 Source: Senate Bill 33, legislative fiscal analysis\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130125e91p00043\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) - An alleged manager in Mexico's Gulf drug cartel was sentenced Thursday to seven years in prison after being convicted on immigration and weapon charges in Texas.\par \par \uc2 Jose Luis Zuniga Hernandez, known as "El Wicho," managed cartel operations in Matamoros, Mexico, just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville before fleeing to the U.S. to escape enemies, federal authorities said. Zuniga pleaded guilty earlier this month to illegal re-entry and being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  possessing a firearm.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen's sentence landed between those requested by Zuniga's defense and prosecutors. The judge explained that he would not lengthen Zuniga's sentence for his involvement in the cartel, because he wasn't formally charged with that crime. But Hanen noted Zuniga's prior criminal history in the U.S. and the fact that he had a gun, cash and cocaine when arrested which made him "a serious threat to the well-being of the citizens of Texas."\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol agents arrested Zuniga and four others near the Rio Grande in October 2011. Authorities say he was carrying more than $36,000 in cash, cocaine and a gold-plated handgun with "Wicho" engraved on it.\par \par \uc2 Zuniga's lawyers had argued he was fleeing for his life. Cartel infighting has driven several members into the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Rafael Cardenas Vela, the nephew of former cartel kingpin Osiel Cardenas Guillen, testified at a trial in September for another cartel member that Zuniga frustrated superiors during his short reign in Matamoros.\par \par \uc2 Cardenas testified that he replaced Zuniga in that post in March 2011, after Zuniga and others had robbed eight armored cars within a month, bringing a lot of attention to the area. Cardenas gave them 24 hours to get out of town. Zuniga then briefly resumed control of a nearby "plaza," or area of cartel influence on the border, before fleeing after a gunfight with cartel rivals.\par \par \uc2 Zuniga was among five people arrested Oct. 26, 2011, by a Border Patrol agent after they bailed out of a black pickup truck that had triggered a sensor along a rural stretch of the Rio Grande, according to court records.\par \par \uc2 Zuniga laid out details of his participation in the cartel's marijuana distribution from Mexico into the U.S. during a three-hour interview with Homeland Security investigators that night, and he agreed to help US. Law enforcement if he were released, his former attorney wrote in court documents.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys had claimed Zuniga was coerced and told by agents he would be sent back to Mexico to face death if he didn't cooperate, and had been witness protection, visas for his family and immunity from prosecution.\par \par \uc2 Zuniga was convicted in U.S. federal court in 1990 for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, and he was deported in 1997 after serving his sentence.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130124e91o001sr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600
