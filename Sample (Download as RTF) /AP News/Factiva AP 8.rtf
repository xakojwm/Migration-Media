The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court will referee another major clash between the Obama administration and the states, this one over Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigrants. The case could add fuel to the partisan split over tough state immigration laws backed by Republicans but challenged by the administration.\par \par \uc2 Like last month's arguments over President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, the immigration case is expected to be decided at the end of June.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's arguments will focus on whether states can adopt their own immigration measures to deal with an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, or whether the federal government has almost exclusive authority in the area of immigration.\par \par \uc2 Arizona was the first of a half-dozen states to enact laws intended to drive illegal immigrants elsewhere, a policy known as "attrition by enforcement." Even where blocked by courts, these laws have already had an impact on farm fields and school classrooms as fewer immigrants showed up.\par \par \uc2 "If the federal government had been doing and would continue to do its job in securing the border here in southern Arizona, this would not be an issue. Unfortunately, they failed to do that so Arizona stepped up and said, `We want to be partners. Here's a role we think we can play,'" said Sheriff Larry Dever of Cochise County, which shares an 83.5-mile border with Mexico in the state's southeastern corner.\par \par \uc2 The administration says it has both increased border enforcement to keep people from entering illegally in the first place and picked up the pace of deportations. In its first two years, the administration deported nearly 800,000 people, far higher on a yearly basis than President George W. Bush's administration.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration sued to block the Arizona law soon after its enactment two years ago. Federal courts have refused to let four key provisions take effect: requiring police, while enforcing other laws, to question a person's immigration status if officers suspect he is in the country illegally; requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\par \par \uc2 Five states -- Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah -- have adopted variations on Arizona's law. Parts of those laws also are on hold pending the outcome of the Supreme Court case.\par \par \uc2 Civil rights groups that mounted legal challenges independent of the administration's say the laws encourage racial profiling and ethnic stereotyping. "It blurs what used to be a very bright line, that you can't stop someone and ask for papers based just on how they look," said \uc2 Anthony Romero\uc2 , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. "But the impact is on citizens as much as immigrants. It's a dragnet approach that sweeps up law-abiding American citizens based on the color of their skin or ethnic origins."\par \par \uc2 And the state laws already have had a marked effect on people's behavior, whether or not the laws ever went into force, the groups say.\par \par \uc2 In some states, crops rotted in fields for want of workers to pick them. In Alabama, where a provision required schools to check student's citizenship status, more than 2,000 students stayed home the first week the law was in effect, said Karen Tumlin, managing attorney for the National Immigration Law Center. Foreign employees, including a German Mercedes-Benz executive, have been detained or ticketed for not carrying immigration documents.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, around the time Gov. Jan Brewer signed the immigration law, lifelong Arizona resident Jim Shee twice confronted police officers who came to his car window asking to see his "papers."\par \par \uc2 Shee, 72, is of Chinese and Spanish descent. "I'm not blond-haired and blue-eyed. My grandkids aren't blond-haired and blue-eyed. I don't want to see this happening to them," Shee said.\par \par \uc2 He has joined a lawsuit filed by a coalition of civil rights groups. The suit is on hold until the high court renders a decision.\par \par \uc2 Shee said he carries his passport in case he gets stopped again.\par \par \uc2 The number of illegal immigrants in Arizona has declined by about a third in recent years, from 530,000 in 2007 to 360,000 in 2011, according to federal government estimates.\par \par \uc2 Experts have attributed the decrease to several factors, including the economic downturn, tighter border security and state immigration laws. A 2007 Arizona law, allowed to take effect last year by the Supreme Court, prohibits employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But in Arizona and elsewhere, the appetite for new immigration measures appears to have waned, in part because business leaders have objected. Arizona voters ousted Republican state Sen. Russell Pearce, the architect of the 2010 law and the driving force behind other Arizona immigration laws, in a November recall election.\par \par \uc2 "There has been a great deal of buyer's remorse in those states that have enacted Arizona-type legislation," the \uc2 ACLU\uc2 's Romero said.\par \par \uc2 The high court decision will land in the middle of a presidential campaign in which Obama has been heavily courting Latino voters and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney has been struggling to win Latino support after a drawn-out primary campaign in which he and the other GOP candidates mostly embraced a hard line to avoid accusations that they support any kind of "amnesty" for illegal immigrants living in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Justice Elena Kagan sat out last year's case and also will not take part in the new immigration case, presumably because of her work in the Obama administration. The court's conservative majority held sway in last year's 5-3 decision.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix contributed to this story.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120424e84o0017s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A bill that would allow illegal immigrants in Colorado to attend college at a discounted tuition rate is moving on in the House.\par \par \uc2 The bill is moving on to another House committee after the House Education Committee narrowly approved it Monday. The measure could run into more opposition later in the Republican-led House, where a similar measure failed last year.\par \par \uc2 The proposal would let illegal immigrants who graduate from Colorado high schools attend college at a rate lower than the out-of-state price but slightly higher than the in-state rate. The students must sign an affidavit saying they are seeking legal status.\par \par \uc2 The bill has already passed the Democratic-led Senate.\par \par \uc2 This is the sixth time Colorado lawmakers have debated the issue.\par \par \uc2 Thirteen states -- including Texas, California, Illinois and Connecticut -- have passed legislation granting in-state tuition for immigrant students, according to the \uc2 National Conference of State Legislatures\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Under this year's bill, Colorado students who are illegal immigrants would not get in-state tuition, which includes a state subsidy. An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  student attending the University of Colorado at Boulder, for example, would pay about $9,500 annually, compared with an estimated $7,700 for Colorado residents and about $28,850 for non-Colorado residents.\par \par \uc2 The proposal allows colleges and universities to decide not to participate. But many have expressed support, including the \uc2 University of Colorado\uc2 , Colorado State University and the state system of community colleges.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120424e84o000hu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc4}{\*\bkmkend toc4}\b \uc2 Arizona crackdown on illegal immigrants is next big, politically charged case at Supreme Court\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARK SHERMAN   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 988 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 April 2012\par 17:12\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court will referee another major clash between the Obama administration and the states, this one over Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigrants. The case could add fuel to the partisan split over tough state immigration laws backed by Republicans but challenged by the administration.\par \par \uc2 Like last month's arguments over President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, the immigration case is expected to be decided at the end of June.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's arguments will focus on whether states can adopt their own immigration measures to deal with an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, or whether the federal government has almost exclusive authority in the area of immigration.\par \par \uc2 Arizona was the first of a half-dozen states to enact laws intended to drive illegal immigrants elsewhere, a policy known as "attrition by enforcement." Even where blocked by courts, these laws have already had an impact on farm fields and school classrooms as fewer immigrants showed up.\par \par \uc2 "If the federal government had been doing and would continue to do its job in securing the border here in southern Arizona, this would not be an issue. Unfortunately, they failed to do that so Arizona stepped up and said, `We want to be partners. Here's a role we think we can play,'" said Sheriff Larry Dever of Cochise County, which shares an 83.5-mile border with Mexico in the state's southeastern corner.\par \par \uc2 The administration says it has both increased border enforcement to keep people from entering illegally in the first place and picked up the pace of deportations. In its first two years, the administration deported nearly 800,000 people, far higher on a yearly basis than President George W. Bush's administration.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration sued to block the Arizona law soon after its enactment two years ago. Federal courts have refused to let four key provisions take effect: requiring police, while enforcing other laws, to question a person's immigration status if officers suspect he is in the country illegally; requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\par \par \uc2 Five states -- Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah -- have adopted variations on Arizona's law. Parts of those laws also are on hold pending the outcome of the Supreme Court case.\par \par \uc2 Civil rights groups that mounted legal challenges independent of the administration's say the laws encourage racial profiling and ethnic stereotyping. "It blurs what used to be a very bright line, that you can't stop someone and ask for papers based just on how they look," said \uc2 Anthony Romero\uc2 , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. "But the impact is on citizens as much as immigrants. It's a dragnet approach that sweeps up law-abiding American citizens based on the color of their skin or ethnic origins."\par \par \uc2 And the state laws already have had a marked effect on people's behavior, whether or not the laws ever went into force, the groups say.\par \par \uc2 In some states, crops rotted in fields for want of workers to pick them. In Alabama, where a provision required schools to check student's citizenship status, more than 2,000 students stayed home the first week the law was in effect, said Karen Tumlin, managing attorney for the National Immigration Law Center. Foreign employees, including a German Mercedes-Benz executive, have been detained or ticketed for not carrying immigration documents.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, around the time Gov. Jan Brewer signed the immigration law, lifelong Arizona resident Jim Shee twice confronted police officers who came to his car window asking to see his "papers."\par \par \uc2 Shee, 72, is of Chinese and Spanish descent. "I'm not blond-haired and blue-eyed. My grandkids aren't blond-haired and blue-eyed. I don't want to see this happening to them," Shee said.\par \par \uc2 He has joined a lawsuit filed by a coalition of civil rights groups. The suit is on hold until the high court renders a decision.\par \par \uc2 Shee said he carries his passport in case he gets stopped again.\par \par \uc2 The number of illegal immigrants in Arizona has declined by about a third in recent years, from 530,000 in 2007 to 360,000 in 2011, according to federal government estimates.\par \par \uc2 Experts have attributed the decrease to several factors, including the economic downturn, tighter border security and state immigration laws. A 2007 Arizona law, allowed to take effect last year by the Supreme Court, prohibits employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But in Arizona and elsewhere, the appetite for new immigration measures appears to have waned, in part because business leaders have objected. Arizona voters ousted Republican state Sen. Russell Pearce, the architect of the 2010 law and the driving force behind other Arizona immigration laws, in a November recall election.\par \par \uc2 "There has been a great deal of buyer's remorse in those states that have enacted Arizona-type legislation," the \uc2 ACLU\uc2 's Romero said.\par \par \uc2 The high court decision will land in the middle of a presidential campaign in which Obama has been heavily courting Latino voters and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney has been struggling to win Latino support after a drawn-out primary campaign in which he and the other GOP candidates mostly embraced a hard line to avoid accusations that they support any kind of "amnesty" for illegal immigrants living in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Justice Elena Kagan sat out last year's case and also will not take part in the new immigration case, presumably because of her work in the Obama administration. The court's conservative majority held sway in last year's 5-3 decision.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix contributed to this story.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120423e84n002ij\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The number of Mexican immigrants living illegally in the U.S. has dropped significantly for the first time in decades, a dramatic shift as many illegal workers, already in the U.S. and seeing few job opportunities, return to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 An analysis of census data from the U.S. and Mexican governments details the movement to and from Mexico, a nation accounting for nearly 60 percent of the illegal immigrants in the U.S. It comes amid renewed debate over U.S. immigration policy as the Supreme Court hears arguments this week on Arizona's tough immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Roughly 6.1 million unauthorized Mexican immigrants were living in the U.S. last year, down from a peak of nearly 7 million in 2007, according to the \uc2 Pew Hispanic Center\uc2  study released Monday. It was the biggest sustained drop in modern history, believed to be surpassed in scale only by losses in the Mexican-born U.S. population during the Great Depression.\par \par \uc2 Much of the drop in illegal immigrants is due to the persistently weak U.S. economy, which has shrunk construction and service-sector jobs attractive to Mexican workers following the housing bust. But increased deportations, heightened U.S. patrols and violence along the border also have played a role, as well as demographic changes, such as Mexico's declining birth rate.\par \par \uc2 In all, the Mexican-born population in the U.S. last year -- legal and illegal -- fell to 12 million, marking an end to an immigration boom dating back to the 1970s, when foreign-born residents from Mexico stood at 760,000. The 2007 peak was 12.6 million.\par \par \uc2 Christian Ballesteros, who has been at a shelter for immigrants in Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, pointed to stiffer U.S. penalties for repeat offenders as well as brutal criminal groups that control the Mexican side of the border as reasons for the immigration decline. Ballesteros, who has been deported four times, was recently caught after hopping the border fence near Nogales, Ariz.\par \par \uc2 "The Mexican cartels are taking over, are actually being like the border patrols on this side," Ballesteros said. "They threaten them, `if you don't pay, what we're going to do is we're going to cut your head off.' That's the worst, the worst, the worst part," Ballesteros said.\par \par \uc2 After his last apprehension by U.S. authorities, Ballesteros was sent to a detention facility in Las Vegas for 2 1/2 months. He fears it could be six months if he's caught again. "You can lose money, but if you lose time there's no way you can recover that time," Ballesteros said, noting that many immigrants have families to support.\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey Passel\uc2 , a senior demographer at Pew who co-wrote the analysis, said Mexican immigration may never return to its height during the mid-decade housing and construction boom, even with the U.S. economy recovering. He cited longer-term factors such as a shrinking Mexican work force.\par \par \uc2 He noted that government data now show a clear shift among Mexican workers already in the U.S. who are returning home. He said that data is a sign that many immigrants are giving up on life in the U.S., feeling squeezed by increasing enforcement and limited opportunities that they don't see improving anytime soon.\par \par \uc2 About 1.4 million Mexicans left the U.S. between 2005 and 2010, double the number who did so a decade earlier. In the meantime, the number of Mexicans who entered the U.S. sharply fell to about 1.4 million, putting net migration from Mexico at a standstill. More recent data suggest that most of the movement is now heading back to Mexico, accounting for the drop in the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population.\par \par \uc2 During the same period, the population of authorized Mexican immigrants edged higher, from 5.6 million to 5.8 million.\par \par \uc2 Among the Mexican immigrants who leave the U.S., an estimated 5 to 35 percent are deported while the rest opt to go back voluntarily, often taking U.S.-born children with them. Those who were in the U.S. illegally and returned to Mexico also are increasingly saying they will not try to come back -- about 20 percent, compared to 7 percent in 2005.\par \par \uc2 The Pew estimates come amid heightened attention on immigration in an election year where the fast-growing Hispanic population, now making up roughly 16 percent of the U.S. population, could play a key role. Arizona's law, being challenged by the Obama administration in the Supreme Court, seeks to expand the authority of state police to ask about the immigration status of anybody they stop on the rationale that federal enforcement has largely failed.\par \par \uc2 Since Arizona's law passed in 2010, five other states -- Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah -- have passed similar measures.\par \par \uc2 Steve A. Camarota\uc2 , director of research at the \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2 , a Washington group that advocates tighter immigration policies, said the latest numbers show that immigration policies do make a difference.\par \par \uc2 "The bottom line is that immigration is not the weather. It is something that ... can be changed," he said. "The economy is worse but enforcement is also higher, making it more difficult for immigrants to get jobs in states like Arizona. They are now making new calculations and changing their views."\par \par \uc2 Other findings:\par \par \uc2 --Illegal Mexican immigrants who have stayed in the U.S. for longer periods of time are now more likely to be sent back by authorities than before. About 27 percent of immigrants sent back had resided in the U.S. for a year or more, up from 6 percent in 2005.\par \par \uc2 --Despite an increase in Border Patrol agents, apprehensions of illegal immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped sharply -- from 1 million in 2005 to 286,000 in 2011, a sign that fewer illegal immigrants are trying to enter.\par \par \uc2 --About 30 percent of all current U.S. immigrants are Mexican born, by far the most from any single country; that's down from its peak of 32 percent in 2004-2009. The next largest share comes from China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), accounting for 5 percent of the nation's 40 million foreign-born residents.\par \par \uc2 --A typical Mexican woman is projected to have an average of 2.4 children in her lifetime, compared with 7.3 children in 1960.\par \par \uc2 --By region, Mexican-born immigrants in the U.S. are mostly likely found in the West (51 percent) and South (33 percent). About 58 percent now live in California and Texas, down from 63 percent in 2000 as immigrants spread out over the past decade in search of jobs in other states.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Christopher Sherman in McAllen, Texas, contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.pewhispanic.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.pewhispanic.org/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120423e84n002fy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A bill that would allow illegal immigrants in Colorado to attend college at a discounted tuition rate is facing its first test in the state House.\par \par \uc2 The House Education Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on the bill Monday. The measure's prospects are good there, but it could run into more opposition later in the Republican-led House, where a similar measure failed last year.\par \par \uc2 The proposal would let illegal immigrants who graduate from Colorado high schools attend college at a rate lower than the out-of-state price but slightly higher than the in-state rate. The students must sign an affidavit saying they are seeking legal status.\par \par \uc2 The bill has already passed the Democratic-led Senate.\par \par \uc2 This is the sixth time Colorado lawmakers have debated the issue.\par \par \uc2 Thirteen states -- including Texas, California, Illinois and Connecticut -- have passed legislation granting in-state tuition for immigrant students, according to the \uc2 National Conference of State Legislatures\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Under this year's bill, Colorado students who are illegal immigrants would not get in-state tuition, which includes a state subsidy. An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  student attending the University of Colorado at Boulder, for example, would pay about $9,500 annually, compared with an estimated $7,700 for Colorado residents and about $28,850 for non-Colorado residents.\par \par \uc2 The proposal allows colleges and universities to decide not to participate. But many have expressed support, including the \uc2 University of Colorado\uc2 , Colorado State University and the state system of community colleges.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120423e84n001x3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) - A coalition of groups supporting immigrants has recruited teams of volunteers to help push programs they hope will add thousands of new U.S. citizens to the voter rolls in several states in time for the November presidential election.\par \par \uc2 The national push comes after Democratic President Barack Obama has failed to deliver on promised immigration reforms in his first years in office and his likely opponent, Mitt Romney, adopted harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration to win support from conservatives while campaigning for the GOP nomination.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Homeland Security says an estimated 12.6 million people were holding so-called green cards given to legal permanent U.S. residents in 2010, including 8.1 million people who already qualify for naturalization but have not applied for citizenship. Latinos, considered a Democratic-leaning constituency, account for the largest immigrant community.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants and other minority voters helped Obama to a comfortable win over Republican John McCain in the 2008 presidential election.\par \par \uc2 "The fastest growing segment of the American electorate is the Latino vote, and within Latinos, we are seeing very rapid growth of immigrant voters," said Matt Barreto, a political science professor at the University of Washington. "In the 2012 election there is no doubt that the immigrant community will be incredibly relevant."\par \par \uc2 The "Become a Citizen Now!" campaign began in March, hoping to help 5,000 immigrants complete the daunting application process to become citizens and register to vote. It is targeting foreign-born residents who have been in the country long enough to qualify for naturalization in Massachusetts, New York, California, Florida, Maryland, Oregon, Colorado, Washington, Tennessee, Illinois, Wisconsin and New Hampshire. Nearly 500 citizenship applications have been completed so far.\par \par \uc2 Yenith Berrio, a 40-year-old Colombian citizen who has spent half of her life living in the United States, is preparing for her naturalization test and looks forward to becoming a U.S. citizen and registered voter.\par \par \uc2 The Boston resident said the right to vote allows her to participate in a process that affects her and her family. She said the U.S. is a better place for her and her children who "are happier right here and could get much better education here."\par \par \uc2 It typically takes just over five months to acquire citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "Those immigrants that apply for their citizenship before the end of April are likely to be able to vote in this election in November," said Josh Hoyt, a co-chair of the National Partnership for New Americans.\par \par \uc2 A separate push by the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization, seeks to register 180,000 Latinos to vote nationwide. Organizers say the initiative already has registered more than 10,000 voters. The group is conducting the campaign in Florida, Nevada, Colorado, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, California, Texas, North Carolina and online.\par \par \uc2 When immigrants register, they generally show up to vote. More than 89 percent of registered foreign-born Americans cast ballots in 2008, according to the \uc2 Pew Hispanic Center\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And their share among voters is growing. Among all voters who cast ballots in the 1996 presidential election, 4.1 percent were foreign-born, according to Pew. Eight years later in 2008, the percentage rose to 6.3.\par \par \uc2 While Immigrants have historically supported candidates in both major political parties, there's been a recent shift toward Democrats, said Manuel Pastor, director of the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration at the University of Southern California.\par \par \uc2 "There has been sort of a noticeable spin in the last couple of elections toward the Democratic party -- but it seems mostly because of the way most of the Republican Party has moved right on immigration and the impact that has on the perception of new immigrant voters." Pastor said.\par \par \uc2 Romney has staked out a tough stance on immigration. He favors a U.S.-Mexico border fence, opposes education benefits to illegal immigrants and says he would veto the Dream Act, which would allow some \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youths to earn permanent residency and eventually citizenship if they attend college or serve in the military.\par \par \uc2 Obama had promised during his 2008 campaign to press for a comprehensive immigration policy overhaul that would include providing a path to legalization for millions of illegal immigrants. Yet, more than three years into his term, he has failed to deliver, blaming fiercely divided congressional Republicans who he says are unwilling to work on the issue.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/ngowi"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/ngowi}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120421e84l00234\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

While the stadium bill still faces a long haul in the waning days of Minnesota's legislative session, the committee's vote gave the $975 million stadium proposal new life four days after a companion bill's defeat in a House committee sparked near panic among supporters.\par \par \uc2 "We're very pleased with the progress and that the bill moved forward," Lester Bagley, the Vikings' vice president for stadium development, said after the Senate committee vote. "It's been an up and down week, touch and go."\par \par \uc2 The setback in the House had prompted the visit Friday by Goodell. He and Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney II met Friday morning with Gov. Mark Dayton and legislative leaders to stress the urgency of resolving the Vikings' decadelong pursuit of a replacement for the Metrodome.\par \par \uc2 Though the Vikings will play next season in the dome, their lease there has expired. That has raised fears the franchise could get snatched by Los Angeles or another city seeking its own football team -- a prospect Goodell did not exactly squelch.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Minn. panel sends Cap fix-up back to House floor\par \par \uc2 ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A plan to restore the state Capitol building may get a second life after failing by one vote in the Minnesota House Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The House Ways and Means committee sent a bill to the House floor Friday with an amendment that combines the $221 million Capitol restoration plan with a bare-bones version of the House's general construction projects bill. Altogether the package comes to $434 million.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Larry Howes says that he made the move in a last-ditch effort to restore the Capitol. Some Democrats on and off the committee were concerned that provisions for general projects around the state were very limited, especially in the metro area.\par \par \uc2 Howes says that he doesn't believe it will pass off the House floor.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Minn. man accused of transporting illegal workers\par \par \uc2 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A 46-year-old St. Peter man indicted on charges of transporting and harboring illegal immigrants had allegedly provided larger poultry companies in Minnesota with some of his workers, according to a federal affidavit.\par \par \uc2 Juan Arrazolo was charged this week with one count of transporting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and one count of harboring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , both for his own financial gain.\par \par \uc2 Arrazolo operates a business called Poultry Services Management, which provides labor to various poultry farms. The work includes "trimming beaks, vaccinating chickens, and similar duties," according to the affidavit by Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Charles Bautch.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Attorney's Office said Arrazolo provided workers for large corporate poultry farms in Minnesota and the surrounding area.

(AP) -- A top Republican has bowed to public pressure and released a confidential legal arrangement to defend the Minnesota Senate in a high-level scandal involving the former majority leader.\par \par \uc2 Current Senate Majority Leader David Senjem released the letter of representation Friday evening. The January letter shows the agreed-upon rate for Minneapolis attorney Dayle Nolan is $330 per hour.\par \par \uc2 Senjem and others had refused public access to the private attorney's billing plans. But in a statement Friday, Senjem says they decided to release the letter after consulting with the secretary of the Senate and attorneys.\par \par \uc2 Nolan is handling legal matters related to former leader Amy Koch's extramarital affair with a top aide, who has threatened to sue the Senate over his firing.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120421e84l0009v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - The Alabama House has passed a bill that makes some changes to the state's immigration law in response to complaints from some who said the law infringed on some civil liberties.\par \par \uc2 The bill passed Thursday evening on a 64-34 vote and now goes to the Senate for debate.\par \par \uc2 The legislation makes changes to the law that supporters and opponents have called the toughest crackdown on illegal immigrants in the nation. The vote mostly broke along party lines with Republicans voting for it and Democrats voting "no."\par \par \uc2 The sponsor, Republican Rep. Micky Hammon of Decatur, said the changes were aimed at removing confusing language and making the law easier to enforce.\par \par \uc2 Changes included giving a judge the option to suspend a business that hires illegal immigrants for up to 60 days instead of the 10 days in the current law.\par \par \uc2 Religious leaders had complained about a section of the law that that made it a crime to provide or lodging or shelter to a known \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The new law adds language that says the law would not prevent a church or church-affiliated organization from ministering to or providing help to all individuals regardless of immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Hammon said the bill does not make massive changes to the immigration law it just clarifies certain sections.\par \par \uc2 "If we have a law that is confusing, it won't be enforced. I feel like we are going to have a stronger law and a more enforceable law," Hammon said.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the immigration law argued that it needed to be repealed and not rewritten.\par \par \uc2 "There is nothing about this that makes it okay," Democratic Rep. Patricia Todd of Birmingham said of the changes the bill would make to the immigration law. ""We are a country based on immigration."\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers debated the bill for more than five hours before deciding shortly before 5 p.m. to cut off debate. A vote was delayed for about an hour so that the 83-page bill could be read at length.\par \par \uc2 The debate was sometimes emotional and lasted throughout the day\par \par \uc2 At one point more than 70 protesters gathered in the hallway outside the House Chamber on the fifth floor of the Alabama Statehouse. The protesters sang songs in Spanish, prayed and urged legislators to repeal the immigration law.\par \par \uc2 One protester, Nancy Santillan, said she left Mexico because she could not find a job and provide for her daughter, who was 2-year-old at the time. She said she came across the border holding her daughter in her arms.\par \par \uc2 "We want it to be removed," Santillan said of the immigration law.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120420e84k00071\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Micky Hammon of Decatur. It addresses some concerns of critics to the immigration law, which was adopted by the Legislature last year.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Federal officials are making an Air Force base near San Antonio the temporary home of 100 unescorted children stopped by the U.S. Border Patrol because a network of contracted shelters is overwhelmed with more kids than it can accommodate.\par \par \uc2 The first of the children arrived at Lackland Air Force Base on Monday, the San Antonio Express-News ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/J7LGNk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/J7LGNk}}}\uc2 ) reported. The children, apprehended at different times and locations, are under the charge of the Unaccompanied Children's Services division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\par \par \uc2 Lackland spokesman Brent Boller tells the newspaper that the base is "simply providing the temporary housing" in an unused 1,000-student dorm with showers and a dining hall.\par \par \uc2 HHS has taken in 7,000 to 8,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children in each of the past three years, but sheltered more than 4,000 since October. It has seen a 77 percent jump in the number of children in the first quarter of 2012.\par \par \uc2 "All anyone can do is speculate about what's going on," Lavinia Limon, president of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, told the Express-News.\par \par \uc2 The children have been distributed among 10 states, where they receive government-provided housing, health care and psychiatric treatment. Nearly 9 of every 10 immigrant children are reunited with their families.\par \par \uc2 Unaccompanied children are not housed in immigrant detention centers, Linda Brandmiller, immigration services director for Catholic Charities in San Antonio.\par \par \uc2 Two-thirds of the children are from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, while 12 percent are from Mexico. About 80 percent are boys, with 83 percent being older than 14.\par \par \uc2 Half of the children crossing the border are caught by the Border Patrol, Limon said. Most of those contacting her organization for help say they fled forced recruitment into gangs or prostitution, she said.\par \par \uc2 "The children are recruited quite early and it is very difficult for them to resist, and so the ones who don't want to be part of those kinds of activities take off," she said.\par \par \uc2 Organizations that receive government grants to care for the children at their own shelters will also oversee their care at Lackland, according to a statement from HHS.\par \par \uc2 "HHS appreciates the collaboration, cooperation and assistance of (the Department of Defense), (Department of Homeland Security) and state and local officials," the statement said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120417e84h000kw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  children seeking a more affordable path to college will soon get an answer from Colorado lawmakers on an issue that has divided them for years: Should the students pay roughly the same tuition as legal state residents?\par \par \uc2 The debate centers on what to do about immigrants like Claudia Trejo, a 17-year-old Denver high school student who has been in the state education system since she was 11.\par \par \uc2 "I would say I consider Colorado my home," said Trejo, who came to Denver illegally with her family from the Mexican state of Chihuahua.\par \par \uc2 The challenge for students such as Trejo, who wants to be a teacher, is out-of-state tuition can be up to five times more expensive than in-state rates. Trejo said her family can't afford the difference.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the bill before the Legislature argue that it rewards behavior that should be punished, and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students will find it hard to get a job because of their status, even if they get a college education.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic-led Senate passed a bill this month that provides discounted tuition for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who graduate from a Colorado high school after at least three years of attendance. The proposal, which had no support from Senate Republicans, is pending before the GOP-controlled House Education Committee.\par \par \uc2 Advocates of the measure are encouraged by comments from the panel's chairman, Rep. Tom Massey, R-Poncha Springs. While he stopped short of promising to vote yes for the bill, he said he's sympathetic to the issue.\par \par \uc2 "I'm going to listen to both sides, but I'm very supportive of the concept, and it's time we actually address this segment of the population," Massey said.\par \par \uc2 Massey's committee is set to hear the bill on April 23.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Massey was among Republican lawmakers on the same committee who rejected a similar bill after an emotional hearing attended by immigrant high school students wearing T-shirts reading, "Future Lawyer" and "Future Social Worker."\par \par \uc2 This is the sixth time Colorado lawmakers have debated the issue.\par \par \uc2 Thirteen states -- including Texas, California, Illinois and Connecticut -- have passed legislation granting in-state tuition for immigrant students, according to the \uc2 National Conference of State Legislatures\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Under this year's bill, Colorado students would not get in-state tuition, which includes a state subsidy. For example, with the proposed discounted tuition category, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  student attending the \uc2 University of Colorado at Boulder\uc2  would pay about $9,500 annually, compared with an estimated $7,700 for Colorado residents and about $28,850 for non-Colorado residents.\par \par \uc2 The proposal allows colleges and universities to decide not to participate. But many have expressed support, including the \uc2 University of Colorado\uc2 , Colorado State University and the state system of community colleges.\par \par \uc2 But even if the bill passes Massey's committee, it must still be heard by another committee where it could be voted down by majority Republicans who widely oppose the proposal.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Chris Holbert, R-Parker, a member of the Education Committee, said his constituents are against the idea. His main concern is the students' legal status.\par \par \uc2 "If we have a student who's attended high school, and they're not a citizen, that person doesn't have a Social Security number," Holbert said. "And graduating them from an in-state institution at any level of tuition puts them back in society without a Social Security number. And I think that that's an issue that we need to address clearly before we start talking about what tuition we charge them."\par \par \uc2 The bill includes a requirement that students who take advantage of the discounted tuition rate sign an affidavit affirming they are seeking, or will seek, legal status.\par \par \uc2 "I certainly like that," Holbert said. But he added, "I don't know what the repercussions are if that process is not completed."\par \par \uc2 Supporters are moving forward with the proposal despite past setbacks.\par \par \uc2 "Eventually, this bill is going to pass. I believe that very strongly," said Rep. Crisanta Duran, D-Denver, who is sponsoring the bill in the House. "Because you can't tell all of these kids who are in this country due to no fault of their own that they should not have access to the American Dream."\par \par \uc2 Trejo, a senior at Bruce Randolph School, knows what she'll do if the bill doesn't pass.\par \par \uc2 "I will spend my summer registering people to vote and making sure they vote Nov. 6," she said. "Because I think if we can get enough people to vote, we can create a change in our government."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Find Ivan Moreno on Twitter: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/IvanJourno"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/IvanJourno}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Senate Bill 15: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://goo.gl/kSTZb"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://goo.gl/kSTZb}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120417e84h001sy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CRETE, Ill. (AP) - A gateway between Chicago's suburbs and downstate farm country, the small village of Crete is old-fashioned and proud of it. Patriotic bunting adorns its stately homes downtown. The local barber brags that he's never had a phone to interrupt the conversation in his 80-year-old shop.\par \par \uc2 So emotions ran high when federal officials began eyeballing a farm field on the outskirts of town for a nearly 800-bed detention facility for illegal immigrants slated for deportation. The mayor embraced the prospect of new jobs, but some residents bristled at the notion of becoming a prison town and put up anti-detention center signs in their front lawns.\par \par \uc2 While Chicago's immigrant rights advocates joined local opponents in the usual protests, they also turned to a more unique tactic that hasn't been tried where such immigration jails are located: They persuaded the Democratic leaders of President Barack Obama's home state to try banning Crete from working with private contractors on the project.\par \par \uc2 Illinois law already prohibits the state and municipalities from using private companies to run prisons; the proposed ban amends that policy to add detention centers. It sailed through the Illinois Senate and could come up for a House vote as early as this week. Gov. Pat Quinn, a supporter of immigrant friendly legislation, has signaled he's no fan of the jail project either.\par \par \uc2 "The state of Illinois is going to extreme measures to make sure this doesn't happen," said Crete Village President Michael Einhorn, who's led the community 35 miles south of Chicago for decades.\par \par \uc2 Einhorn had hoped the center, slated to be built and operated by a company called \uc2 Corrections Corporation of America\uc2  -- among the largest private U.S. corrections company -- could bring hundreds of jobs and tax revenue to the community of about 8,000. But he now has his doubts it'll ever see the light of day.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials have promoted the detention centers as additional jail space that offers a new, more humane approach for incarcerating low-risk detainees. The plans come amid a record number of deportations, around 400,000 a year during Obama's term.\par \par \uc2 A gleaming flagship center opened just last month in South Texas -- a 608-bed prison with dormitory-style rooms and private phones. Texas lawmakers didn't object, though conservatives blasted it as going too far in coddling criminals. More jail space for immigrant detainees awaiting deportation was approved in California and New Jersey, where contract bidding became an issue but didn't stop the project.\par \par \uc2 Currently, another proposal for a 1,500-bed facility near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is being protested by local residents and immigrant rights advocates, who've even argued that it needed an environmental review because of its proximity to the Everglades. But there the project has gained momentum with support from top lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 None has been jeopardized as seriously as the plan in Illinois, which has some of the most immigrant-friendly policies in the nation. Democratic U.S. Reps. Luis Gutierrez and Jesse Jackson Jr. have joined unions and some local residents in raising concerns about monitoring the work of private contractors and a lack of transparency.\par \par \uc2 "If the government wanted to open up additional cells, then let the government do it," said state Sen. Tony Munoz, a Chicago Democrat who sponsored the ban. "Why are we bringing in a private company?"\par \par \uc2 Munoz questions \uc2 Corrections Corporation of America\uc2 's record of inmate treatment. The company also has come under criticism by groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which alleges that private companies base their profit strategies on trying to maintain high levels of incarceration.\par \par \uc2 CCA spokesman \uc2 Steve Owen\uc2  said the Tennessee-based company has had a proven track record with the federal government for more than three decades and operates more than a dozen facilities contracted with ICE.\par \par \uc2 "It's certainly concerning," Owen said of the Illinois legislation. "People need to take a pause and consider the potential opportunity that this presents, what amounts to economic development at a time when jobs are greatly needed or revenue is greatly needed."\par \par \uc2 In a statement, ICE officials called the Crete facility "another important step in the agency's long-term effort to reform the immigration detention system." They declined an interview, citing a policy of not commenting on pending legislation.\par \par \uc2 First word of the proposed facility emerged in late 2010 when \uc2 CCA\uc2  approached village officials on behalf of ICE about the vacant parcel. The selling point was up to 250 jobs and an estimated $1.2 million in property tax revenue each year, attractive to a community contemplating cuts to police and municipal services.\par \par \uc2 But the protests began as soon as the proposal became public. Led by churches and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, activists marched 35 miles to the site from Chicago and flooded village council meetings. Signs saying "Crete Detention Center" with a red line through it have been placed in lawns throughout Crete.\par \par \uc2 The jail is a lively topic of conversation inside Al's Barber Shop, the family business that boasts of never allowing a phone on premises. "It doesn't seem like it would belong here," said 24-year-old barber Alexander Skoutaris.\par \par \uc2 Linda Bennett, 56, who runs a daycare, questions if the jobs would really go to Crete residents. She wants existing prisons to be used, especially with a state proposal to close two of them.\par \par \uc2 "Why take fertile farmland? Use a building already in existence," she said.\par \par \uc2 But her downstairs neighbor, Robert Zola, disagrees. "We need work," said the 30-year-old.\par \par \uc2 If the measure passes the legislature and the planned jail is blocked, ICE officials have the option of building one with government funds, but that is unlikely, especially with the current federal budget problems. The privately operated jails were part of an ICE effort to find an alternative that would save money.\par \par \uc2 The other option would be to shift focus to a nearby state like Indiana or Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Sophia Tareen can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/sophiatareen"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/sophiatareen}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120414e84e001is\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DALLAS (AP) - A Dallas suburb that has tried to ban housing rents by illegal immigrants will continue its appeals court fight for the ban, an attorney for the city said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge in Dallas had blocked Farmers Branch from implementing a city ordinance barring illegal immigrants from renting and penalizing landlords who rent to them. Last month, a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower-court ruling.\par \par \uc2 Now, Farmers Branch has decided to appeal the ruling to the full New Orleans-based appeals court, Kris Kobach, an attorney for the city, told The Associated Press on Thursday. Koback said he expects the whole court to grant a review and uphold the law based on previous court rulings.\par \par \uc2 "The entire court will have difficulty swallowing the analysis of the two judges in the majority," said Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and an advocate for tougher anti-illegal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Farmers Branch has spent nearly $5 million on immigration-related lawsuits, mostly over a city ordinance that would bar illegal immigrants from renting and penalize landlords that rent to them.\par \par \uc2 "Litigation like this is very front-loaded," Kobach said.\par \par \uc2 The fight has pushed Farmers Branch, a quiet collection of bedroom communities and office parks, into the national debate about illegal immigration. Local Latinos say it also has made U.S. citizens and legal immigrants feel unwelcome in the city, where the Latino population has fallen in recent years.\par \par \uc2 City officials and law backers argue that illegal immigrants strain local schools and police resources. They also note that local voters supported an early version of the law five years ago by a 2-to-1 margin.\par \par \uc2 Farmers Branch's City Council, which has never included a Latino, has in recent years declared English to be the city's official language and resisted efforts to shift voting from an at-large system, which Latinos say dilutes their voice. The council first passed a rental ban in 2006, but replaced it two years later on the advice of its attorneys.\par \par \uc2 The new law would require all renters to obtain a city license and the city's building inspector to check the status of any applicant who wasn't a U.S. citizen. Illegal immigrants would be denied a renter's permit, and landlords who knowingly allowed them to stay could have their renter's license barred.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge put that law on hold after landlords and renters sued the city, and courts have continued to block it -- most recently on Wednesday by the 5th Circuit.\par \par \uc2 Similar bans pushed in other cities, most notably Fremont, Neb., and Hazleton, Pa., are in the middle of similar court fights.\par \par \uc2 A judge recently allowed Fremont to require renters to obtain a permit but stopped the city from revoking the permits if renters were found to be illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Hazleton's law, which would sanction business owners for employing illegal immigrants and property owners for renting to them, also is on hold. But backers will get a new hearing because the Supreme Court last year, citing its decision in another case, vacated a federal appeals court's ruling against the law.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120413e84d0004t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Her boyfriends beat him, he said.\par \par \uc2 Eventually he found refuge with an offshoot of the MS-13 gang called 20th Street, and later the Pasadena Locos Surenos.\par \par \uc2 According to prosecutors, Ramos opened fire on a car carrying Tony Bologna, 48, and his three sons -- Michael, Matthew and Andrew -- in June 2008, after spotting them in traffic and mistaking one of them for a rival gang member. Tony Bologna was killed, as well as 20-year-old Michael and 16-year-old Matthew.\par \par \uc2 Ramos maintains he was only driving the car and that his passenger, Wilfredo Reyes, unexpectedly opened fire. Defense lawyer Marla Zamora, has argued that her client was set up by the federal government and the MS-13 gang to take the fall for the shooting.\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the trial, the lone survivor, Andrew Bologna, testified that Ramos appeared to be the only person inside the car and that he saw him pull out a gun during the encounter at an intersection in San Francisco's Excelsior District.\par \par \uc2 The case drew attention to the city's sanctuary policy because Ramos, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was never turned over for deportation despite previous run-ins with the law as a juvenile.\par \par \uc2 Under a controversial loophole, illegal immigrants charged with crimes as minors were not handed over to federal immigration officials but instead flown home or housed in California at the city's expense. The city has since closed that loophole.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120409e849002p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Dem Senate hopeful seeks immigration law fix\b0\par\par\uc2 By BOB SALSBERG   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 643 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 April 2012\par 17:17\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - A federal immigration law mandating that fingerprints taken from crime suspects by local law enforcement officials be turned over to the FBI creates barriers between police and immigrant communities and should be improved before being fully implemented next year, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren said Monday.\par \par \uc2 Warren, a Harvard law professor and consumer advocate, was asked about the Secure Communities law after appearing at a Statehouse event sponsored by the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, or MIRA, which calls itself New England's largest organization promoting the rights of immigrants and refugees.\par \par \uc2 Under the Secure Communities program, the FBI would share a crime suspect's fingerprint information with the Department of Homeland Security. If it appeared that the crime suspect was in the United States illegally, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, could initiate deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Sen. Scott Brown and other state Republicans have targeted Warren's positions on immigration issues in recent days. Brown is seeking re-election after winning the seat in a 2010 special election to succeed to the late Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy.\par \par \uc2 Brown has stated that Warren opposes Secure Communities. But the Democrat has crafted a more nuanced position, saying she believe the FBI and ICE should be allowed to share information that would help remove dangerous criminals from the streets. But she also has said that many community leaders and some law enforcement officials have expressed reservations about the program as currently designed.\par \par \uc2 "There are many who are worried that the way it is directed right now ... it doesn't focus on violent offenders and it builds walls between communities and those who police them," Warren told reporters on Monday. "And it's very important in order to have truly safe communities that the police and the communities are working closely and have ongoing relationships that are deep and lasting and based on trust."\par \par \uc2 Critics of Secure Communities, including some police officials, worry that it will lead to greater mistrust of law enforcement and discourage some immigrants from reporting crime or assisting in criminal investigations.\par \par \uc2 "What Secure Communities does is actually make communities less secure," said Marisa DeFranco, an immigration attorney from Middleton who also is seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate and appeared at Monday's advocacy event.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants, even if legal, "are not going to come forward as witnesses in crime or help police if a crime has been committed because even if they are documented, someone in their family isn't," she said.\par \par \uc2 DeFranco accused Brown of being "uninformed" on immigration issues but also criticized Warren for not taking stronger stands on Secure Communities and other issues.\par \par \uc2 Brown met last week with three Republican Massachusetts sheriffs who have called on the state to adopt Secure Communities immediately. Proponents have pointed to several incidents they say could have been prevented had the law been in place, including the death in Milford last August of a motorcyclist who police said was struck and dragged by a pickup truck driven by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was drunk and did not have a license.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Massachusetts Republican Party\uc2  also last week released an online video targeting Warren's opposition to a border fence, her support for in-state tuition for illegal immigrants and her support of the DREAM Act, a proposal to offer young illegal immigrants paths to citizenship through college education or military service.\par \par \uc2 Warren responded on Monday: "I believe people who are in the United States who do not have legal status through no fault of their own, who were brought here as children, and they want either to serve in the military or better themselves through higher education and help make this a more prosperous country should be encouraged to do that."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120409e8490028h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Nebraska lawmakers have a list of accomplishments to look back on as the Legislature lurches toward adjournment, but the session could be remembered as much for confrontations with the governor as for legislative action.\par \par \uc2 With three days left in the 60-day session, lawmakers have finished most of their priorities, including new investments in university medical research, an overhaul of child welfare services, and a tax-cut package aimed at low- and middle-income Nebraskans.\par \par \uc2 But in nearly every major policy decision this year, lawmakers have openly challenged Republican Gov. Dave Heineman, and he's often responded strongly to their complaints.\par \par \uc2 Several times this session, Heineman has singled out individual state senators for criticism, most notably last week when he held a news conference to criticize Speaker Mike Flood, a Republican from Norfolk. If Flood gets his way, Heineman complained the session could be tarnished by tax increases and giveaways to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 After repeated confrontations with lawmakers, Heineman was clearly exasperated last week by two bills that lawmakers passed over his objections. He said he was "extraordinarily disappointed" with Flood for supporting both measures, one of which would extend prenatal care to pregnant women in the country illegally, and another allowing cities to raise sales taxes with voter approval.\par \par \uc2 In his weekly address to Nebraskans, Heineman repeated his opposition to the prenatal care bill and urged residents to contact their local lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 "If an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is residing in one of the 36 states that do not offer benefits to illegals, this will incent and encourage illegal immigrants to come to Nebraska -- forcing you, the hard-working, legal citizens of our state, to pay for public benefits for them," he said. "That is not fair and it is not right."\par \par \uc2 Heineman said the Nebraska Department of Labor has stopped more than $1.9 million in taxpayer dollars from going to illegal immigrants who tried to file for state unemployment benefits. More than half of the claims were filed in the last two years, which saved $632,000 last year alone, he said.\par \par \uc2 Omaha Sen. Heath Mello, a Democrat and frequent Heineman critic, said lawmakers took the lead this year on the session's most pressing issues: Funding for \uc2 University of Nebraska\uc2  medical center projects, an overhaul of privately managed child services, reimbursement for unpaid child welfare providers, prenatal care coverage for illegal immigrants, and the governor's tax-cut package.\par \par \uc2 "You have five key issues where the Legislature has ultimately stepped in," Mello said. "In the previous four years I've been here, we've never seen so many significant issues where the Legislature has differed from the governor and ultimately took the lead."\par \par \uc2 A message left Friday with Heineman's office was not returned.\par \par \uc2 Mello said lawmakers offered less resistance to the governor in the past because of term limits, which started forcing seasoned lawmakers out of office in 2006. He said new lawmakers, including himself, have since gained experience and were more willing to challenge the governor on his early plans for a deeper tax cut, which many senators viewed as unaffordable.\par \par \uc2 Heineman's original tax package called for $327 million in tax relief over a three-year period, but lawmakers stripped it down to $97 million.\par \par \uc2 "I think most people, including myself, would agree that we don't have the acrimony that Washington has when it comes to trying to solve the state's problems," Mello said. "And this year, when there were disagreements, the Legislature moved forward in the way that people felt we needed to move forward."\par \par \uc2 Legislators also approved child welfare bills that would limit caseloads for state workers, increase pay for foster parents and create a state Children's Commission, among other steps.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers also proposed new medical construction projects for the \uc2 University of Nebraska\uc2 , which Heineman initially opposed.\par \par \uc2 The approved state budget package includes $50 million from the cash reserve for a \uc2 University of Nebraska Medical Center\uc2  cancer research tower, and $15 million for a nursing college in Kearney. It also spends $6.1 million in general-fund dollars for a Veterinary Diagnostic Center in Lincoln.\par \par \uc2 "It's been a tough session," said Valentine Sen. Deb Fischer, a Republican who agrees with Heineman on both the sales tax and prenatal care bills. "It's been an emotional session. We've had a lot of big issues, regardless of whether they passed or not. We've had a lot of late nights, and people's nerves are on edge."\par \par \uc2 Flood declined to comment about his relationship with the governor, saying he would only speak about state policy. He said he has always tried to stay civil with fellow policy makers when they disagree.\par \par \uc2 "It doesn't mean I agree with what they're doing on a bill, but there are senators in there who are doing what they think is right," Flood said. "This places works best when you respect that."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120408e848001gy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS (AP) - Nevada Republicans are courting Latino voters, but they aren't softening their anti-illegal immigration rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, U.S. Sen. Dean Heller and U.S. Rep. Joe Heck have met with members of a Las Vegas Hispanic group only to affirm their opposition to immigration reform policies supported by many Latino voters.\par \par \uc2 Heller and Heck both told the Hispanics in Politics group that they oppose the DREAM Act, which seeks to create a path toward citizenship for some illegal immigrants who complete college or join the military.\par \par \uc2 Heller and Heck also said they want to overhaul the 14th Amendment so that some children of illegal immigrants will no longer be granted automatic citizenship at birth.\par \par \uc2 "What I said was I think we need to visit the area of birthright citizenship," Heck said Wednesday during his meeting with the group. He noted that most developed countries require one or both parents to be citizens.\par \par \uc2 Some Hispanics are applauding Heller and Heck's straight talk. Latinos voters are an increasingly important demographic after Nevada's Hispanic population grew to 26.5 percent in 2010, according to census data. Latino voters represented 9 percent of the electorate in 2010.\par \par \uc2 "Democrats have been engaging the community for a longer time with a sustained effort, and Republicans now are realizing they have to do that," said Jennifer Sevilla Korn, executive director of the Hispanic Leadership Network, a national conservative group. "Just because you're a Republican or a conservative, you can't be afraid to go into the community just because there might be some disagreement."\par \par \uc2 But critics argue that merely meeting Latinos on their own turf won't win voters. Many Hispanics won't vote for someone who wants to deport their cousin or uncle, they said.\par \par \uc2 "The Republican playbook has determined that taking a tough stance on immigration is not going to hurt them," said Andres Ramirez, a Democratic consultant. "They are trying to show there is a conservative movement of Latinos who want to work with Republicans. But they are certainly not adding new people to their fold."\par \par \uc2 Fernando Romero, president of Hispanics in Politics, said Heller and Heck's visits to the group marked the first time Republican candidates embraced tough immigration policies in front of its largely Democratic membership.\par \par \uc2 "Normally, they are less aggressive," Romero said.\par \par \uc2 Some Hispanics are concerned that the group is being used by Republicans who want to seem friendly toward that community. But Romero said he appreciated that the candidates didn't try to pretend they were pro-immigration reform when their records indicate otherwise.\par \par \uc2 "I certainly take my hat off to them for doing that and for giving us credit for not being stupid," he said.\par \par \uc2 But honesty won't be enough to sway voters, Romero said.\par \par \uc2 "Someone is giving them wrong advice: `Face them and by the mere fact that you addressed the group, they will give you a vote or two,'" Romero said.\par \par \uc2 Heck's spokesman said he isn't new to the Hispanic community. He has previously advertised on Spanish-language television and met with the Latin Chamber of Commerce in Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 His likely general election opponent, Assembly Speaker John Oceguera, has Hispanic ancestry.\par \par \uc2 Heller has promised to meet with some Hispanic leaders to draft immigration reform legislation.\par \par \uc2 His likely general election rival, U.S. Rep. Shelley Berkley, represents the congressional district with the state's largest Hispanic population. She has met regularly with Hispanic groups and advocated for the DREAM Act.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120408e8480002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Legislation being pushed by the governor and other Republican leaders to revise Alabama's immigration law addresses some of the concerns raised by religious leaders, but it doesn't go far enough to erase their belief that the state is trying to keep them from following the biblical commandment to look after "the least of these."\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. Micky Hammon of Decatur introduced the bill in the House on Thursday with the support of Gov. Robert Bentley, House Speaker Mike Hubbard, Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh and other key leaders. It came after the law, signed by the governor in June 2011, drew criticism from religious leaders, law enforcement and business groups for being unclear and unworkable.\par \par \uc2 The governor's legal adviser, Cooper Shattuck, said the changes should alleviate many concerns about religious organizations getting into trouble for ministering, providing food or offering other services to illegal immigrants. He said the changes clarify that religious organizations don't have to verify the legal residency of people they serve, and that they won't get into trouble for having an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in ministry or mission work, as long as the person is not paid as an employee.\par \par \uc2 Shattuck said another change clarifies language on when a violation occurs. The new language says someone must conceal, harbor or shield a person from detection while knowing the person is in the country illegally or with reckless disregard to the person's status.\par \par \uc2 "These changes go a long way to address their legitimate concerns," Shattuck said.\par \par \uc2 The Rev. Angie Wright from the Beloved Community United Church of Christ in Birmingham said the changes don't go far enough and in some cases make the law harsher. That includes levying a felony punishment for aiding five illegal immigrants, when the current law provides for aiding 10 or more.\par \par \uc2 "It is deeply disturbing to me, especially during Holy Week, that legislators have shown no remorse for the massive suffering caused by HB56," she said, referring to the bill number for the law.\par \par \uc2 Wright is an organizer of Faith Leaders for a Welcoming Alabama, which is running TV ads criticizing the law. She said the proposed changes won't stop criticism because even if the changes are enacted, the law will still interfere with the role of churches by creating fear in immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 "This is the work of the Lord -- looking after the least of these," she said.\par \par \uc2 Kitty Rogers Brown, an attorney for Episcopal Bishop Henry Parsley Jr. of the Diocese of Alabama, said Friday the revision legislation is a sign that state officials are listening to religious leaders' concerns. "But it does not go far enough," she said.\par \par \uc2 Brown said some of the changes appear to offer protection to church leaders, but the wording of the bill makes her concerned the protection is not extended to church members.\par \par \uc2 Brown represents Parsley in his suit where he joined Roman Catholic and Methodist church leaders in challenging the law. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta is waiting on a U.S Supreme Court ruling on Arizona's immigration law before ruling on the challenges to Alabama's law.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120406e84600195\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Weber admitted lying to an agent of the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agent was inquiring about an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who worked for Weber's concrete business.\par \par \uc2 Officials say Weber told the agent in February 2010 that the worker had been laid off about two months earlier and that Weber had not talked to the worker since. Officials say that, in fact, the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was still working for Weber and had talked to Weber that same day.\par \par \uc2 The worker fled and avoided apprehension by immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 Weber's sentencing date has not been set.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120406e846000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - The author of Alabama's tough immigration law offered revisions Thursday that modify some sections put on hold by the federal courts, that have upset businesses and caused long lines at courthouses. He and the governor said the changes do not cut into the heart of the law.\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. Micky Hammon of Decatur said the bill he introduced in the House would make the law more workable for local governments, more enforceable for police, and less burdensome for law-abiding citizens and businesses.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Robert Bentley praised Hammon's work. "The essence of the bill will not change: Anyone living and working in Alabama must be here legally," he said.\par \par \uc2 The wide-ranging law requires police to determine citizenship status during traffic stops and requires government offices to verify legal residency for everyday transactions like obtaining a car license, enrolling a child in school, getting a job or renewing a business license\par \par \uc2 Bentley signed the law last June that both supporters and critics called the toughest in the nation. The U.S. Justice Department and 30 civil rights, religious and immigrant organizations challenged it in court. In the meantime, it caused both legal and illegal immigrants to leave the state for fear of arrest and caused farmers to complain about not having enough help to pick their crops.\par \par \uc2 Mary Bauer, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, called the bill "a half-hearted response to the economic and humanitarian crisis that is gripping our state."\par \par \uc2 Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, said, "No amount of revising or tinkering made to this anti-immigrant bill can fix it. Repealing it is the only option."\par \par \uc2 "Some activist groups don't have a problem with illegal immigration and will only be happy if the law is repealed. That's not going to happen," said Republican House Speaker Mike Hubbard of Auburn.\par \par \uc2 Hammon's bill removes two sections put on hold by federal courts. One prohibited illegal immigrants from attending college in Alabama and the other required Alabama's public schools to check the legal residency of new students.\par \par \uc2 It also revises a provision that allowed police to detain someone in a traffic stop if they had "reasonable suspicion" they were in the country illegally. In the future, that would only be done upon issuance of a traffic ticket or arrest.\par \par \uc2 It expands the types of identification that can be used to prove legal residency to include military IDs and Alabama driver's licenses that have been expired for less than six months.\par \par \uc2 Responding to complaints from businesses, it eliminated a provision that said renting to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is the same as harboring one. It also revised a provision to say a contractor will not be liable for a subcontractor hiring illegal immigrants unless the contractor had actual knowledge of those actions.\par \par \uc2 It also provides that showing proof of legal residency will only be required the first time that business licenses, driver's license and license plates are issued after the enactment of the law. Proof won't be necessary for renewals. Checking residency had caused long lines at some courthouses.\par \par \uc2 The law currently voids contracts with illegal immigrants, which raised concerns from businesses about loans and items purchased to pay for over time. Hammon's bill clarifies that it only applies to contracts entered into after the enactment of the law.\par \par \uc2 William Canary, president of the Business Council of Alabama, said his group supports Hammon's bill.\par \par \uc2 "These changes, while not perfect, are a much-needed step in the right direction and will allow businesses to clearly comply with both federal and state immigration law," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120406e8460000x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - Changes could be coming to Alabama's tough immigration law that has been challenged by the courts, churches and businesses.\par \par \uc2 Its author, Republican Rep. Micky Hammon, on Thursday offered revisions that he said would make the law more workable for local governments, more enforceable for police, and less burdensome for law-abiding citizens and businesses. It also addresses sections that courts have put on hold.\par \par \uc2 The wide-ranging law requires police to determine citizenship status during traffic stops and requires government offices to verify legal residency for everyday transactions like obtaining a car license, enrolling a child in school, getting a job or renewing a business license.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Robert Bentley praised Hammon's work and said, "The essence of the bill will not change: Anyone living and working in Alabama must be here legally." It would have to be approved by the legislature.\par \par \uc2 Bentley signed the law last June. Since then, the U.S. Justice Department and 30 civil rights, religious and immigrant organizations challenged it in court. In the meantime, it caused both legal and illegal immigrants to leave the state for fear of arrest and caused farmers to complain about not having enough help to pick their crops.\par \par \uc2 Mary Bauer, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, called Hammon's bill "a half-hearted response to the economic and humanitarian crisis that is gripping our state."\par \par \uc2 Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, said, "No amount of revising or tinkering made to this anti-immigrant bill can fix it.

That's not going to happen," said Republican House Speaker Mike Hubbard of Auburn.\par \par \uc2 Hammon's bill removes two sections put on hold by federal courts. One prohibited illegal immigrants from attending college in Alabama and another required public schools to check the legal residency of new students.\par \par \uc2 It revises a provision that allowed police to detain someone in a traffic stop if they had "reasonable suspicion" they were in the country illegal. In the future, that would only be done upon issuance of a traffic ticket or arrest.\par \par \uc2 It expands the types of identification that can be used to prove legal residency to include military IDs and Alabama driver's licenses that have been expired for less than six months.\par \par \uc2 Responding to complaints from businesses, it eliminated a provision that said renting to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is the same as harboring one.\par \par \uc2 The law currently voids contracts with illegal immigrants, which raised concerns from businesses about loans and items purchased and to be paid for over time.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - A Mississippi House chairman on Thursday abandoned his effort to revive tougher immigration enforcement provisions that included requiring local police to report suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 The issue now appears to be dead this legislative session, but it won't disappear from political discussion.\par \par \uc2 "I intend to hold hearings on this in the summer," House Judiciary B Committee Chairman Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week, an immigration enforcement measure, House Bill 488, was killed by a Senate committee chairman. Gipson said he had hoped to keep the issue alive by putting enforcement provisions into a Senate Bill 2549, which deals with the sale of counterfeit goods.\par \par \uc2 However, Gipson told the House on Thursday that after consulting with legislative staff attorneys, he determined he might not be successful in putting the provisions into the counterfeit-goods measure.\par \par \uc2 The House has strict rules against adding subjects to unrelated bills in the midst of a session.\par \par \uc2 Gipson said supporters of Senate Bill 2549 had told him the sale of counterfeit brake pads, medicine and other items was a problem in immigrant communities, so he originally thought it might be relevant to put immigration enforcement into that bill.\par \par \uc2 He said staff attorneys told him the subjects were not closely related and his attempted amendment could have been challenged if he had brought the amended bill up for a vote in the full House. A challenge would've forced House Speaker Philip Gunn, R-Clinton, to determine whether the two subjects were closely enough related, and that could've put Gunn in a position of angering fellow conservatives who've been pushing for an Arizona-style immigration law.\par \par \uc2 The immigration enforcement bill, House Bill 488, passed the House 70-48 on March 14. It died this week when Senate Judiciary B Committee Chairman Hob Bryan, D-Amory, chose not to bring it up for a vote before a deadline. Tuesday was the final day for House and Senate committees to act on general bills that already had passed the opposite chamber. Bryan said the bill would've improperly micromanaged the way local law-enforcement officers do their jobs.\par \par \uc2 House Bill 488 would've required police or deputies to report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement every time they arrest someone they suspect of being in the country illegally. Law enforcement departments that don't comply could be fined up to $5,000 per day. The bill also would've prohibited any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from applying for a driver's license or business license.\par \par \uc2 The bill was opposed by several influential business and agriculture groups, including the \uc2 Mississippi Economic Council\uc2  and the \uc2 Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation\uc2 . Sheriffs, police chiefs, county supervisors and municipal officials also came out against it, saying they feared the state would put extra duties on local law-enforcement officers without providing enough money to cover the costs of keeping immigrants in local jails.\par \par \uc2 Immigration enforcement was among the priorities of first-term Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican who won tea party support by saying the state should check on immigrants' status because he believes the federal government has failed to do so.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120405e845001eu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman promised Wednesday to veto a bill that would restore taxpayer-funded prenatal care coverage for illegal immigrants and singled out a fellow Republican leader who backed the measure.\par \par \uc2 The governor told reporters he was "extraordinarily disappointed" in the Legislature's first-round vote to advance the measure in the waning days of this year's session.\par \par \uc2 Heineman aimed his criticism at Speaker of the Legislature Mike Flood, a Republican who supported the bill.\par \par \uc2 "Taxpayer funds should not be used for illegal individuals," Heineman said, reading from a letter his office hand-delivered to the speaker's office. "If this bill becomes law, Nebraska will become a magnet for illegal aliens. Nebraska will become the only state in the Midwest providing taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals. None of our neighboring states, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota, provide taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals."\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers advanced the bill through the second of three votes late Wednesday, 29-16. They need at least 30 votes to sustain Heineman's veto.\par \par \uc2 The bill by Lincoln Sen. Kathy Campbell would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to establish Children's Health Insurance Program coverage for unborn children of mothers who are ineligible for Medicaid. Coverage is allowed under the CHIP program because it can only be applied to children, who would become U.S. citizens if born in America.\par \par \uc2 Roughly 870 illegal immigrants and 750 legal residents lost coverage in 2010, when the federal government ordered the state to stop offering the benefits through Medicaid. The Nebraska bill would allow women to instead enroll in the federal Children's Health Insurance Program, which allows fetuses to qualify federal- and state-funded care.\par \par \uc2 The bill would extend coverage to an estimated 1,162 fetuses each year, at a cost of $650,000 in state money and $1.9 million in federal tax dollars.\par \par \uc2 Supporters argued that the measure was a moral imperative, while opponents said it would force taxpayers to cover \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  care.\par \par \uc2 Flood, who has sponsored legislation banning late-term abortions, said the immigration concern was important, but trumped by the health concerns for unborn children who lack access to prenatal vitamins, ultrasounds, doctors and nurses. He said medical data doesn't support the notion that pregnant illegal immigrants would move to a state for prenatal care.\par \par \uc2 Flood said his vote on the prenatal care bill reflects his consistent opposition to abortion. The Republican senator said he has supported efforts to restrict other benefits to illegal immigrants and opted to "err on the side of life" when he voted for the proposal.\par \par \uc2 "It's about the issue for me," he said. "I work in an environment every day where I agree and disagree with my colleagues. I try to keep an open mind and think about the arguments that are being made, and respond on behalf of those I represent."\par \par \uc2 Heineman also criticized Flood and lawmakers for their votes on a bill that would let cities increase their sales tax rates by as much as one-half of a cent, if voters approve. The current limit is 1.5 cents for each dollar spent. The measure has won support from numerous Nebraska cities.\par \par \uc2 The sales tax bill would require voter support and a supermajority of the local city council to pass. Flood said he supported letting voters decide in their communities.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120405e8450003c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - Felipe Santos, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, and Terrance Williams, a black man, had little in common until about eight years ago. That was when they disappeared three months apart in the Naples area, both of them right after crossing paths with sheriff's Deputy Steven Calkins.\par \par \uc2 Investigations by local, state and federal authorities went nowhere. Calkins, who is white, denied doing anything more than dropping off the young men at different convenience stores. He was never charged but was fired after he stopped cooperating with investigators. The men's families were left to wonder and grieve after public interest faded.\par \par \uc2 Now their disappearance is back in the spotlight, in part because Hollywood star Tyler Perry and civil rights activists are using the Trayvon Martin case to draw attention to what they see as a string of injustices and incomplete investigations involving minorities.\par \par \uc2 "They were never arrested, never brought to jail," Perry wrote Sunday on Tylerperry.com. "They were put into the back of Deputy Calkins' car and never heard from again. And to this day Deputy Steve Calkins is a free man. I guess it's time to march in Naples now."\par \par \uc2 Santos, who did farm work and construction, was 23 when he vanished in October 2003. He had been driving with his brothers to work when he got into a fender bender. He didn't have registration or insurance, and Calkins arrested him, put him in the back of his patrol car and drove away.\par \par \uc2 When his brothers went to the jail to bail him out, he wasn't there.\par \par \uc2 Later, Calkins told investigators that because Santos was so cooperative, he decided not to arrest him and instead dropped him off at a store.\par \par \uc2 Williams, was 27 and had moved to Naples from Chattanooga, Tenn., to be closer to his mother after trouble with the law. His white Cadillac broke down in January 2004. Calkins spotted it and called in to the Collier County Sheriff's Office to run the vehicle number and have the car towed. In the recorded conversation, Calkins and the dispatcher both talked in exaggerated black dialect.\par \par \uc2 Later, Calkins told investigators that Williams asked him for a ride to a store and he let him off there. Police reports said Williams was last spotted by witnesses near a cemetery.\par \par \uc2 Don Hunter, the Collier County sheriff at the time, said Calkins' patrol car was tested for blood and signs of a struggle, but nothing was found. A tracking device was put on Calkins' car in case he had dumped their bodies and went back to the scene, Hunter said, but again nothing turned up.\par \par \uc2 The former sheriff noted that both men would have had some reason to disappear -- Santos was in the country illegally, and Williams was due back in court in Tennessee, where he was facing jail time for failure to pay child support.\par \par \uc2 Hunter eventually fired Calkins, saying that the deputy became uncooperative and that one of the three polygraph tests he took indicated some deception.\par \par \uc2 A working phone number for Calkins couldn't be found. In a 2006 interview with the Naples Daily News, he called his involvement in the two cases "coincidence extreme," and he told other news organizations that he didn't know anything about the disappearances.\par \par \uc2 In a September 2004 letter to the sheriff, Calkins said that his use of black dialect was "not meant to be offensive," but he admitted it was "in poor taste." He also asked the agency to reconsider his firing, saying that he was on medication for stress, anxiety and depression, and that a psychologist said he was "burnt out, overwhelmed, under considerable stress at home and work."\par \par \uc2 The former sheriff said that before he retired in 2009, he tried to get the story into the news around the anniversary of the men's disappearance in the hope of generating new clues.\par \par \uc2 "We've done what we could with it," said Hunter, now police chief in Marco Island, near Naples. "What I think it's going to finally come down to is whoever had more recent contact (than Calkins) with Mr. Santos or Mr. Williams."\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Collier County Sheriff's spokeswoman Karie Partington said that the case is still "open and active" and that investigators are checking out a tip that came in after Hunter appeared on CNN earlier this week. She gave no details.\par \par \uc2 "We're pleased with the attention it's received recently," she said.\par \par \uc2 Santos' brother Salvador said: "It has made me feel very good to know of Mr. Perry's efforts to publicize the case, and that the case is getting new attention."\par \par \uc2 Williams' mother, Marcia Williams, said a march with Perry and the Rev. Al Sharpton is in the works.\par \par \uc2 "I want to know where my baby is. That's the biggest frustration I have," she said. "As far as the Collier County Sheriff's Office, I pray that they did their job, I pray that they left no stone unturned."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Mitch Stacy on Twitter at: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/mitchstacy"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/mitchstacy}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120404e844001ry\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate panel; issue might be revived\b0\par\par\uc2 By EMILY WAGSTER PETTUS   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 465 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 April 2012\par 10:51\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - A Mississippi Senate chairman killed an immigration-enforcement bill by choosing not to bring it up for a vote in his committee before a Tuesday deadline, effectively squelching debate on one of Republican Gov. Phil Bryant's top issues.\par \par \uc2 Some House members are trying to revive the enforcement provisions by putting them into a counterfeit-goods bill that's still alive. But that strategy could fail because of strict legislative rules about wedging issues into unrelated or barely related bills in the midst of a session.\par \par \uc2 Judiciary B Committee Chairman Hob Bryan, D-Amory, said the bill attempted to micromanage the way law enforcement officers do their jobs.\par \par \uc2 "We would be telling local policemen how they should behave when they arrest somebody. We would be telling sheriff's deputies what they should do when they arrest somebody," Bryan said. "And I just don't think that's a proper role for the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 The bill would've required police or deputies to report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement every time they arrest someone they suspect of being in the country illegally. Law enforcement departments that don't comply could be fined up to $5,000 per day. The bill also would've prohibited any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from applying for a driver's license or business license.\par \par \uc2 Bryant is in his first year as governor after four years as lieutenant governor. He has courted Tea Party members the past several years by pledging to crack down on people who are in the United States without proper documentation.\par \par \uc2 "I go back again to the rule of law," Bryant told The Associated Press on Tuesday after the bill died. "There's so much confusion going on with people. I just simply think that this is about America being a nation of laws and that people that are violating our borders and coming here, that law enforcement needs to have the responsibility of making sure, if they're among the general population, we identify them and upholding the law."\par \par \uc2 Tuesday was the final day for House and Senate committees to act on general bills that have already passed the opposite chamber.\par \par \uc2 Because the immigration-enforcement bill didn't receive a vote in Senate Judiciary B, it died under the deadline.\par \par \uc2 The bill has been supported by the Mississippi Tea Party and the Mississippi Federation for Immigration Reform and Enforcement. It's opposed by sheriffs, police chiefs, city and county elected officials and several agriculture and business groups, including the influential \uc2 Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "God bless you, Hob Bryan," Rims Barber, a Jackson human-rights activist, told the senator after the bill died.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120404e84400186\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano doesn't believe tough state immigration laws will prevent federal and state officials from gathering information they need to discover terrorism or other threats.\par \par \uc2 The former Arizona governor made the remarks at a Phoenix press briefing Wednesday after giving a speech to hundreds of law enforcement officials attending an intelligence training event.\par \par \uc2 Among the concerns raised by opponents of state enforcement laws like Arizona's SB1070 is that illegal immigrants will be afraid to contact law enforcement when they're victims of crimes or when they have information that police need to know.\par \par \uc2 Major parts of Arizona's law were put on hold by a judge after the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit alleging those sections of the law were unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear Arizona's appeal of that injunction next month.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano said she believes outreach efforts by local officials and the availability of special federal visas for crime victims and witnesses will keep the information flowing.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - A bill that would restore prenatal care coverage to illegal immigrants in Nebraska cleared a first-round vote Tuesday in the Legislature, despite objections from Gov. Dave Heineman.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers advanced the measure through the first of three votes late Tuesday, 30-16. Lawmakers will need 30 "yes" votes to override Heineman's likely veto.\par \par \uc2 Supporters argued that the measure was a moral imperative, while opponents said it would force taxpayers to cover \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  care. The bill has divided a Legislature that overwhelmingly opposes abortion.\par \par \uc2 "The unborn child should not be penalized for the actions of his or her parents," said Speaker of the Legislature Mike Flood, who supported the bill. "This is a human life."\par \par \uc2 Ogallala Sen. Ken Schilz said the measure the bill represented "a crack in the armor of the laws we have in place" to discourage illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "I stand here tonight for those who believe that their tax dollars should not be used for those who want a better life for their offspring at the expense of Nebraska taxpayers," he said.\par \par \uc2 The bill by Lincoln Sen. Kathy Campbell would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to establish Children's Health Insurance Program coverage for unborn children of mothers who are ineligible for Medicaid.\par \par \uc2 The mothers were disqualified in March 2010, after the federal government ordered the state to stop offering prenatal services to some of the children through Medicaid. About 1,600 Nebraska women lost their coverage, roughly half of whom were illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Debate on the vote began shortly after Heineman and the state Republican Party released statements urging lawmakers to kill the proposal. The Nebraska Republican Party sent an email to supporters Tuesday evening, urging residents to contact their state senator to vote against "taxpayer-funded health benefits to illegal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 In prepared remarks, Heineman said he strongly opposed the bill and vowed to fight it.\par \par \uc2 "We should only be using taxpayer funds for legal Nebraska citizens, not for illegal aliens," Heineman said. "I am going to fight against LB 599 because it's not right that government should force legal citizens to pay for benefits for illegal aliens."\par \par \uc2 The bill would extend coverage to an estimated 1,200 unborn children per year. It would cost roughly $650,000 per year in state money and $2.6 million in federal dollars.\par \par \uc2 Omaha Sen. Jeremy Nordquist called the measure "an absolute moral and long-term fiscal imperative."\par \par \uc2 "When prenatal care is denied, as a result of inaction by this Legislature, it is the unborn baby who bears the full cost of this tragic decision," Nordquist said. "It is a moral imperative to give every Nebraska baby a chance to be born healthy."\par \par \uc2 Support for the bill has united religious, health care and social welfare advocates, who say a child's life outweighs the dispute over immigration. Health care providers say low-income women in Nebraska are waiting longer for prenatal care since they lost coverage and are more often facing complications at birth.\par \par \uc2 Prenatal care providers throughout Nebraska said the increase stems from a 2009 federal order that has forced women to travel farther for check-ups, which in turn has prompted some to wait until late in their final trimester. The safety-net providers say the decision also has increased the number of women they see each year, straining their budgets and sometimes leading to high staff turnover.\par \par \uc2 The number of pregnant women visiting the East Central District Health Department in Columbus increased from an average patient load of 139 pregnant women in March 2010, to 349 women last year.\par \par \uc2 The department's director, Rebecca Raymond, has said the clinic's federal recognition prevents it from denying service based on an ability to pay. She said the cuts have also meant longer drives for women -- 150 miles, in some cases -- who often lack reliable transportation.\par \par \uc2 The amount the clinic received in Medicaid reimbursement fell to $333,000 last year, compared with nearly $524,000 in 2009. When the cuts came, the clinic started receiving 100-200 calls per week.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120404e8440001p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Here's a glance at the status of selected bills in the Mississippi Legislature. Tuesday was the deadline for House and Senate committees to act on general bills that had already passed the opposite chamber. There are separate deadlines for budget and revenue bills.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 ALIVE\par \par \uc2 ABORTION -- House Bill 1390 would require physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and be board-certified in obstetrics and gynecology.\par \par \uc2 ATTORNEY GENERAL -- House Bill 211 would limit the powers of the attorney general. It would allow state government agency heads to hire outside lawyers without the attorney general's approval when they have conflicts with the attorney general. The bill would also require all outside legal contracts be filed with a state board.\par \par \uc2 SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION -- Senate Bill 2330 would consolidate Sunflower County's three school districts into one. The districts -- Sunflower County, Indianola and Drew -- are all under state conservatorship for a variety of reasons, including low academic performance. Senate Bill 2760 deals with consolidation of some of Bolivar County's six school districts. Senate Bill 2737 would allow the State Board of Education to consolidate failing districts that the state takes over for a second time.\par \par \uc2 SCHOOL START DATES -- House Bill 707 would require that schools start no earlier than the third Monday in August, which would be anywhere from Aug. 15 to Aug. 21.\par \par \uc2 UNDERAGE PREGNANCY -- House Bill 16 would require health care workers, clergy members, educators, child care workers, law enforcement officers and commercial film developers to report to investigators any alleged or suspected instance of sexual abuse of a child. Critics say its provisions are weaker than existing state law.\par \par \uc2 BREWERY SAMPLES -- House Bill 1019 would allow beer breweries to provide small samples for tasting during brewery tours.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 DEAD\par \par \uc2 CHARTER SCHOOLS -- Senate Bill 2401 would've allowed the creation of charter schools, which are public schools free from traditional rules.\par \par \uc2 IMMIGRATION -- House Bill 488 would've required police or deputies to report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement every time they arrest someone they suspect of being in the country illegally. Law enforcement departments that don't comply could be fined up to $5,000 per day. The bill also would've prohibited any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from applying for a driver's license or business license.\par \par \uc2 FETAL HEARTBEAT -- House Bill 1196 would've prohibited abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detectable, unless the woman's health is at risk.\par \par \uc2 RU-486 -- House Bill 790 would've regulated the use of the abortion-inducing drug RU-486 by requiring the prescribing physician to be in the room when the woman takes it.\par \par \uc2 CONSUMER LOANS -- House Bill 1396 would've allowed loan companies to charge 99 percent interest for loans up to $1,500. The current cap is 36 percent. It also would've changed amounts that could be charged for loans up to $4,000. For example, the new cap would be set at 74.83 percent interest for loans of $1,600 and 56.73 percent interest for loans of $4,000.\par \par \uc2 SCHOOL PRAYER -- House Bill 638 would've created a "limited public forum" to give public school students a chance to speak every school day and before every athletic competition, graduation or school event. Sponsors hoped this would make it legally acceptable for prayer before fellow students and other audiences.\par \par \uc2 SCRAP CARS -- Senate Bill 2667 aimed to penalize those who steal old cars and sell them for scrap. The original version of the bill would've made it a felony to knowingly falsify an affidavit claiming ownership of a vehicle without a title.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120404e84300002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - Students in the United States illegally would not qualify for in-state tuition at New Hampshire's public colleges under legislation headed to a vote in the state Senate.\par \par \uc2 Ronald Rodgers, general counsel for the University System of New Hampshire, told the Senate Education Committee on Tuesday the House-passed bill would require the system to verify that all 20,000 in-state students have the correct documents to qualify for the lower tuition. He said that would be a burden to the system and their families when no one has given examples of abuse.\par \par \uc2 But Rep. Joe Duarte, the bill's prime sponsor, said a 1996 federal immigration law prohibits states from giving students who are illegal immigrants in-state tuition unless they charge everyone that rate. He said students not lawfully in the country should pay the higher, non-resident rate.\par \par \uc2 "If you're not lawfully here, you should pay the full rate. We're not making statements that you can't go," he said.\par \par \uc2 Duarte, R-Candia, and Rep. Norman Tregenza, a co-sponsor, argued the lower, taxpayer subsidized tuition rates should be reserved for New Hampshire residents who also are legal residents of the United States.\par \par \uc2 "We are out of step with national law," said Tregenza, R-Madison.\par \par \uc2 About a dozen states allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who have lived in the U.S. for several years to become eligible for in-state tuition if they met certain criteria, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\par \par \uc2 Arizona, Colorado, Georgia and Indiana bar illegal immigrants from receiving in-state tuition, according to NCSL. South Carolina and Alabama prohibit them from enrolling in state colleges or universities, according to NCSL.\par \par \uc2 The New Hampshire bill would require the university system to establish a procedure that ensures students are in the country legally. The university system says that would mean examining birth certificates and other documents of 20,000 students receiving the lower tuition to determine which ones don't qualify. Annual non-resident tuition at the University of New Hampshire is about $13,000 higher than the in-state rate this year.\par \par \uc2 Opponents argue some students brought into the country as children would be penalized unfairly.\par \par \uc2 Eva Castillo-Turgeon, a New Hampshire-based advocate with the Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy Center, said children are brought into the country when they are young, raised as Americans and often don't realize they can't leave the country or qualify for other privileges until they are teenagers.\par \par \uc2 "They are brought up as an American but they don't have a stupid piece of paper," she said.\par \par \uc2 She said New Hampshire should be encouraging them to further their education and contribute to society, not place a high financial burden in their path.\par \par \uc2 The committee postponed voting on a recommendation to the full Senate, but members indicated the bill passed by the House was not acceptable.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - A Mississippi Senate chairman killed an immigration-enforcement bill by choosing not to bring it up for a vote in his committee before a Tuesday deadline, effectively squelching debate on one of Republican Gov. Phil Bryant's top issues.\par \par \uc2 Some House members are trying to revive the enforcement provisions by putting them into a counterfeit-goods bill that's still alive. But that strategy could fail because of strict legislative rules about wedging issues into unrelated or barely related bills in the midst of a session.\par \par \uc2 Judiciary B Committee Chairman Hob Bryan, D-Amory, said the bill attempted to micromanage the way law enforcement officers do their jobs.\par \par \uc2 "We would be telling local policemen how they should behave when they arrest somebody. We would be telling sheriff's deputies what they should do when they arrest somebody," Bryan said. "And I just don't think that's a proper role for the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 The bill would've required police or deputies to report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement every time they arrest someone they suspect of being in the country illegally. Law enforcement departments that don't comply could be fined up to $5,000 per day. The bill also would've prohibited any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from applying for a driver's license or business license.\par \par \uc2 Bryant is in his first year as governor after four years as lieutenant governor. He has courted Tea Party members the past several years by pledging to crack down on people who are in the United States without proper documentation.\par \par \uc2 "I go back again to the rule of law," Bryant told The Associated Press on Tuesday after the bill died. "There's so much confusion going on with people. I just simply think that this is about America being a nation of laws and that people that are violating our borders and coming here, that law enforcement needs to have the responsibility of making sure, if they're among the general population, we identify them and upholding the law."\par \par \uc2 Tuesday was the final day for House and Senate committees to act on general bills that have already passed the opposite chamber.\par \par \uc2 Because the immigration-enforcement bill didn't receive a vote in Senate Judiciary B, it died under the deadline.\par \par \uc2 The bill has been supported by the Mississippi Tea Party and the Mississippi Federation for Immigration Reform and Enforcement. It's opposed by sheriffs, police chiefs, city and county elected officials and several agriculture and business groups, including the influential \uc2 Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "God bless you, Hob Bryan," Rims Barber, a Jackson human-rights activist, told the senator after the bill died.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 The bill is House Bill 488.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120403e843001t7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Bar\b0\par\par\uc2 By BILL KACZOR   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 508 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 April 2012\par 18:19\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Eight members of Congress on Monday joined four former American Bar Association presidents in urging the state Supreme Court to grant a law license to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  whose parents brought him to the United States from Mexico on a visitor's visa when he was 9 years old.\par \par \uc2 Seven U.S. representatives and Puerto Rico's nonvoting resident commissioner sent a letter to the justices supporting Jose Godinez-Samperio's admission to the Florida Bar.\par \par \uc2 They also expressed support for a "friend of the court" brief being submitted by three ex-ABA presidents. The fourth, former Florida State University President Talbot "Sandy" D'Alemberte, is representing Godinez-Samperio. D'Alemberte, now a professor, was one of his teachers at Florida State's law school.\par \par \uc2 "Here's a kid who came over not speaking any English, learned to speak English, went to school, became an Eagle Scout, continued helping as an assistant scoutmaster, graduated valedictorian from his high school class," D'Alemberte said.\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio, 25, graduated from Florida's New College, earned a law degree at Florida State and passed the bar exam.\par \par \uc2 The Florida Board of Bar Examiners, though, declined to admit him, instead asking the justices for an advisory opinion on whether illegal immigrants can be licensed as lawyers.\par \par \uc2 D'Alemberte's argument is that requiring proof of immigration is an invalid policy because the board never obtained the Supreme Court's permission to adopt it as a formal rule. Therefore, Godinez-Samperio has complied with all valid requirements and should be admitted to the Florida Bar, he said.\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio's parents overstayed their visas and never returned to Mexico. He grew up in rural Hillsborough County. His father, a veterinarian in Mexico, milked cows on a dairy farm. His mother, a dentist, worked at a factory that made sliding glass doors.\par \par \uc2 The congressional representatives, all Democrats, noted the U.S. Supreme Court has found the Constitution requires all states to educate illegal immigrants through the 12th grade so Florida already has made a heavy investment in them.\par \par \uc2 "To deny these students an opportunity to become doctors or lawyers or practice another profession is to deny the state of Florida and all of our neighbors an educated and talented workforce," they wrote.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Kathy Castor of Tampa was the only Florida House member who signed. The others are Reps. Charles Gonzalez and Ruben Hinojosa of Texas, Xavier Becerra and Grace Napolitano of California, Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and Raul Grijalva of Arizona as well as Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi of Puerto Rico.\par \par \uc2 All of the former ABA presidents submitted the friend of the court brief are from Florida: Martha Barnett, Stephen Zack and William Reece Smith Jr.\par \par \uc2 A call to the Board of Bar Examiners placed shortly after 4 p.m. was answered with a recording saying the switchboard was closed for the day and that no messages could be accepted.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120402e8420024b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

House; speaker doesn't plan debate on immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN HANNA   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 698 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 March 2012\par 16:35\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - House Republicans who want to avoid a political dispute over cracking down on illegal immigration succeeded Friday in blocking a debate, and the chamber's leader said he doesn't plan to bring the issue up again this year.\par \par \uc2 Yet it wasn't clear that Speaker Mike O'Neal, of Hutchinson, can prevent the Kansas House from discussing immigration, an issue that divides fellow Republicans. The member who pushed for debate Friday said she expects legislators to have another chance -- and for pressure to build on GOP lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 The House sided with O'Neal and voted 91-31 against a request from Rep. Charlotte O'Hara, an Overland Park Republican, to dislodge an immigration bill from committee. The measure would require state and local government agencies and businesses holding contracts with those agencies worth more than $5,000 to use the federal E-Verify database to check whether new employees are in the U.S. legally.\par \par \uc2 A narrower bill, requiring state agencies to use E-Verify starting in 2013, cleared committee Thursday. But O'Neal said he won't schedule a debate on it because he's sure House members will insist on debating other, broader proposals to crack down on illegal immigration, as well as a plan backed by business groups to place some illegal immigrants in hard-to-fill jobs, particularly in agriculture.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think we need to debate immigration this year, but if we do, it's got to be something that people can agree on," O'Neal told The Associated Press. "That consensus has not been reached, and so I have no intention of debating it if I can help it."\par \par \uc2 Friday was the last day in session for lawmakers before their annual spring break. They plan to reconvene April 25 to wrap up the year's business, and O'Hara said the public will have a chance to influence legislators while they are away from the Statehouse.\par \par \uc2 O'Hara said the House's rejection of her request wasn't disappointing because it was difficult for GOP members to vote against their leaders.\par \par \uc2 "It's sown some seeds. We'll see what the grassroots do with it," she said. "I'm sure we'll have another opportunity."\par \par \uc2 A fellow GOP conservative, Secretary of State Kris Kobach, also is pushing for immigration legislation. Kobach is a former law professor who helped write tough immigration laws in Alabama and Arizona, and he's been visible nationally.\par \par \uc2 Kobach said if the House doesn't debate immigration, members running for re-election this year will have a hard time explaining their lack of action as they campaign because Kansans want lawmakers to tackle the issue.\par \par \uc2 "I fail to understand why a divisive debate over abortion or education is acceptable and a divisive debate over immigration is not acceptable," Kobach said. "It's a strange position to take."\par \par \uc2 Other immigration proposals would make it a crime to knowingly harbor an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and would direct law enforcement officers to check the status of some people they stop. Meanwhile, agriculture groups and the powerful Kansas Chamber of Commerce are backing the jobs-for-immigrants plan.\par \par \uc2 "It's a very difficult issue for the Republican Party in particular because it pits their tea party constituency against the business community constituency," said House Minority Leader Paul Davis, a Lawrence Democrat.\par \par \uc2 Allie Devine, a Topeka attorney and former state agriculture secretary who lobbies for business owners on immigration policy, said the bill O'Hara favored drew opposition because it would have applied to most government contractors. Also, an out-of-compliance company could be forced to pay damages equal to 25 percent of their contract payments.\par \par \uc2 She and O'Neal see little opposition to the E-Verify bill applying only to state agencies.\par \par \uc2 "It's the one piece that everybody can agree on, but no one will agree just to accept that piece," O'Neal said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Narrow E-Verify bill is HB 2575. Broader measure is HB 2577.\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Kansas Legislature: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kslegislature.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kslegislature.org}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120330e83u00055\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Several religious leaders united Thursday in declaring their opposition to an immigration enforcement bill under consideration by the Mississippi Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Representatives from Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist groups appeared Thursday at the state Capitol to reiterate their concerns about House Bill 488.\par \par \uc2 Bishop Ronnie Crudup of New Horizon Church in Jackson said the bill would lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 "This is not the spirit, nor the tone of the type of legislation we need for this state," Crudup said. "It will certainly cause racial profiling to go up for not only people of Hispanic descent, I would daresay also for people of color in general."\par \par \uc2 House Bill 488 passed the House on March 14 and awaits consideration in a Senate committee. It has faced opposition since it was introduced.\par \par \uc2 The measure would require police to report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement every time they arrest someone they suspect may be in the country illegally. Law enforcement departments that don't comply could be fined up to $5,000 per day. The bill would also prohibit any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from applying for a driver's license or business license.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Phil Bryant and other supporters of the bill say they're not against immigrants, but think people should be in the U.S. legally.\par \par \uc2 Imam Ali Siddiqui, a California peace and labor activist visiting Mississippi, said state immigration laws have had a negative impact on Muslims in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 "There is discrimination for jobs, women who wear hijab are discriminated against and spit on," Siddiqui said. "Every time we see laws that are passed like the one in Arizona, it has also impacted Muslims."\par \par \uc2 Hope Morgan Ward, the United Methodist bishop for Mississippi, told a small crowd gathered in the Capitol rotunda that the immigration bill does not follow Christian principals.\par \par \uc2 "Do no harm," Ward said. "House Bill 488, we believe, will do harm. It will create a greater climate of hostility and suspicion and fear."\par \par \uc2 Next Tuesday is the deadline for Senate committees to consider bills that have already passed the House, and for House committees to act on bills that have already passed the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, whose Judiciary B Committee is considering the bill, said he will treat the immigration-enforcement bill as he would any other that is assigned to his committee.\par \par \uc2 The Mississippi Tea Party, which supports the bill, issued a statement Thursday criticizing Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves for sending the bill to Bryan.\par \par \uc2 "In the past, Sen. Bryan has not been a friend of enforcement," the tea party said, citing his vote against a similar bill in 2011.\par \par \uc2 "Tate Reeves' referral of the bill to Sen. Bryan could very well result in its failure based on his prior vote," the group said. "Bryan has the power to kill the bill by not bringing it up for discussion or a vote at the committee level."\par \par \uc2 Some House members also fear the bill will die in the Senate committee, and they're trying to find other ways to keep the issue alive.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, House Judiciary B Committee Chairman Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, inserted the immigration-enforcement provisions into a Senate bill that attempts to further regulate the sale of counterfeit goods. It's unclear, though, whether the House rules allow the insertion of the immigration language into the seemingly unrelated counterfeit-goods bill, Senate Bill 2549, which involves different portions of state law. House rules prohibit adding new state code sections to bills in the midst of a legislative session. Gipson said he's checking with the House legal staff.\par \par \uc2 Gipson said some people pushing the counterfeit-goods bill say sale of the items affects immigrants, so adding the immigration-enforcement bill, "made sense to me."\par \par \uc2 Opposition to the immigration-enforcement bill has also come this week from sheriffs, police chiefs, county supervisors and municipal leaders, who say they worry about increased jail expenses with little or no state money to cover costs. Building contractors, several agriculture groups and the \uc2 Mississippi Economic Council\uc2  also oppose the bill.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120329e83t0020s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - Proposals for cracking down on illegal immigration in Kansas are foundering because of a split among majority Republicans in the state House, but GOP leaders faced pressure from some conservatives Wednesday to get legislation moving.\par \par \uc2 House Speaker Mike O'Neal, of Hutchinson, told fellow Republicans in a caucus meeting that he'd prefer to avoid a debate on immigration, suggesting it would be "bloody" and chiding some of them for pushing an issue that is "all about politics." He said if the House can't avoid a debate, he wants it to consider only a limited bill with widespread GOP support.\par \par \uc2 But agreement among Republicans appears to be elusive. Some conservatives want the House to debate proposals favored by Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a former law professor who helped draft tough immigration laws in Alabama and Arizona. Some rural Republicans back a proposal from influential business groups to create a program to place some illegal immigrants in hard-to-fill jobs in agriculture and other industries.\par \par \uc2 The House GOP's caucus came the day after the House Federal and State Affairs Committee tabled immigration legislation indefinitely. Chairman Steve Brunk, a Bel Aire Republican, wanted to vote on a measure requiring state agencies to use the federal E-Verify database to check employees' legal status, but members pushed both a broader E-Verify proposal and the business groups' idea, without settling on either.\par \par \uc2 "The issue isn't nearly as easy as what you are planning to put on your postcards," O'Neal told the GOP caucus, referring to election campaigns this year. "I've never promised a debate."\par \par \uc2 The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that Kansas has about 45,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers, making up about 3 percent of its total workforce. Some Republicans said illegal immigration was a big issue in their campaigns in 2010 and that voters expect action.\par \par \uc2 "How do I respond to these people who are hammering me in my district?" said Rep. Leslie Osterman, a freshman Wichita Republican.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Anthony Brown, a Eudora Republican, told fellow Republicans that the House can't avoid discussing at least an E-Verify proposal with interest in immigration issues running so high.\par \par \uc2 And Rep. Owen Donohoe, a Shawnee Republican, another backer of tough immigration proposals, said: "I didn't run to come here to do the easy thing. I came here to do what's right."\par \par \uc2 Brunk's committee has before it proposals to require government contractors to use E-Verify to check employees' legal status and to make it a crime to knowingly harbor an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Another measure would direct law enforcement officers to check the status of some people they stop.\par \par \uc2 Brunk pushed a proposal to impose the E-Verify requirement only for state agencies, and only for a year, so the state could test the effectiveness of the requirement. He said he hasn't given up on getting a modest E-Verify bill out of committee.\par \par \uc2 But House Majority Leader Arlen Siegfreid, an Olathe Republican, said he wants to avoid "a food fight" among Republicans. Some Republicans believe any debate would inevitably move to broader proposals.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to look bad, and who's going to win?" said Dan Kerschen, of Belle Plaine. "The Democrats are going to sit over there and say, `Look at them, they're imploding.'"\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Kansas Legislature\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kslegislature.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kslegislature.org}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120328e83s001bq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - The leaders of a special legislative committee set up to examine what North Carolina can do to crack down on illegal immigration say they do not plan to recommend any new legislation this year.\par \par \uc2 Committee co-chairman Rep. Harry Warren of Rowan County said Wednesday he and other Republican leaders have decided to wait for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on Arizona's anti-illegal immigration laws, which have been challenged by the U.S. Justice Department. The court is expected to hear arguments in the case this summer.\par \par \uc2 Warren said this year's planned short session is not the time to take up complicated legislation that could face a similar legal challenge without waiting for the high court to rule.\par \par \uc2 "Our goal is to address the problem of illegal immigration," Warren said. "This is going to be a short, short session. I wouldn't expect us to get knee deep into anything."\par \par \uc2 North Carolina's legislature works on a two-year cycle, with lawmakers typically avoiding controversial issues in the abbreviated legislative session that comes during an election year.\par \par \uc2 Still, there has been mounting pressure on the Republican majority swept into power in 2010 to follow the lead of other GOP-controlled legislatures in Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and other states that have enacted tough new laws barring illegal immigrants from accessing public services and empowering local law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of people they suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 North Carolina may be the first state where lawmakers have cited the pending Supreme Court case as a reason to hold off on new immigration legislation, said Karen Tumlin, managing attorney for the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group that has joined lawsuits seeking to overturn Alabama's law and other measures.\par \par \uc2 While the Supreme Court has been cited by individual lawmakers in other states as a reason for caution, Tumlin said she isn't aware of a legislative leadership adopting a wait-and-see approach as in North Carolina.\par \par \uc2 "It makes sense," she said. "There has been a very strong sign to statehouses that passing legislation like this will likely involve them in costly litigation."\par \par \uc2 The decision came as something of a surprise to both sides in the debate over how to address undocumented workers living in the state. Warren made the announcement at the end of a two-hour-long public hearing over potential immigration legislation. The meeting room was packed, split nearly evenly between those for and against new laws.\par \par \uc2 William Gheen, president of Americans for Legal Immigration, suggested that the Republican leaders would be "cowardly" not to pursue anti-illegal immigration legislation this year. He said House Speaker Thom Tillis and Senate leader Phil Berger, both Republicans, should "get on board with the brave heroes" in states that have enacted new laws. If they don't, Gheen said, he and other activists will work to throw them out of office.\par \par \uc2 Many opponents of new legislation at the hearing wore T-shirts that said "Do I Look Undocumented?" The phrase was intended to drive home that people, including law enforcement officers, can't tell who might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  by sight.\par \par \uc2 Among those who spoke to lawmakers were high school students and recent graduates brought to the United States illegally by their parents when they were children. Under state law, they cannot get driver's licenses and may not qualify for college programs.\par \par \uc2 Giovanna Hurtado, 22, came to North Carolina when she was 6 years old. The Yadkin County resident said she is undocumented and that her immigration status means she is under threat of being removed from the only home she knows.\par \par \uc2 She considers herself an American, whether or not she has the papers to prove it.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know what Mexico looks like, I don't have memories" Hurtado said, speaking without any trace of an accent that might betray her national origin. "This is my home."\par \par \uc2 --\par \par \uc2 Staff writer Tom Breen contributed.\par \par \uc2 --\par \par \uc2 Follow AP writer Michael Biesecker at twitter.com/mbieseck\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120328e83s000oe\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FARMERS BRANCH, Texas (AP) - A Dallas suburb has spent five years and nearly $5 million trying to ban illegal immigrants from renting apartments within city limits, but court challenges have kept the law from taking effect. Still, city officials say they're likely to press on.\par \par \uc2 The fight has pushed Farmers Branch, a quiet collection of bedroom communities and office parks, into the national debate about illegal immigration. Local Latinos say it also has made U.S. citizens and legal immigrants feel unwelcome in the city, where the Latino population has fallen in recent years.\par \par \uc2 City officials and law backers argue that illegal immigrants strain local schools and police resources. They also note that local voters supported an early version of the law five years ago by a 2-to-1 margin.\par \par \uc2 "We're trying to solve a problem that people perceive to have," Mayor Jack Glancy told The Associated Press. "If the (federal) government would do what it's supposed to do, we wouldn't be in the middle of this thing."\par \par \uc2 The city council must now decide whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court or push for a hearing before the full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel last week upheld a lower court's ruling blocking the law.\par \par \uc2 Farmers Branch's city council, which has never included a Latino, has in recent years declared English to be the city's official language and resisted efforts to shift voting from an at-large system, which Latinos complain dilutes their voice. The council first passed a renters' ban in 2006, but replaced it two years later on the advice of its attorneys.\par \par \uc2 The new law would require all renters to obtain a city license and the city's building inspector to check the status of any applicant who wasn't a U.S. citizen. Illegal immigrants would be denied a renters' permit, and landlords who knowingly allowed them to stay could have their renters' license barred.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge put that law on hold after landlords and renters sued the city, and courts have continued to block it -- most recently on Wednesday by the 5th Circuit.\par \par \uc2 Similar bans pushed in other cities, most notably Fremont, Neb., and Hazleton, Pa., are in the middle of similar court fights.\par \par \uc2 A judge recently allowed Fremont to require renters to obtain a permit but stopped the city from revoking the permits if renters were found to be illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Hazleton's law, which would sanction business owners for employing illegal immigrants and property owners for renting to them, also is on hold. But backers will get a new hearing because the Supreme Court last year, citing its decision in another case, vacated a federal appeals court's ruling against the law.\par \par \uc2 Kris Kobach, a national advocate for tougher immigration laws and Kansas' secretary of state, has represented Farmers Branch in court and said the city would have a good chance if it continues its case. He noted that much of the legal work has been done, so costs shouldn't grow much.\par \par \uc2 Latino civil rights group MALDEF, which is helping fight the Farmers Branch law, said backers of such laws should give up.\par \par \uc2 "The federal courts have made clear that cities cannot make their own immigration laws and target residents for expulsion simply because of their race or nationality," Nina Perales, MALDEF's vice president of litigation, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Despite rallies and heated protests at the time, Ben Robinson, a Farmers Branch councilman, points to the 2007 referendum that showed strong support for the law.\par \par \uc2 "As far as I know, they still feel that way," he said.\par \par \uc2 Glancy emphasized that the city is targeting illegal immigrants, not legal immigrants or U.S. citizens, noting that the city's library hosts English classes. Thursday's class drew 50 people from all over the world -- Cambodia, Germany and several Latin American countries -- who sounded out nouns and verbs with the help of local volunteers.\par \par \uc2 The mayor also said that since the law was first passed, the number of car accidents involving uninsured drivers has declined and fewer students have moved in and out of local schools.\par \par \uc2 Statistics from the Carrollton-Farmers Branch school district, which includes parts of Farmers Branch and surrounding cities, show the percentage of "mobile" students has fallen, though district spokeswoman Angela Shelley said the school does not keep track of students' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 A message seeking comment from local police about Glancy's uninsured drivers claim wasn't returned.\par \par \uc2 "Something needed to be done," Glancy said. "The federal government wasn't doing it. People were frustrated, and we're the ones closest to the people."\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Villafranca sees things differently. Villafranca owns a local Mexican restaurant and moved to Farmers Branch after the push to ban \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  residents began. She ran and lost for city council.\par \par \uc2 Villafranca said she and other U.S.-born Latinos, along with legal immigrants, are more often pulled over by police or threatened by other residents. Though the law never went into effect, Villafranca said, supporters "had the effect they wanted."\par \par \uc2 Longtime resident Jack Viveros, a financial planner, said friends and neighbors started asking questions about his background in recent years.\par \par \uc2 "It's still a dividing factor," Viveros said. "It has divided the city dramatically."\par \par \uc2 The city has an annual budget of $77 million and has to cut salaries and benefits in recent years, making the $4.5 million spent on immigration-related lawsuits stand out.\par \par \uc2 Robinson, the longtime councilman, called the legal fees "outrageous" but said he supported continuing the case.\par \par \uc2 "I think the only way that we're ever going to have a proper handle on, and control over, illegal immigration in this country is by the states and the cities having the types of laws ... necessary to control illegal immigration," he said.\par \par \uc2 Viveros said he wanted the case to end so the city could heal.\par \par \uc2 "When we drop this thing, when it's finally done and over with, it's like a relationship with a person," Viveros said. "When you first break up, you're hateful and angry and all that kind of stuff. After time, things just become acceptable and things go back to normal."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120324e83o002br\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A new report by the federal government estimates that the number of illegal immigrants living in Arizona has fallen by 200,000 since 2008.\par \par \uc2 Experts say the primary factor behind the exodus was a lack of jobs during the recession, but also noted that tighter border enforcement and tough immigration laws were contributing factors.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona Republic reports ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/GPVdbh"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/GPVdbh}}}\uc2 ) that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's report had estimated that there were 360,000 illegal immigrants in the state as of January 2011.\par \par \uc2 That's down 110,000 from a year earlier and down 200,000 from the peak in 2008.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, there were an estimated 560,000 illegal immigrants living in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The report suggests that the number of illegal immigrants in Arizona is at its lowest level since 2000, when an earlier DHS report estimated that there were 330,000 illegal immigrants in the state.\par \par \uc2 The latest report is based on 2010 census data, while the earlier figures came from 2000 census data.\par \par \uc2 A Homeland Security official cautioned against making direct comparisons between the estimates released Friday and earlier estimates by the agency because they are based on census data a decade apart.\par \par \uc2 Although there is no question Arizona's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population has decreased sharply, it's difficult to say by how much, said \uc2 Jeffrey Passel\uc2 , senior demographer at the \uc2 Pew Hispanic Center\uc2 , which studies the nation's immigrant population.\par \par \uc2 That is because the 2010 census counted fewer Latinos in Arizona than previously estimated. As a result, the number of illegal immigrants in the state may not have been as large as once thought, Passel said.\par \par \uc2 Lisa Magana, a political science professor and immigration expert at Arizona State University's School of Transborder Studies, said the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population in Arizona has decreased primarily because of the economy. Fewer jobs in construction and the tourism industry spurred many illegal immigrants to leave and fewer to arrive, she said.\par \par \uc2 Magana said tighter border security and a series of state immigration-enforcement laws, such as Arizona's 2010 immigration enforcement law, aimed at driving illegal immigrants out of Arizona also played a role.\par \par \uc2 Republican state Sen. Steve Smith from the community of Maricopa said illegal immigration remains a major problem in the state.\par \par \uc2 This year, he introduced two bills that would have required schools and hospitals in Arizona to keep track of illegal immigrants. Both bills died.\par \par \uc2 Smith said he has no plans to back off from sponsoring illegal-immigration-enforcement bills, despite the decrease in the state's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population. He said that as the economy rebounds so will illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "I will continue to introduce any legislation that will help us get a handle on this problem," he said.\par \par \uc2 Arizona now ranks ninth out of the 10 states with the largest number of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 California ranks first with the most illegal immigrants in a state, followed by Texas, Florida and Illinois.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Arizona Republic, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azcentral.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azcentral.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120324e83o0021p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - As Alabama lawmakers prepare to return for the second half of their 2012 session, a raft of contentious disagreements threatens to break up the harmony between Democrats and the Republican majority that prevailed earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 The first half of the session saw less bickering than in 2011, the first year the Republicans held sway in the House and Senate.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers enter the second half of the session on April 3 after taking a spring break, with much of their work yet to be done.\par \par \uc2 They have not officially started work on the budgets, expected to be a major challenge considering the state's financial problems. Gov. Robert Bentley has ordered more than 10 percent cuts in the General Fund budget for the remainder of the current fiscal year. The General Fund pays for most non-education state services like prisons, state troopers, Medicaid and public health.\par \par \uc2 Even steeper cuts are expected in the budgets for the 2012-2013 fiscal year, which begins in October.\par \par \uc2 House Speaker Mike Hubbard said he expects committees to start working on the budgets as soon as lawmakers return from spring week, He said they will try to deal with the budget problems through spending cuts and don't anticipate proposing any new taxes or gambling to raise money. He said there is not sentiment in the House for raising any taxes, even taxes on cigarettes.\par \par \uc2 "They don't want a cigarette tax," Hubbard said of House members.\par \par \uc2 House Minority Leader Democratic Rep. Craig Ford of Gadsden said he hopes the budget is not cut across the board, but that priority is given to social services and to areas where federal matching money is available. He said he hopes legislators look to change sentencing guidelines to help ease prison overcrowding and save money. A bill to overhaul sentencing guidelines has passed the Senate and is pending in the House.\par \par \uc2 "Sentencing guidelines have to be revisited," Ford said. "It's not right for people convicted of murder to get 20 years and someone get more than that for writing a bad check."\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers expect to devote time to revising the immigration bill which passed last year. They say it needs some changes such as revising a section that some say makes it illegal for a charity to provide an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a meal.\par \par \uc2 "We just hope to make the immigration bill better," said Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh. "We don't want to punish someone for working in a soup kitchen."\par \par \uc2 Hubbard predicted the new bill would be better than the original.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers also face the sometimes tricky task of redrawing their own districts. Hubbard and Marsh said they expect the governor to schedule a special session to handle redistricting. Marsh said he believed the districts could be redrawn without putting incumbent legislators in each other's districts.\par \par \uc2 Ford said he hopes Republican leaders are fair with Democrats in the redistricting process. He said Democrats are prepared to file a lawsuit if they feel the plan is not fair.\par \par \uc2 A bill introduced late in the first half of the session authorizing charter schools faces strong opposition from the state teacher's union and is expected to generate debate that may dominate the session's second half.\par \par \uc2 Ford said he expects Democrats to launch a strong challenge to the charter schools bill, claiming that it would take badly needed money away from regular public schools. Republicans hold wide enough majorities in the House and Senate that they can easily win most votes, but some GOP members have they would vote against the charter schools, which operate with public funding, but without all of the rules and regulations of public schools.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120324e83o0018j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc65}{\*\bkmkend toc65}\b \uc2 Bill would bar illegal immigrants from colleges\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATE BRUMBACK   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 742 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 March 2012\par 18:27\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A Georgia legislative committee on Monday voted to approve a bill that would bar illegal immigrants from state colleges, universities and technical schools.\par \par \uc2 The House Judiciary Non-Civil committee passed an amended version of the bill that passed the Senate chamber earlier this month. It now goes to the House Rules Committee, which will decide whether to bring it up for debate before the full House.\par \par \uc2 The bill's main sponsor, Sen. Barry Loudermilk, R-Cassville, said the bill is meant in part to clarify the intent of a 2006 law that he says should have been interpreted as prohibiting state colleges and universities from accepting illegal immigrants. It also makes some changes to identification requirements for applicants for public benefits laid out by a law enacted last year to crack down on illegal immigration in the state.\par \par \uc2 The committee heard from both supporters and opponents of the bill during nearly two hours of discussion. Almost all of the discussion centered on the education provisions of the proposal. Supporters of the bill say it's necessary to preserve state-funded education for citizens and legal residents. Opponents say the bill unfairly denies motivated \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students the opportunity to further their education.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants already are effectively barred from the most competitive state schools because of a Board of Regents policy created in 2010 that prohibits any institution that has rejected academically qualified applicants in the previous two years from accepting illegal immigrants. That includes the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Georgia Health Sciences University and Georgia College & State University. Illegal immigrants may still be admitted to any other state college or university but must pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 University system Chancellor Hank Huckaby told committee members he believes that policy is adequate and asked that it be allowed to work. He offered nearly identical testimony before a Senate committee last month and before another House committee that was considering a similar bill.\par \par \uc2 "We believe this policy assures undocumented students do not receive a public benefit since they must pay out of state tuition and that no undocumented student will be taking a seat in a class away from a Georgia student, since our selective institutions are not allowed to admit undocumented students," University system Chancellor Hank Huckaby said.\par \par \uc2 The university system has said it does not believe illegal immigrants receive a public benefit via postsecondary education because they must pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 Loudermilk said that even if illegal immigrants are covering the direct cost of their education by paying out-of-state tuition, they also benefit from the buildings, computer systems and other capital investments that are funded by tax dollars.\par \par \uc2 "Postsecondary education is a public benefit whether it is directly subsidized or not," he said.\par \par \uc2 Democratic lawmakers raised some concerns about the bill. House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, D-Atlanta, suggested it was possible that people who are in the country legally but don't have their paperwork because of bureaucratic problems might be excluded. And Rep. Roberta Abdul-Salaam, D-Riverdale, said she was concerned that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students might be discouraged from completing high school if they're not allowed to go to state colleges.\par \par \uc2 Only South Carolina currently prohibits state colleges and universities from admitting illegal immigrants. A section of Alabama's tough new law targeting illegal immigration that would have done the same has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.\par \par \uc2 The version of the bill that passed the full Senate earlier this month did not explicitly define postsecondary education as a public benefit, though the sponsors said that was implied through references to a section of federal law. But the House committee approved an amendment Monday that specifically adds postsecondary education to a list of public benefits that illegal immigrants are ineligble to receive.\par \par \uc2 The bill also includes some changes to the identification requirements from last year's law for applicants for public benefits, which include food stamps and professional licenses. Notably, it says applicants for public benefits can submit required paperwork up to nine months before the application deadline and that U.S. citizens don't have to resubmit "secure and verifiable" identification documents to renew a benefit with the same agency. It also excludes foreign passports from a list of acceptable identification documents unless valid federal immigration paperwork is also submitted.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120319e83j0023v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The Minuteman border-watch movement that exploded in southern Arizona in the last decade has virtually disappeared, according to a new report from an Alabama-based civil rights center that monitors hate groups.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star reports ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/zbVCVz"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/zbVCVz}}}\uc2 ) that an annual report by the \uc2 Southern Poverty Law Center\uc2  said the drop comes after members' concerns about illegal immigration have been adopted by other groups and state legislatures.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, the number of groups termed by the center as "nativist extremists" -- such as the Minuteman -- declined by 42 percent, the center's report said. But at the same time the center said the number of anti-government "Patriot" groups grew to record levels.\par \par \uc2 The center began tracking what it calls "nativist extremist" groups after the Minuteman movement exploded in the mid-2000s. These groups distinguish themselves from regular anti-illegal-immigration opinion by directly confronting suspected illegal immigrants at the border, at day-labor centers or elsewhere, said \uc2 Heidi Beirich\uc2 , director of the center's intelligence project.\par \par \uc2 The number of active groups in this category hit a peak of 319 in 2010 before declining to 184 last year, the center says.\par \par \uc2 Infighting, bad press and co-opting of the movement has driven its decline, Beirich said.\par \par \uc2 Groups such as the Arizona-based Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, once the best known of this category, splintered and dissolved. The arrest of one-time Minuteman Shawna Forde, for murdering an Arivaca man and his daughter in 2009, also drove people away.\par \par \uc2 Most important, Beirich said, anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  actions were taken up by state legislatures and absorbed as a major concern by groups such as the tea parties and the Republican Party. Many people who once concerned themselves with border-watch activities moved on to the broader concerns of the tea-party movement, she said.\par \par \uc2 Another concern was safety as Mexico's drug traffickers raised their level of violence, said Al Garza, a one-time leader of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps.\par \par \uc2 "For anyone on this side to make a stand against them would be foolish," he said.\par \par \uc2 But not everyone considers the Alabama-based law center, which began as a civil-rights group in 1971, a reliable source on extremism. Longtime Arizona Republic reporter Jerry Kammer, now a staffer at the Center for Immigration Studies in Virginia, has written several critiques of the center's work, especially on anti-illegal-immigration groups.\par \par \uc2 Kammer called it a "hysteria and hype machine that cons the well-intentioned but poorly informed."\par \par \uc2 "In its hysteria to sound the alarm about `record levels' of hate, the SPLC assembles phony and trivial statistics that distract attention from the truly dangerous groups," Kammer said via email.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Arizona Daily Star, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azstarnet.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azstarnet.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120318e83i001sa\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

House moves to combat illegal immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By JEFF AMY   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 779 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 March 2012\par 03:45\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Mississippi House members want to step up enforcement against illegal immigrants, voting 70-47 in favor just after midnight Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Leaders stripped more controversial provisions before the vote on House Bill 488. After initially failing, opponents of the bill were able on a second attempt to strip a provision requiring schools to count illegal immigrants, saying it would violate federal law.\par \par \uc2 House Judiciary B Committee Chairman Andy Gipson, a Braxton Republican, denied opponents' claims that the measure was racist or immoral, saying it was about enforcing the law. Gipson said he tried to craft a bill that would survive court challenges and allow charity toward migrants.\par \par \uc2 "It's about the rule of law," he told House members. "We want to say you're welcome here, we just want you to follow the proper procedures, the proper protocols."\par \par \uc2 Opponents warned families would be shattered by deportations and that the bill would reinforce outsiders' stereotypes of Mississippi.\par \par \uc2 "If we pass this bill, it will set Mississippi back 60 years," said Rep. Sonya Williams-Barnes, D-Gulfport. "Let us show America we are not the narrow-minded people they say we are."\par \par \uc2 No Republicans opposed the bill, while 10 mostly white and rural Democrats voted for it. They crossed party lines despite an appeal from House Agriculture Chairman Preston Sullivan, D-Okolona, a rural white Democrat who warned the bill would hurt farmers.\par \par \uc2 A provision that allowed law enforcement officers to ask about a person's immigration status in a traffic stop was removed. That means someone would have to be arrested for another offense before inquiries could be made.\par \par \uc2 "If they're stopped, that in itself will not trigger this bill," Gipson said. "It would require an arrest to be made. If they are found to be unlawful, then they would be deported."\par \par \uc2 Among earlier changes was the removal of a clause that said people could be arrested for not carrying identification, a clause that had led opponents to nickname the measure the "papers, please" bill. That portion, like several others removed in committee last month, have been blocked by courts in Arizona, Alabama and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 During the debate that ran from late Wednesday into Thursday, Gipson also removed a provision that could have allowed municipal utilities to refuse power, water, sewer and other services to illegal immigrants. Such a provision was also recently blocked by a federal court in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Gipson said he was balancing the need to write a law that will survive court scrutiny versus the desire to remove illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "I have tried to bring the best possible product to the body for a vote," he said.\par \par \uc2 The changes did little to mollify critics, who continued to question whether the bill was needed. Opponents emphasize that Mississippi doesn't need to summon any ghosts of its racist past.\par \par \uc2 Opponents in the House debate zeroed in on the possibility that parents could be arrested, leaving behind children who are U.S. citizens. Those who have fought the Alabama and Arizona measures have highlighted such problems.\par \par \uc2 "Your bill has nothing in it to show any kind of compassion or any kind of consideration for the children who are left behind," said Rep. Kelvin Buck, D-Holly Springs.\par \par \uc2 Gipson admitted that "some separations" were a possibility.\par \par \uc2 Mississippi has a relatively small \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population, although it appears to have grown in recent years. The Pew Hispanic Center estimated that in 2010, the state had about 45,000 illegal immigrants out of nearly 3 million total residents.\par \par \uc2 The bill is supported by Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican who has been campaigning against illegal immigration since his days as state auditor. Proponents say the state spends more money providing services to immigrants than it reaps in taxes, and claim that illegal immigrants, if they leave, will vacate jobs that unemployed citizens can take. They say the bill is about legal compliance and that they welcome legal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Gipson denied any racist intent, saying he had helped start a Hispanic ministry at a church nearly 20 years ago.\par \par \uc2 "I have been accused of being a racist," he said. "I reject that."\par \par \uc2 Gipson earlier added an amendment that allows any church or religious organization to minister to "immediate basic and human needs." He told a questioner Wednesday that a soup kitchen could feed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  every day and not run afoul of the proposed bill. But Gipson said that, "if the question is `Can they harbor these people?' the answer is `No.'"\par \par \uc2 The bill now goes to the Senate, which has not advanced its own immigration bill.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120315e83f000gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked two more sections of Alabama's tough new law targeting illegal immigration pending the outcome of lawsuits that seek to overturn the law entirely.\par \par \uc2 The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order temporarily halting a section that says courts can't enforce contracts involving illegal immigrants and another that makes it a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state.\par \par \uc2 The law adopted last year was challenged by both the federal government and a coalition of activist groups. A three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit heard arguments last week but said it won't rule on the overall case until the U.S. Supreme Court decides a federal challenge to a similar law in Arizona. The appeals court is also weighing Georgia's law.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers in the Alabama case had asked the court to at least temporarily stop the two sections and others, claiming they were causing harm to people in the state.\par \par \uc2 "We are very pleased that the Eleventh Circuit understood the harms these provisions were causing in Alabama, and saw fit to enjoin them," said the Southern Poverty Law Center's Sam Brooke, who argued before the panel last week. "This is a great day for the residents of our state."\par \par \uc2 Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said he strongly disagrees with the court's decision.\par \par \uc2 "I will continue to vigorously defend Alabama's immigration law in the courts," he said. "I am hopeful that the Supreme Court's coming decision in the Arizona case will make clear that our law is constitutional."\par \par \uc2 In October, the appeals court temporarily blocked other parts of the law, including a requirement for schools to check students' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Sections still in effect include one that requires a law enforcement officer to determine the citizenship and legal status of a person stopped or arrested if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" that he person is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers in the Georgia case did not ask for immediate action because the parts of that state's law that they believe are most harmful were blocked by a federal judge in June.\par \par \uc2 After Arizona adopted its tough law in 2010, five other states -- Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah -- adopted variations on it last year, with Alabama's widely considered the toughest in the nation. All five laws have been challenged by coalitions of civil rights and immigrant rights groups, and the federal government has sued to block those in Alabama, South Carolina and Utah.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the measures argue such laws lead to discrimination and racial profiling, and they say immigration is a federal issue that shouldn't be governed by a patchwork of state laws. Supporters say states have been forced to protect their resources because the federal government hasn't done enough to quell the influx of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Phillip Rawls in Montgomery, Ala., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120308e83800238\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A federal appeals court on Thursday temporarily blocked two sections of Alabama's tough new law targeting illegal immigration pending the outcome of legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order blocking a section that says courts can't enforce contracts involving illegal immigrants and another that makes it a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's law was challenged last year by both the federal government and a coalition of activist groups, and the cases have been appealed to the 11th Circuit. A three-judge panel in that court heard arguments in the case last week but said it won't rule on the challenges to Alabama's law and another in Georgia until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a federal challenge to a similar law in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "We are very pleased that the Eleventh Circuit understood the harms these provisions were causing in Alabama, and saw fit to enjoin them," said the Southern Poverty Law Center's Sam Brooke, who argued before the 11th Circuit last week. "This is a great day for the residents of our state."\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the measures argue such laws lead to discrimination and racial profiling and that immigration is a federal issue that shouldn't be governed by a patchwork of state laws. Supporters say states have been forced to act to protect their resources because the federal government hasn't done enough to quell the influx of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120308e8380022s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - A former case manager at a shelter for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children who were caught crossing the border alone sexually abused six teenagers while he was supervising calls they made to relatives in Central America, a prosecutor said on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Mark Birney, a deputy district attorney for Orange County, said in opening statements that Victor Salazar molested the boys inside his closed-door office at the Fullerton shelter multiple times between 2007 and 2008.\par \par \uc2 "They feared that if they said something, they wouldn't be believed. They'd be deported. They'd be ostracized for having another man touch them," Birney said. The teens didn't want to stir up any trouble at the center, which provided them with food, clothing, a stable environment and the chance to go to school, he said.\par \par \uc2 Salazar, 30, is on trial for the alleged abuse, which led the federally contracted shelter to install office doors with windows, enhance video surveillance and ban one-on-one transport of children by staff. If convicted of all the charges, he could face up to a decade in prison.\par \par \uc2 His attorney, Lisa Eyanson, told jurors that children often grew emotional during phone calls to family and any touching Salazar did was aimed only at comforting them. She also said the teen who initially reported the alleged touching had recently been disciplined by Salazar for throwing an object at a teacher.\par \par \uc2 "You'll find there was no sexual intent to any touching that was done," she said.\par \par \uc2 The case provides a window into a program overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services for children swept up by border agents. Many of the children leave their homes in Central America to reunite with family in the U.S., while others flee abuse or set off in search of jobs to support their relatives.\par \par \uc2 More than 6,000 children hailing largely from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras were taken into federal custody in the 2009 fiscal year. Most of them, like the alleged victims in the case against Salazar, were teenage boys, according to federal statistics.\par \par \uc2 The federal government contracts with shelters around the country, like the one in Fullerton, to house the children, while case managers try to determine whether they should be reunited with family here, placed in foster care or returned to their countries.\par \par \uc2 Salazar began working at the shelter for immigrant children when it opened in March 2006. He previously worked at another facility for teens where he had cleared background checks and got rave reviews from the children and his fellow staff members, Joyce Capelle, executive director for Florence Crittenton Services of Orange County, told the Associated Press by phone.\par \par \uc2 After a teenager at the center reported that he heard Salazar had inappropriately touched another child, Crittenton put Salazar on administrative leave and called police.\par \par \uc2 The investigation turned up a total of six children with similar complaints, including some who had been released to live with relatives in the United States, Capelle said.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say Salazar molested six boys between the ages of 15 and 16 between May 2007 and February 2008. He is charged with four felony counts of lewd acts on a child, three felony counts of oral copulation of a minor and seven misdemeanor counts of sexual battery.\par \par \uc2 During the trial in Superior Court in Santa Ana, prosecutors plan to call to the stand three of the alleged victims who were released from the shelter to live with family or foster parents and now have legal status in the United States. Two of the alleged victims were returned to Central America, Birney said.\par \par \uc2 Since Salazar's arrest, the center in Fullerton has trained staff on child abuse under a special program focused on refugee and immigrant children. Other government-contracted shelters had already started conducting the training in response to prior allegations of sexual abuse at a shelter in Texas, Capelle said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120307e837001v8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer blasted the federal government for failing to secure the U.S.-Mexico border while invoking the names of a slain rancher and Border Patrol agent on Tuesday at a major border-security expo being held in downtown Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to a room of law enforcement officers and those in the border technology industry, Brewer said the immigration issue isn't about hate or skin color, as her critics say -- it's about securing the border and keeping Americans safe.\par \par \uc2 "Of course, there are those in Washington who will tell you -- from 3,000 miles away, by the way -- that our border is more secure than ever," Brewer said. "No amount of distortion can hide the absolute truth. The federal government, Republicans and Democrats alike, have failed every single American, all of us."\par \par \uc2 She said Washington's "abdication of responsibility is the overarching outrage of American illegal immigration crisis."\par \par \uc2 "America's failure to understand this problem at a national level and to deal with it has haunted borders like mine for decades," she said.\par \par \uc2 Brewer pointed to the killings of rancher Rob Krentz and Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.\par \par \uc2 Authorities believe an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  killed Krentz while he was checking water lines on his property near the Arizona-Mexico border in March 2010.\par \par \uc2 Terry was killed in a shootout with border bandits in December 2010. A gun used in his shooting was connected to the botched federal operation known as Fast and Furious, in which agents lost track of nearly 1,400 of the more than 2,000 guns purchased by suspected straw buyers.\par \par \uc2 Later in the day, during a panel discussion by border sheriffs, Chief Deputy Sheriff Rodney Rothrock of southeastern Arizona's Cochise County again brought up Krentz, whose ranch falls under Rothrock's jurisdiction.\par \par \uc2 He said the killing was still being actively investigated and that it is ever-present in many people's minds in the county.\par \par \uc2 "We've got a lot of rural country, a lot of ranch families and farm families, and a lot of people are living in fear every day," Rothrock said. "They carry firearms everywhere they go because they simply don't know what they're going to encounter."\par \par \uc2 While Brewer was at the expo, she visited a number of booths where border-security companies displayed their wares in hopes that federal agents would like what they saw and help them win lucrative contracts.\par \par \uc2 On display were giant trucks equipped for border surveillance that are painted with eagles, all-terrain vehicles with spotlights, unmanned aerial drones, night-vision goggles and giant outdoor camouflaged monitoring centers.\par \par \uc2 At a booth sponsored by European Aerospace Defense Systems, the governor looked at how the company uses radar and cameras to monitor land. The company will be one of many vying for an upcoming government contract for fixed towers at immigration hot spots along the border, starting in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The contract is part of the government's latest strategy to secure the border.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has said the government will use existing, proven technology tailored to the distinct terrain and population density of each region of the nearly 2,000-mile U.S-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 She said that would provide faster technology deployment, better coverage and more bang for the buck. She also said the government learned its lesson from a failed high-tech border fence project ordered by Congress in 2006.\par \par \uc2 The nearly $1 billion program, initiated in 2005 and known as SBInet, was supposed to put a network of cameras, ground sensors and radars along the entire border.\par \par \uc2 Instead, taxpayers ended up with about 53 miles of operational "virtual fence" in Arizona for a cost of at least $15 million a mile, according to testimony in previous congressional hearings.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Amanda Lee Myers {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/AmandaLeeAP"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/AmandaLeeAP}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120307e8370006u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer blasted the federal government for failing to secure the U.S.-Mexico border while invoking the names of a slain rancher and Border Patrol agent on Tuesday at a major border-security expo being held in downtown Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to a room of law enforcement officers and those in the border technology industry, Brewer said the immigration issue isn't about hate or skin color, as her critics say -- it's about securing the border and keeping Americans safe.\par \par \uc2 "Of course, there are those in Washington who will tell you -- from 3,000 miles away, by the way -- that our border is more secure than ever," Brewer said. "No amount of distortion can hide the absolute truth. The federal government, Republicans and Democrats alike, have failed every single American, all of us."\par \par \uc2 She said Washington's "abdication of responsibility is the overarching outrage of American illegal immigration crisis."\par \par \uc2 "America's failure to understand this problem at a national level and to deal with it has haunted borders like mine for decades," she said.\par \par \uc2 Brewer pointed to the killings of rancher Rob Krentz and Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.\par \par \uc2 Authorities believe an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  killed Krentz while he was checking water lines on his property near the Arizona-Mexico border in March 2010.\par \par \uc2 Terry was killed in a shootout with border bandits in December 2010. A gun used in his shooting was connected to the botched federal operation known as Fast and Furious, in which agents lost track of nearly 1,400 of the more than 2,000 guns purchased by suspected straw buyers.\par \par \uc2 While Brewer was at the expo, she visited a number of booths where border-security companies displayed their wares in hopes that federal agents would like what they saw and help them win lucrative contracts.\par \par \uc2 On display were giant trucks equipped for border surveillance that are painted with eagles, all-terrain vehicles with spotlights, unmanned aerial drones, night-vision goggles and giant outdoor camouflaged monitoring centers.\par \par \uc2 In one booth that Brewer stopped at, by European Aerospace Defense Systems, the governor looked at how the company uses radar and cameras to monitor land.\par \par \uc2 The company will be one of many vying for an upcoming government contract for fixed towers at immigration hot spots along the border, starting in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The contract is part of the government's latest strategy to secure the border.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has said the government will use existing, proven technology tailored to the distinct terrain and population density of each region of the nearly 2,000-mile U.S-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 She said that would provide faster technology deployment, better coverage and more bang for the buck. She also said the government learned its lesson from a failed high-tech border fence project ordered by Congress in 2006.\par \par \uc2 The nearly $1 billion program, initiated in 2005 and known as SBInet, was supposed to put a network of cameras, ground sensors and radars along the entire border.\par \par \uc2 Instead, taxpayers ended up with about 53 miles of operational "virtual fence" in Arizona for a cost of at least $15 million a mile, according to testimony in previous congressional hearings.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Amanda Lee Myers {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/AmandaLeeAP"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/AmandaLeeAP}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120306e8360023j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) - A Texas man who pleaded guilty last year to bribing a state judge to change the terms of his probation was sentenced to 27 months in prison Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Armando Pena of Brownsville was the second person sentenced in the far-reaching federal corruption investigation of former state District Judge Abel Limas. Pena's case is just one example of the extent to which Limas used his elected position as a money-making venture.\par \par \uc2 Pena and his wife, who is scheduled to be sentenced next month on the same wire fraud charge, wired $1,800 from Arkansas to Harlingen in April 2008. The payment allegedly went through Limas middleman Jose Manuel Longoria and $1,500 made it to Limas.\par \par \uc2 Pena had moved to Arkansas without permission to work and wanted to be able to report to the state parole office by mail. Limas contacted that office and several weeks later issued a written order changing the terms of Pena's probation to allow him to do so. Pena had been given deferred adjudication on an aggravated robbery charge in state court. Now that case is expected to move ahead and Pena will face a minimum of five years in jail, said his attorney Rebecca RuBane.\par \par \uc2 Last month, a bail bondsman who paid $2,000 to bribe Limas was sentenced to 16 months in prison. The bribe was for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sentenced in 2003 to two years in prison and five years of supervised release on a drug charge. The indictment said Francisco Cisneros in 2008 paid to have the immigrant's bond changed from $25,000 to personal recognizance. Limas admitted receiving $700 to issue the order.\par \par \uc2 Several attorneys, one a former state lawmaker, also have been indicted in connection with Limas' scheme, paying bribes to win appointments or push the judge's discretion in favor of their clients. None of the cases have gone to trial so far.\par \par \uc2 Limas, who was on the bench from 2001 to 2008, pleaded guilty to racketeering last year and agreed to forfeit at least $257,300. His sentencing is scheduled for June.\par \par \uc2 In addition to the prison time, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen sentenced Pena to three years supervised release.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120306e836001a0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) - Agustin Portillo checks the oil in his wife's car, stores her luggage in her trunk and then drives her from his tiny apartment in Tijuana to the United States border entry port. It's not a long trip, but Ana Portillo is afraid to maneuver the streets of this violent city by herself.\par \par \uc2 They wait patiently in the hours-long security line, holding hands and stealing chaste kisses. A romantic ballad comes on the car radio, and Agustin faintly serenades his longtime bride. Ana tries not to notice when he tears up.\par \par \uc2 When they are near the checkpoint, he kisses her again before stepping out of the car. This is as far as he can go. After 20 years of living with his Ana in Los Angeles, he is stuck on the Mexican side of the fence.\par \par \uc2 Many assume an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  married to a U.S. citizen easily qualifies for a "green card" or legal U.S. residency. But Ana, an immigrant from El Salvador who is a U.S. citizen, and Agustin, a Mexican who lived illegally in the United States for decades, know the truth. They can live together in one of the poor, violent nations they fled, or they can live like this, divided.\par \par \uc2 The federal law that prohibits many illegal immigrants from living in the United States with their citizen spouses has been criticized by President Barack Obama, who recently ordered the State Department to allow some families to stay together. But it's unclear when that will happen or how many families it will help.\par \par \uc2 Agustin, 49, and Ana, 60, have been separated by the border for nearly two years. She misses his companionship and how he cared for her when she was sick. He longs to seek her counsel when something troubles him, to feel her warmth as they sleep\par \par \uc2 "Without her, I am practically nothing," he said.\par \par \uc2 He lives alone in Tijuana. She lives in a small Los Angeles apartment with her younger son, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and his family. Her other child, a legal resident, lives in Las Vegas. Her three grandchildren were all born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Every two weeks, she makes the 300-mile roundtrip from Los Angeles to Agustin's one-bedroom apartment in central Tijuana. There is no fridge, no sofa, no oven. He sleeps on an air mattress and stores his food in coolers filled with ice.\par \par \uc2 On a recent visit, she wore a revealing shirt for her husband. Her hair had been straightened and dyed black. His hair was gray, but his arms looked strong from frequent workouts to relieve his frustrations.\par \par \uc2 He sobbed as they embraced.\par \par \uc2 Agustin wants to be with his family, but not in Tijuana, where the U.S. State Department warns of narcotics-related violence.\par \par \uc2 It's a city where border crossers pray at the centuries-old Roman Catholic church for safe passage. In a bustling street, amid churro vendors and the painted donkey of this infamous metropolis, dour-looking men and women clutch dirty duffel bags. They are "Los Indocumentados," or the undocumented, people who haven't made it past the border.\par \par \uc2 "I am in the same position as them, waiting to cross to a better life and unable to do so," Agustin said as he and Ana stood near the crowded church on a recent afternoon.\par \par \uc2 Inside, they knelt and prayed.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 They were both illegal immigrants living in the same Los Angeles apartment complex when they met at a birthday party in 1988.\par \par \uc2 He traveled with her to El Salvador to help bring her two sons from a previous relationship to California. They were chased by border agents and threatened by highway robbers and drug dealers. The brutality of the trip cemented the bonds of their new family once they made it to the United States.\par \par \uc2 She took care of the children of affluent doctors while he sold cars or sewed clothes at a factory.\par \par \uc2 Ana and her sons soon qualified for visas under a temporary amnesty program that helped foreigners whose homelands were deemed unsafe. They could work and live in the U.S., but not travel abroad. The amnesty did not apply to Agustin.\par \par \uc2 Ana's older son graduated from high school with high marks, but couldn't afford to go to college because his non-resident status disqualified him from federal aid. His younger brother asked Ana and Agustin to take him out of advanced classes. What was the point, he said, if he couldn't go to college? It was one of many times Ana cried for her sons.\par \par \uc2 She obtained a permanent visa in 2001 and later became a U.S. citizen. Her older son in Las Vegas also sought a permanent visa, and his brother promised to do the same. Ana was hopeful everyone in her family would soon be free from "that fear that they will deport you at any time," she said.\par \par \uc2 But she was quickly reminded of how the law works.\par \par \uc2 Her nephew, a U.S. citizen, talked her younger son into going to Tijuana for his 21st birthday, reasoning that border officials, hearing him speak English, would think he was American. But when her son tried to return, the border officer wanted more than to hear him speak. His temporary visa didn't allow him re-entry and he no longer qualified for a permanent visa because he was caught trying to enter the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 A coyote, or an immigrant smuggler, was paid to fetch Ana's son, returning him to California.\par \par \uc2 Before 1996, illegal immigrants living in the United States could easily obtain visas or a "green card" if their spouse or parents were U.S. citizens or legal residents. But critics complained, and that year President Bill Clinton signed a law that banned illegal immigrants seeking visas from returning to the United States for up to 10 years.\par \par \uc2 Under federal law, visa applicants must return to their native country for a State Department interview. Many learn that they are banned during that meeting, when they are already outside the U.S. Those who are caught crossing the border or living in the United States after being deported can be banned for life.\par \par \uc2 Families can seek an "extreme hardship" waiver to avoid the ban. But the law does not define extreme hardship and case law suggests the U.S. government does not consider factors such as children or the potential loss to family income.\par \par \uc2 Under Obama's proposed overhaul, some immigrants would be able to seek a hardship waiver before departing to their native country for a visa interview.\par \par \uc2 Obama's plan doesn't need to be approved by Congress. Some Republicans say he is fishing for Hispanic votes ahead of the November election.\par \par \uc2 As it is, some 3.4 million illegal immigrants would likely qualify for visas because of their spouses or parents, but don't apply because they would be subject to the multi-year ban, said Muzaffar Chishti, an immigration lawyer with the Migration Policy Institute in New York.\par \par \uc2 Critics say illegal immigrants should face tough penalties. Some support a permanent ban for anyone living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "When I hear that the United States is tearing apart families, I really have a problem with that, because people have a choice," said David Seminara, a former State Department consular officer who opposes the hardship waivers in most cases.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Agustin's troubles started after he developed a hernia. He worried he could die without again seeing his older sisters in southern Mexico. He begged Ana to move back with him.\par \par \uc2 But she told him she couldn't earn what she does as a Los Angeles nanny, $500 a week. Mexico's per capita income is roughly one-third that, according to government figures.\par \par \uc2 So Agustin returned to his sisters. He was confident he could cross the border again whenever he wanted, as he had done when younger. After three months, he was ready to return to Los Angeles. But the border agents laughed at him when he tried to present a visa belonging to another man.\par \par \uc2 "Brother, you must think I'm an idiot," one agent said.\par \par \uc2 Agustin hired a coyote to take him into southern Arizona. They were almost there when a Border Patrol helicopter roared into the night sky. Agustin crawled into a ditch obscured by rocks. When the sound of the helicopter faded, he was alone and lost.\par \par \uc2 For hours, Agustin wandered through the desert as vultures circled. He thought he was dying of thirst when he came to a highway and a passing motorist offered him a ride to Tijuana. Since then, he's been too afraid to try again. Fear has also kept him from applying for legal entry.\par \par \uc2 "To see your family go and you can't go with them, it breaks your heart," he said.\par \par \uc2 And so he remains in Tijuana, where the border looms with thermal imaging surveillance cameras, patrolling aircraft and rows of strategically-placed walls, fences and watchtowers. Graffiti in English and Spanish covers the steel and concrete.\par \par \uc2 "This wall will not save your economy," reads one message.\par \par \uc2 "No wall can contain my heart," reads another.\par \par \uc2 The fence ends at the Pacific beach in western Tijuana. At sunset, with the orange bulb of the sun falling into the waves, the scene is almost romantic.\par \par \uc2 But not for Agustin and Ana, who read the angry messages as they walked arm-in-arm along the wall.\par \par \uc2 "This is where dreams die," Agustin said.\par \par \uc2 When he first began driving Ana to the border checkpoint at the end of their visits, Agustin would cry openly as she tried to console him in the hectic maze of taco stands, bass-thumping cars and makeshift tourist shops selling Virgin Mary statues.\par \par \uc2 "He used to tell me, `If only you could put me in your luggage,'" Ana recalled.\par \par \uc2 These days, he tries to more closely guard his emotions. He knows his tears upset her.\par \par \uc2 On her most recent trip, after Agustin left the car to walk back to his life in Tijuana, Ana handed her U.S. passport to a burly border officer. He cooed to her: You are so pretty. Do you have a boyfriend? He doesn't have papers, right?\par \par \uc2 "My husband," Ana replied.\par \par \uc2 The officer waved her forward.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120306e8360018k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW DELHI (AP) - There is almost no movement in the pre-dawn cold, when the winter fog sits low over the old city and the only light comes from distant street lamps. The parking lot is silent, except for the occasional hacking cough.\par \par \uc2 So it takes a while to realize there are nearly 100 people in the square of dirt on the edge of the cotton-sellers' district in the Indian capital. All are asleep in handmade wooden cots jammed one against the other. Dozens more people sleep around a battered empty fountain nearby.\par \par \uc2 In a few hours, workers will haul away the cots and Meena Bazaar Park No. 2 will fill with cars. By 9 a.m. the overnight community will have disappeared. Its residents will carry their meager possessions in plastic shopping bags until nightfall, when the lot once again will turn into a makeshift outdoor motel.\par \par \uc2 This is home. Some stay for one night. Others remain for decades, raising children who in turn raise their own children here.\par \par \uc2 For thousands of people struggling at the bottom of India's working class, this bleak vision and the handful of places like it scattered across New Delhi are 60-cent-a-night refuges.\par \par \uc2 Every day, thousands of new residents arrive in this constantly growing city, part of a nationwide wave of urbanization bringing tens of millions of migrants from India's poorest states. In New Delhi, most of the new arrivals go into the city's sprawling slums, or into the maze of crumbling concrete neighborhoods where rents are cheap.\par \par \uc2 But many come here. Even a tin shanty can cost upward of $75 a month in New Delhi, an amount that would take many of the parking lot's residents weeks to earn. Few of them hold regular jobs, or earn more than $4 a day.\par \par \uc2 Then there are the identity documents that police demand in regular sweeps through the slums. Anyone without proper paperwork, whether an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Bangladesh or an Indian with excessively tattered documents, faces constant demands for bribes.\par \par \uc2 The police rarely bother with Meena Bazaar Park No. 2, a place so cheap it largely operates off the legal radar.\par \par \uc2 The people asleep in the parking lot are day laborers, professional beggars and itinerant peddlers who sell costume jewelry from vinyl suitcases. They are rural dreamers looking for better lives, illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and small-town boys who fled their homes after falling in love with the wrong girls. There are pious Muslims and once-proud men stumbling into opium addiction.\par \par \uc2 While most residents are men, there are also babies and old people and a litter of puppies huddled in one man's blanket. They warm up by burning piles of garbage, and the stench of charred plastic clings to their clothes.\par \par \uc2 "I need this place," said Satpal Singh, a 24-year-old who earns $3 a day as a waiter during the city's tumultuous wedding season. "Where am I going to find a house in this city?"\par \par \uc2 The son of a tenant farmer, Singh came to New Delhi 10 years ago because he couldn't find work in his home village, in a poverty-ravaged area about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away. Like many residents, he spends part of the year in New Delhi, working when he can, and goes back to his home village when the jobs trail off.\par \par \uc2 If the parking lot doesn't seem much like a home, Singh insisted it's not that bad. "I've been here for a long time, so I'm used to it," he said. Plus: "For just 30 rupees (60 cents) a night I even get a blanket."\par \par \uc2 It was a cold morning, and Singh spoke with just his head poking out from beneath a thick, cotton quilt. He was strangely oblivious to the cigarette smoke drifting from under the quilt at the foot of the cot.\par \par \uc2 Eventually, another man's head appeared, the hair greasy and mussed, and a cheap cigarette held between his lips.\par \par \uc2 It was Mohammed Rasheed, also 24. The two longtime friends share an easy camaraderie, as well as a bed on the coldest nights. It keeps them warmer, and cuts the cost to just 30 cents a person.\par \par \uc2 It's how things work in the community of migrants.\par \par \uc2 "I know these people," Singh said, nodding toward the beds around him. "We eat food together. We sleep here together. We know each others' stories."\par \par \uc2 But few people would choose to live here if they had another choice, particularly the families. Parents have to take young children with them to work, often leaving them to play on construction sites or in alleyways. If there is no money for school, children are often sent to work before they even reach adolescence.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a place for a family," said Mohammad Muzaffar, who came to the parking lot 15 or 20 years ago -- he's not sure how long it's been -- and is now raising two toddlers there with his wife, Reshma. But Muzaffar, who works as a wedding-season waiter and a rickshaw driver, has no identity papers. He sees no way to get his family into an apartment.\par \par \uc2 "We are poor people," Reshma said, explaining why their children will grow up there. "We don't have anything."\par \par \uc2 No one seems to know how long these outdoor motels have been around. Many of the city's housing advocates do not even know they exist, given the way they disappear after daybreak.\par \par \uc2 But their need is essential.\par \par \uc2 With India's surging economy drawing ever more rural residents to its cities, the country's housing shortage has become critical.\par \par \uc2 A 2010 study by the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that India then faced a shortage of 25 million urban households, a number that could leap to 38 million by 2030. More than 8 million people -- or about half of New Delhi's 16.7 million people -- are believed to live in slums.\par \par \uc2 "There isn't a mechanism to house the people who are coming," Ajit Mohan, one of the report's authors, said in an interview. "You have to plan for something like this five, 10 or 15 years in advance, and that's not going on."\par \par \uc2 Government officials, he said, "haven't embraced affordable housing as something they have to deliver."\par \par \uc2 So places like the Meena Bazaar camp have sprung up to feed the demand.\par \par \uc2 In summer, thousands of people crowd New Delhi's outdoor motels. In winter -- New Delhi winters get surprisingly cold for such a hot climate, with temperatures sometimes falling to just above freezing -- the crowds thin out as people return to their home villages or find warmer places to sleep.\par \par \uc2 Eventually, the lucky find better places to live. But no matter how many people move out, there are always more ready to move in.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120306e836000mm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate passes immigration colleges bill\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATE BRUMBACK   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 915 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 March 2012\par 19:49\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - The Georgia Senate voted Monday to approve a bill aimed at barring \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students from state colleges, universities and technical schools.\par \par \uc2 Senate Bill 458, approved by a 34-to-19 vote, also would tweak other state laws dealing with illegal immigration. During nearly two hours of discussion, lawmakers focused mostly on illegal immigrants' access to higher education before voting on the bill.\par \par \uc2 The bill now heads to the House. A House committee held a hearing in January on a bill that would bar illegal immigrants from state higher education institutions, but its members have not voted on that bill.\par \par \uc2 The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barry Loudermilk, R-Cassville, said it has stirred up a lot of controversy, but he said it simply aims to correct some unintended consequences and to clarify the legislative intent of previously passed laws.\par \par \uc2 "This bill is not about education," Loudermilk said, adding that it's about taxpayer-funded benefits going to people who are in the country illegally. He pointed out that illegal immigrants can still attend private institutions in the state.\par \par \uc2 Democrats released a minority report on the bill Monday calling the legislation unnecessary, fundamentally unfair and economically shortsighted.\par \par \uc2 "Increasing the number of college graduates who earn higher wages generates higher sales, property, and income taxes," Sen. Vincent Fort of Atlanta wrote in the report. "Denying these students access to higher education will cost Georgia money in the long-term."\par \par \uc2 Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers, R-Woodstock, said federal law bars illegal immigrants from receiving public benefits, including postsecondary education, unless a state passes a law to the contrary. Georgia has no such law, he said.\par \par \uc2 The new bill would clarify the intent of a law he sponsored in 2006 that he said should have been interpreted as prohibiting state colleges and universities from accepting illegal immigrants, he said.\par \par \uc2 The original version of the bill that passed the Senate Monday included postsecondary education on a list identifying public benefits, but an amendment proposed by Loudermilk and adopted before the vote on the bill removed postsecondary education from that list. Supporters of the bill said it doesn't need to be on the list because it's included in the federal definition of public benefits.\par \par \uc2 But the state university system does not believe illegal immigrants receive a public benefit via postsecondary education because they must pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 "We have interpreted that to mean the benefit is in-state tuition because that is subsidized by the taxpayers," university system spokesman \uc2 John Millsaps\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Loudermilk said in a statement after the vote that the university system Board of Regents is incorrectly interpreting federal policy by allowing illegal immigrants to attend state colleges and universities.\par \par \uc2 "The key word to remember in this legislation is `illegal,'" he said. "I truly do feel compassion for anyone who will be impacted by this legislation, and I applaud anyone who wants to work towards a college degree. Nevertheless, this should not be an exception to following the due process of law."\par \par \uc2 Only South Carolina currently prohibits state colleges and universities from admitting illegal immigrants. A section of Alabama's tough new law targeting illegal immigration that would have done the same has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.\par \par \uc2 "Why do we want to put Georgia in the posture of standing in the schoolhouse door?" asked Sen. Nan Orrock, D-Atlanta, drawing a parallel to the desegregation of public colleges in the 1960s.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants already are effectively barred from the most competitive state schools because of a Board of Regents policy created in 2010 that prohibits any institution that has rejected academically qualified applicants in the previous two years from accepting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 That includes the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Georgia Health Sciences University and Georgia College & State University. Illegal immigrants may still be admitted to any other state college or university but must pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 University system Chancellor Hank Huckaby has told Senate and House committees that he does not believe such legislation is necessary and that current board policy is sufficient.\par \par \uc2 The Senate bill also seeks to adjust some identification requirements from last year's law for applicants for public benefits, which include food stamps and professional licenses.\par \par \uc2 Applicants must provide a "secure and verifiable" document proving their legal presence in the country. Some agencies -- including Secretary of State Brian Kemp's office, which handles many professional licenses -- expressed concern the requirement would cause extra work for his staff that could delay issuing or renewing licenses.\par \par \uc2 The new legislation says applicants may submit their documents within nine months of the application deadline, as long as the documents are still valid when the public benefit is administered and for the duration of the benefit. The bill also says U.S. citizens renewing an application for a public benefit do not need to resubmit documents each time they apply to renew a benefit with the same agency. Applicants who are not U.S. citizens would have to submit the docuements each time they apply.\par \par \uc2 Last year's law required the state attorney general to create a list of acceptable, secure and verifiable documents. Attorney General Sam Olens' list included passports issued by a foreign government. Under the new legislation, foreign passports would only be acceptable if submitted with valid federal immigration paperwork saying the person is in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120306e8360009r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) - Agustin Portillo checks the oil in his wife's car, stores her luggage in her trunk and then drives her from his tiny apartment in Tijuana to the United States border entry port. It's not a long trip, but Ana Portillo is afraid to maneuver the streets of this violent city by herself.\par \par \uc2 They wait patiently in the hours-long security line, holding hands and stealing chaste kisses. A romantic ballad comes on the car radio, and Agustin faintly serenades his longtime bride. Ana tries not to notice when he tears up.\par \par \uc2 When they are near the checkpoint, he kisses her again before stepping out of the car. This is as far as he can go. After 20 years of living with his Ana in Los Angeles, he is stuck on the Mexican side of the fence.\par \par \uc2 Many assume an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  married to a U.S. citizen easily qualifies for a "green card" or legal U.S. residency. But Ana, an immigrant from El Salvador who is a U.S. citizen, and Agustin, a Mexican who lived illegally in the United States for decades, know the truth. They can live together in one of the poor, violent nations they fled, or they can live like this, divided.\par \par \uc2 The federal law that prohibits many illegal immigrants from living in the United States with their citizen spouses has been criticized by President Barack Obama, who recently ordered the State Department to allow some families to stay together. But it's unclear when that will happen or how many families it will help.\par \par \uc2 Agustin, 49, and Ana, 60, have been separated by the border for nearly two years. She misses his companionship and how he cared for her when she was sick. He longs to seek her counsel when something troubles him, to feel her warmth as they sleep\par \par \uc2 "Without her, I am practically nothing," he said.\par \par \uc2 He lives alone in Tijuana. She lives in a small Los Angeles apartment with her younger son, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and his family. Her other child, a legal resident, lives in Las Vegas. Her three grandchildren were all born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Every two weeks, she makes the 300-mile roundtrip from Los Angeles to Agustin's one-bedroom apartment in central Tijuana. There is no fridge, no sofa, no oven. He sleeps on an air mattress and stores his food in coolers filled with ice.\par \par \uc2 On a recent visit, she wore a revealing animal-print shirt for her husband. Her hair had been straightened and dyed black. His hair was gray, but his arms looked strong from frequent workouts to relieve his frustrations.\par \par \uc2 He sobbed as they embraced.\par \par \uc2 Agustin wants to be with his family, but not in Tijuana, where the U.S. State Department warns of narcotics-related violence.\par \par \uc2 It's a city where border crossers pray at the centuries-old Roman Catholic church for safe passage. In a bustling street, amid churro vendors and the painted donkey of this infamous metropolis, dour-looking men and women clutch dirty duffel bags. They are "Los Indocumentados," or the undocumented, people who haven't made it past the border.\par \par \uc2 "I am in the same position as them, waiting to cross to a better life and unable to do so," Agustin said as he and Ana approached the crowded church on a recent afternoon.\par \par \uc2 Inside, they knelt and prayed.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 They were both illegal immigrants living in the same Los Angeles apartment complex when they met at a birthday party in 1988.\par \par \uc2 He traveled with her to El Salvador to help bring her two sons from a previous relationship to California. They were chased by border agents and threatened by highway robbers and drug dealers. The brutality of the trip cemented the bonds of their new family once they made it to the United States.\par \par \uc2 She took care of the children of affluent doctors while he sold cars or sewed clothes at a factory.\par \par \uc2 Ana and her sons soon qualified for visas under a temporary amnesty program that helped foreigners whose homelands were deemed unsafe. They could work and live in the U.S., but not travel abroad. The amnesty did not apply to Agustin.\par \par \uc2 Ana's older son graduated from high school with high marks, but couldn't afford to go to college because his non-resident status disqualified him from federal aid. His younger brother asked Ana and Agustin to take him out of advanced classes. What was the point, he said, if he couldn't go to college? It was one of many times Ana cried for her sons.\par \par \uc2 She obtained a permanent visa in 2001 and later became a U.S. Citizen. Her older son in Las Vegas also sought a permanent visa, and his brother promised to do the same. Ana was hopeful everyone in her family would soon be free from "that fear that they will deport you at any time," she said.\par \par \uc2 But she was quickly reminded of how the law works.\par \par \uc2 Her nephew, a U.S. citizen, talked her younger son into going to Tijuana for his 21st birthday, reasoning that border officials, hearing him speak English, would think he was American. But when her son tried to return, the Border Patrol officer wanted more than to hear him speak. His temporary visa didn't allow him re-entry and he no longer qualified for a permanent visa because he was caught trying to enter the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 A coyote, or an immigrant smuggler, was paid to fetch Ana's son, returning him to California.\par \par \uc2 Before 1996, illegal immigrants living in the United States could easily obtain visas or a "green card" if their spouse or parents were U.S. citizens or legal residents. But critics complained, and that year President Bill Clinton signed a law that banned illegal immigrants seeking visas from returning to the United States for up to 10 years.\par \par \uc2 Under federal law, visa applicants must return to their native country for a State Department interview. Many learn that they are banned during that meeting, when they are already outside the U.S. Those who are caught crossing the border or living in the United States after being deported can be banned for life.\par \par \uc2 Families can seek an "extreme hardship" waiver to avoid the ban. But the law does not define extreme hardship and case law suggests the U.S. government does not consider factors such as children or the potential loss to family income.\par \par \uc2 Under Obama's proposed overhaul, some immigrants would be able to seek a hardship waiver before departing to their native country for a visa interview.\par \par \uc2 Obama's plan doesn't need to be approved by Congress. Some Republicans say he is fishing for Hispanic votes ahead of the November election.\par \par \uc2 As it is, some 3.4 million illegal immigrants would likely qualify for visas because of their spouses or parents, but don't apply because they would be subject to the multi-year ban, said Muzaffar Chishti, an immigration lawyer with the Migration Policy Institute in New York.\par \par \uc2 Critics say illegal immigrants should face tough penalties. Many support a permanent ban for anyone living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "When I hear that the United States is tearing apart families, I really have a problem with that, because people have a choice," said David Seminara, a former State Department consular officer who opposes the hardship waivers.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Agustin's troubles started after he developed a hernia. He worried he could die without again seeing his older sisters in southern Mexico. He begged Ana to move back with him.\par \par \uc2 But she told him she couldn't earn what she does as a Los Angeles nanny, $500 a week. Mexico's per capita income is roughly one-third that, according to government figures.\par \par \uc2 So Agustin returned to his sisters. He was confident he could cross the border again whenever he wanted, as he had done when younger. After three months, he was ready to return to Los Angeles. But the Border Patrol agents laughed at him when he tried to present a visa belonging to another man.\par \par \uc2 "Brother, you must think I'm an idiot," one agent said.\par \par \uc2 Agustin hired a coyote to take him into southern Arizona. They were almost there when a Border Patrol helicopter roared into the night sky. Agustin crawled into a ditch obscured by rocks. When the sound of the helicopter faded, he was alone and lost.\par \par \uc2 For hours, Agustin wandered through the desert as vultures circled. He thought he was dying of thirst when he came to a highway and a passing motorist offered him a ride to Tijuana. Since then, he's been too afraid to try again. Fear has also kept him from applying for legal entry.\par \par \uc2 "To see your family go and you can't go with them, it breaks your heart," he said.\par \par \uc2 And so he remains in Tijuana, where the border looms with thermal imaging surveillance cameras, patrolling aircraft and rows of strategically-placed walls, fences and watchtowers. Graffiti in English and Spanish covers the steel and concrete.\par \par \uc2 "This wall will not save your economy," reads one message.\par \par \uc2 "No wall can contain my heart," reads another.\par \par \uc2 The fence ends at the Pacific beach in western Tijuana. At sunset, with the orange bulb of the sun falling into the waves, the scene is almost romantic.\par \par \uc2 But not for Agustin and Ana, who read the angry messages as they walked arm-in-arm along the wall.\par \par \uc2 "This is where dreams die," Agustin said.\par \par \uc2 When he first began driving Ana to the border checkpoint at the end of their visits, Agustin would cry openly as she tried to console him in the hectic maze of taco stands, bass-thumping cars and makeshift tourist shops selling Virgin Mary statues.\par \par \uc2 "He used to tell me, `If only you could put me in your luggage,'" Ana recalled.\par \par \uc2 These days, he tries to more closely guard his emotions. He knows his tears upset her.\par \par \uc2 On her most recent trip, after Agustin left the car to walk back to his life in Tijuana, Ana handed her U.S. passport to a burly Border Patrol officer. He cooed to her: You are so pretty. Do you have a boyfriend? He doesn't have papers, right?\par \par \uc2 "My husband," Ana replied.\par \par \uc2 The officer waved her forward.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120305e835001z9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc89}{\*\bkmkend toc89}\b \uc2 Ga. Senate votes to pass bill aimed at barring illegal immigrants from state colleges\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATE BRUMBACK   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 864 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 March 2012\par 18:22\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - The Georgia Senate voted Monday to approve a bill aimed at barring \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students from state colleges, universities and technical schools.\par \par \uc2 Senate Bill 458, approved by a 34-to-19 vote, also would tweak other state laws dealing with illegal immigration. During nearly two hours of discussion, lawmakers focused mostly on illegal immigrants' access to higher education before voting on the bill.\par \par \uc2 The bill now heads to the House. A House committee held a hearing in January on a bill that would bar illegal immigrants from state higher education institutions, but its members have not voted on that bill.\par \par \uc2 The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barry Loudermilk, R-Cassville, said it has stirred up a lot of controversy, but he said it simply aims to correct some unintended consequences and to clarify the legislative intent of previously passed laws.\par \par \uc2 "This bill is not about education," Loudermilk said, adding that it's about taxpayer-funded benefits going to people who are in the country illegally. He pointed out that illegal immigrants can still attend private institutions in the state.\par \par \uc2 Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers, R-Woodstock, said federal law bars illegal immigrants from receiving public benefits, including postsecondary education, unless a state passes a law to the contrary. Georgia has no such law, he said.\par \par \uc2 The new bill would clarify the intent of a law he sponsored in 2006 that he said should have been interpreted as prohibiting state colleges and universities from accepting illegal immigrants, he said.\par \par \uc2 The original version of the bill that passed the Senate Monday included postsecondary education on a list identifying public benefits, but an amendment proposed by Loudermilk and adopted before the vote on the bill removed postsecondary education from that list. Supporters of the bill said it doesn't need to be on the list because it's included in the federal definition of public benefits.\par \par \uc2 But the state university system does not believe illegal immigrants receive a public benefit via postsecondary education because they must pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 "We have interpreted that to mean the benefit is in-state tuition because that is subsidized by the taxpayers," university system spokesman \uc2 John Millsaps\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Loudermilk said in a statement after the vote that the university system Board of Regents is incorrectly interpreting federal policy by allowing illegal immigrants to attend state colleges and universities.\par \par \uc2 "The key word to remember in this legislation is `illegal,'" he said. "I truly do feel compassion for anyone who will be impacted by this legislation, and I applaud anyone who wants to work towards a college degree. Nevertheless, this should not be an exception to following the due process of law."\par \par \uc2 Only South Carolina currently prohibits state colleges and universities from admitting illegal immigrants. A section of Alabama's tough new law targeting illegal immigration that would have done the same has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.\par \par \uc2 "Why do we want to put Georgia in the posture of standing in the schoolhouse door?" asked Sen. Nan Orrock, D-Atlanta, drawing a parallel to the desegregation of public colleges in the 1960s.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants already are effectively barred from the most competitive state schools because of a Board of Regents policy created in 2010 that prohibits any institution that has rejected academically qualified applicants in the previous two years from accepting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 That includes the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Georgia Health Sciences University and Georgia College & State University. Illegal immigrants may still be admitted to any other state college or university but must pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 University system Chancellor Hank Huckaby has told Senate and House committees that he does not believe such legislation is necessary and that current board policy is sufficient.\par \par \uc2 The Senate bill also seeks to adjust some identification requirements from last year's law for applicants for public benefits, which include food stamps and professional licenses.\par \par \uc2 Applicants must provide a "secure and verifiable" document proving their legal presence in the country. Some agencies -- including Secretary of State Brian Kemp's office, which handles many professional licenses -- expressed concern the requirement would cause extra work for his staff that could delay issuing or renewing licenses.\par \par \uc2 The new legislation says applicants may submit their documents within nine months of the application deadline, as long as the documents are still valid when the public benefit is administered and for the duration of the benefit.

Applicants who are not U.S. citizens would have to submit the docuements each time they apply.\par \par \uc2 Last year's law required the state attorney general to create a list of acceptable, secure and verifiable documents.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - A federal agent who was killed after shooting his supervisor in a workplace confrontation in California had been the subject of complaints by immigrant advocates for allegedly using coercive tactics with immigrants after a 2010 raid, according to court papers filed on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 In an amended complaint, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California asked a federal court in Los Angeles to order Immigration and Customs Enforcement to turn over records related to a worksite raid overseen by agent Ezequiel Garcia.\par \par \uc2 An ACLU attorney had complained more than a year ago that Garcia arrested a worker for failing to disclose her immigration status in an interview with investigators following the raid at Orange County's \uc2 Terra Universal Inc\uc2 . Garcia also arrested another worker months later on what may have been a retaliatory tip from his recent employer, the court papers alleged.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU said the recent workplace violence at ICE's Long Beach office involving Garcia underscored the need to get more information about the Terra raid.\par \par \uc2 "It will further contribute to the public's understanding of whether ICE took disciplinary or supervisory action upon receiving complaints about Mr. Garcia's conduct or other unlawful or abusive conduct in connection with the Terra worksite raid," the ACLU said in papers filed on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Garcia, who was promoted to supervisor in 2004, was being counseled on his job performance on Feb. 16 when he shot and wounded Kevin Kozak, ICE Homeland Security Investigations' second-in-command for the Los Angeles area. Another agent pulled out his gun and shot and killed Garcia.\par \par \uc2 ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice declined to comment on the shooting, citing the pending investigation.\par \par \uc2 A federal official with knowledge of the investigation previously told The Associated Press that Kozak had denied a request for an internal transfer request by Garcia. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly.\par \par \uc2 Garcia joined INS in 1988. Shortly after the Department of Homeland Security was created in 2003, he was promoted to supervisor for a documents and benefits fraud task force.\par \par \uc2 According to the ACLU, Garcia was the lead agent in charge of the raid at the Fullerton, Calif.-based manufacturer where immigration agents arrested 43 workers.\par \par \uc2 A week later, Garcia interviewed several workers at ICE's offices in Santa Ana, including one who remained silent during questioning. In turn, Garcia arrested her and she spent a day and a half in immigration detention, the ACLU alleged in court papers.\par \par \uc2 Afterward, ACLU attorney Jennie Pasquarella wrote a letter to ICE director John Morton complaining about Garcia's behavior. An official wrote back indicating the agency would not seek to deport the woman, Pasquarella said.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU sued Terra in 2010, accusing the company of bilking immigrant workers out of pay and violating their rights. After filing, Garcia went to the house of one of the named plaintiffs and arrested him, noting he had been tipped off by a Terra manager that the man had not previously been detained, the court papers allege.\par \par \uc2 In a statement in 2010, Kice said that the worker arrested after the raid had been identified through the government's investigation of Terra as a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  but he fled the premises during the raid. She also said the government's priority was to focus on the conduct of Terra.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Labor also filed a suit against Terra and settled last year, winning nearly $374,000 in back wages for the workers.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week, Terra's owner \uc2 George Sadaghiani\uc2  agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of hiring illegal immigrants in papers filed in federal court.\par \par \uc2 Some of the workers arrested in the raid face deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the ACLU filed a lawsuit after the government denied its application for a fee waiver to obtain records related to the Terra raid and assessed more than $10,000 in search fees.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120302e832000hn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A federal appeals court pressed Georgia and Alabama attorneys Thursday on whether the states' new laws targeting illegal immigration conflict with federal rules and challenged critics of the crackdown to explain why local authorities can't use the measures to complement federal efforts. But the judges said they would wait for the outcome of a separate U.S. Supreme Court case before ruling.\par \par \uc2 The three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments on two lawsuits opposing Alabama's law, one filed by immigrant rights and civil liberties groups and the other filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, and also heard arguments on a challenge to Georgia's new law filed by activist groups.\par \par \uc2 The panel made it clear it wouldn't rule until the U.S. Supreme Court releases a decision on a federal government challenge to a similar law passed by Arizona. The arguments in that case, set for April, revolve around a sweeping law taking aim at illegal immigration passed in 2010 that was opposed by activist groups and the federal government. A decision is expected by early summer.\par \par \uc2 Circuit Judges Bev Martin and Charles Wilson peppered attorneys from both states with questions about whether their state laws pre-empt federal rules. Alabama's law is widely considered the toughest in the nation. The judges raised multiple questions about the effects of a section of that law prohibiting courts from enforcing contracts involving illegal immigrants and another section that requires schools to ask about students' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 First, however, the court reviewed the Georgia law. State attorney Devon Orland urged the panel to view the state law as a supplement to federal statutes that allow "dual enforcement," much like laws that allow both state and federal prosecutors to charge suspects with drug crimes.\par \par \uc2 "It's axiomatic that both the state and the federal government can both prosecute the same crime," she argued, adding that the law's intent is not to "persecute people."\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the measure argued that immigration is a federal issue that shouldn't be governed by a patchwork of state laws. Omar Jadwat of the American Civil Liberties Union said the law forces "police officers to take off their police officer's hat and put on an immigration enforcement hat."\par \par \uc2 Wilson asked him whether a state can seek to regulate illegal immigration if it decides the "illegal alien population morphs into a public safety concern." Jadwat countered that it should be up to federal officials to address the issue.\par \par \uc2 Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said the court is wise to delay its decision until after the Supreme Court rules in the Arizona case. He added that the federal government needs to act on immigration.\par \par \uc2 "The judges asked tough questions of both sides, which is appropriate," he said. "States wouldn't be passing these laws if the federal government did its job. The states are crying out for such action by passing these laws."\par \par \uc2 Jadwat called the hearing "a good airing of the issues."\par \par \uc2 Later, in the arguments over the federal challenge to the Alabama law, U.S. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Beth Brinkmann said it "attacks every aspect of an alien's life and makes it impossible for an alien to live," and it regulates immigration in violation of the federal government's exclusive authority in that area.\par \par \uc2 Alabama Solicitor General John Neiman said his state was acting within its right to help the federal government enforce laws and said the statute doesn't usurp the federal government's authority to deport illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "These laws certainly can have the effect of making certain states places where illegal aliens would be more likely to go," he said, referring to states that don't choose to enact such laws.\par \par \uc2 Martin asked if the section requiring schools to check the immigration status of students was a scare tactic.\par \par \uc2 Neiman flatly denied that and said it was intended "to get data on the makeup of the students in our schools."\par \par \uc2 In arguments over the activist groups' challenge to the Alabama law, Cecillia Wang with the ACLU said the section that effectively bars illegal immigrants from entering into contracts, including leases, would make it virtually impossible for illegal immigrants to live in the state, even if they were awaiting the outcome of their immigration case or requesting asylum and had been cleared by federal authorities to stay.\par \par \uc2 Since the law includes exceptions for arranging transportation out of the state and consuming food on the spot, the message sent by that provision, she said, is "You can pass through but you had best be gone by morning."\par \par \uc2 Alabama Deputy Solicitor General Prim Escalona argued that the law is "intended to cooperate with the federal government."\par \par \uc2 Wang also asked the court not to wait for the outcome of the Supreme Court's decision in the Alabama case to block parts of Alabama's law that have already taken effect because she said people "are suffering ongoing harm" as a result of the law.\par \par \uc2 The three-judge panel also included U.S. District Judge Richard Voorhees, a visiting judge from North Carolina who asked few questions during the hearing. Wilson and Martin were appointed by Democratic presidents while Voorhees was tapped by Republican Ronald Reagan.\par \par \uc2 Five states -- Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah -- adopted variations on Arizona's law last year. All five laws have been challenged by coalitions of civil rights and immigrant rights groups, and the federal government has sued to block those in Alabama, South Carolina and Utah.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge in June temporarily blocked parts of Georgia's law pending the outcome of the legal challenge filed by the activist groups. One blocked section would authorize police to check the immigration status of suspects who lack proper identification. The other would create a state penalty for people who knowingly and willingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants while committing another crime.\par \par \uc2 The section of the Alabama law that requires schools to check students' immigration status was among parts temporarily blocked in October. But a section that allows police to check a person's immigration status during a traffic stop and to detain someone they believe is in the country illegally remains in effect. The section involving contracts and another that makes it a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state for basic things such as getting a driver's license are also being enforced.\par \par \uc2 The arguments attracted national media and dozens of protesters, who rallied outside the downtown Atlanta courtroom chanting slogans and holding signs saying: "We are families not fugitives" and "Hate Hurts Alabama."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120301e83100122\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Arizona voters for the second time in four months have signaled an apparent softening in their hardline stance against illegal immigration, a trend that could change the tone of debate on the topic as presidential candidates head into the general election.\par \par \uc2 Exit poll results showing the issue has dropped in importance among GOP voters should send Republicans a message that immigration is an issue "they should tread lightly with," said Jill Hanauer, a former Democratic strategist and founder of Project New America, a Denver-based research group.\par \par \uc2 But Jennifer Korn, executive director of the Republican-funded Hispanic Leadership Network, said the topic likely will still dominate political debate during the general election.\par \par \uc2 "It will still be an issue because President Obama has now said Arizona is on the map for (Democrats), and they have offices already open," Korn said. "Even though I don't think it will become a swing state, it will make the Republican candidate have to spend more money and time ... especially engaging the Hispanic community to make sure they are not turned off by their position."\par \par \uc2 Only 13 percent of Arizona Republican voters called immigration the most important issue in Tuesday's presidential primary, results from an exit poll showed, down 10 points from the percentage of voters who called it the most important issue in the 2008 Republican primary. The top concerns were the economy and the federal budget deficit.\par \par \uc2 Arizona voters were divided almost evenly in thirds when asked if \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers should be deported, allowed to stay as temporary workers or offered a chance to apply for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The split was somewhat surprising, said Barbara Norrander, a University of Arizona political science professor.\par \par \uc2 "You might have thought it would have been a strong sentiment for deporting," she said from Tucson. "That just shows it's a more complicated issue than it's been publicized as."\par \par \uc2 She also noted that Arizona "is a state where we have probably more close relationships with a wide variety of immigrants and experiences, so we've probably had more contact with someone who might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and we understand perhaps a need for some temporary workers in positions that might not be filled otherwise."\par \par \uc2 The results come on the heels of November election where Arizona voters recalled the Republican legislator who sponsored Arizona's tough anti-immigration law. Voters also elected Democratic mayors in Phoenix and Tucson. That sparked renewed hope among Democrats for picking up the state in next year's Senate and presidential elections.\par \par \uc2 Immigration had dominated some of the earlier debates in the heated Republican primary, with candidates vying for the endorsement of extreme anti-immigration policy advocates like Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and increasingly positioning themselves farther and farther to the right on the issue. More recently, however, immigration reform and talk of building fences and deporting all illegal workers has taken a back seat to the economy and social issues.\par \par \uc2 Even during the recent Arizona debate the issue came up only after the moderator specifically asked candidates their views.\par \par \uc2 Exit polls conducted for The Associated Press have shown the issue ranks near the bottom of important issues for voters in most states that have held primaries.\par \par \uc2 But as the focus in the general election turns to the large groups of Hispanic and independent, Korn said it could again take center stage in states like Arizona, where she said Obama is expected to focus on the Republican candidate's primary stance while the eventual nominee will likely paint Obama as having broken his promise to Hispanics to deliver real immigration reforms.\par \par \uc2 Arizona voters are split in almost equal thirds between Republicans, independents and Democrats, although Republicans have a slight lead. Hispanics account for about 30 percent of the population.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona presidential primary results, according to Chris Herstam, a Republican political analyst and lobbyist, "demonstrate that Arizona Republicans are becoming more educated on the immigration issue. A certain amount of fatigue has settled in on the issue and they are willing to take a more pragmatic approach."\par \par \uc2 However, an Arizona legislator who has sponsored legislation to crack down on illegal immigration dismissed the exit-poll question as biased and inadequate to shed light on a complex issue.\par \par \uc2 Rep. John Kavanagh said the question was biased because it asked what should be done about \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers, not illegal immigrants in general.\par \par \uc2 The Fountain Hills Republican and other critics of illegal immigration have said the state shouldn't be burdened with costs of education, health care and other social services for illegal immigrants and their children.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration has been overshadowed as a political issue because of the current focus on the economy, Kavanagh said. "But the problem is still there."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120229e82t001y9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - When a federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday in the legal challenges against tough new laws targeting illegal immigration in Alabama and Georgia, people outside of those two states will be paying attention.\par \par \uc2 The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments on two separate challenges to Alabama's law, one filed by immigrant rights and civil liberties groups and the other filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. The three-judge panel will also hear arguments on a challenge to Georgia's new law filed by activist groups.\par \par \uc2 In the case pitting Alabama against the federal government, the attorneys general in nine other states -- Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma and South Carolina -- have filed an amicus brief supporting the state of Alabama. They say in the brief that they "have a manifest interest in ensuring that their sovereignty is accorded proper respect."\par \par \uc2 The Atlanta appeals court has jurisdiction over Georgia, Florida and Alabama. But the opinions the court releases could also influence judges in other jurisdictions and demonstrate to lawmakers what provisions federal courts are likely to accept or reject.\par \par \uc2 Under consideration by the federal judges are provisions that include one that would allow Georgia police to check the immigration status of certain suspects and another requiring Alabama schools to check students' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt joined the amicus brief because "the case involves an important federalism and state sovereignty issue," said Pruitt spokesman Diane Clay.\par \par \uc2 "The court is not considering whether Alabama's immigration law is good or bad, but whether a state is allowed to enact such laws," Clay wrote in email to The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 Florida's Attorney General Pam Bondi, another advocate of state sovereignty, said states need to be able to implement their own solutions to problems.\par \par \uc2 "The Attorney General supports defending the ability of each state to decide for itself how to protect its citizens from the crime and costs associated with illegal immigration," Bondi spokeswoman Jenn Meale said.\par \par \uc2 Foreign governments -- including Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru -- have also filed amicus briefs opposing the laws in both the Alabama and Georgia cases.\par \par \uc2 Mexico said in a brief opposing Georgia's law that it would strain diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Mexico, "interfering with the strategic diplomatic interests of the two countries and encouraging an imminent threat of state-sanctioned bias or discrimination." The federal government has made a similar argument in its court filings against Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Thursday's oral arguments come as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in April on a federal government challenge to a similar law passed by Arizona. That state in 2010 became the first to pass such a sweeping law taking aim at illegal immigration. That law was challenged by both activist groups and the federal government. After a federal court blocked parts of the law and a federal appeals court upheld that decision, Arizona appealed to the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 A decision in the Arizona case before the U.S. high court is expected by early summer. It's not known whether the 11th Circuit will wait for that decision to issue opinions in the Georgia and Alabama cases since some similar issues are on the table.\par \par \uc2 Five other states -- Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah -- adopted variations on the law last year, with Alabama's widely considered the toughest in the nation. All five laws have been challenged by coalitions of civil rights and immigrant rights groups, and the federal government has sued to block those in Alabama, South Carolina and Utah.\par \par \uc2 "I do think other states are watching this closely," said Omar Jadwat, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who's set to argue before the 11th Circuit Thursday. "Realistically, I think it's going to be a combination of what happens in this case and what happens in the Supreme Court case that folks in other states are going to look at. If anti-immigrant legislators in other states think that this is a path that is open to them, they'll try to get their states to go down the same path."\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the measures argue such laws lead to discrimination and racial profiling and that immigration is a federal issue that shouldn't be governed by a patchwork of state laws. Supporters say states have been forced to act to protect their resources because the federal government hasn't done enough to quell the influx of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge in June temporarily blocked parts of Georgia's law pending the outcome of the legal challenge filed by the activist groups. One blocked section would authorize police to check the immigration status of suspects who don't have proper identification. The other would create a state penalty for people who knowingly and willingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants while committing another crime.\par \par \uc2 Georgia appealed that decision to the 11th Circuit, which means the court will be deciding whether the injunction can remain in place.\par \par \uc2 After a federal judge in Alabama declined in September to block many provisions of that state's law, the 11th Circuit in October temporarily blocked some parts, including a requirement for schools to check students' immigration status. But the appeals court left intact a section that allows police to check a person's immigration status during a traffic stop and to detain someone they believe is in the country illegally. Courts also can't enforce contracts involving illegal immigrants, such as leases, and it's a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state for basic things such as getting a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 The 11th Circuit will now decide whether to block sections of the law that had been allowed to go into effect, and whether to leave the injunctions previously obtained on other sections in place.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City, Okla., and Laura Wides-Munoz in Miami contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120229e82t001b4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Efforts to step up enforcement against illegal immigrants moved forward Friday in the Mississippi House with a bill modeled on Alabama's crackdown, though its sponsor says his bill doesn't include the parts that have been tied up in federal court challenges.\par \par \uc2 The House Judiciary B Committee voted 15-6 to pass House Bill 488, which now goes to the House Education Committee. It would then go to the full chamber.\par \par \uc2 The bill's sponsor, Judiciary B Committee Chairman Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, said the Mississippi bill should stand up to legal scrutiny. Alabama's law is considered one of the toughest state laws against illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Mississippi has a relatively small \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population, although it appears to have grown in recent years. The Pew Hispanic Center estimated that in 2010, the state had about 45,000 illegal immigrants out of nearly 3 million total residents.\par \par \uc2 The bill is supported by Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican who has been campaigning against illegal immigration since his days as state auditor. Proponents say the state spends more money providing services to immigrants than it reaps in taxes, and claim that illegal immigrants, if they leave, will vacate jobs that unemployed citizens can take. They say the bill is about legal compliance and that they welcome legal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "I believe that every person in Mississippi, whether they are here illegally or not, is a child of God," Gipson said. "We're not trying to hurt anyone. We're not trying to starve anyone."\par \par \uc2 Opponents dispute those claims, emphasizing that Mississippi doesn't need to summon any ghosts of its racist past.\par \par \uc2 "It is still about ethnic cleansing," said Bill Chandler, executive director of the Mississippi Immigrant Rights Alliance. "It is still talking about driving people out of Mississippi."\par \par \uc2 The new version of the bill removed an attempt to create a new crime of failing to carry immigration papers. That provision had led some opponents to nickname the measure the "papers, please" bill. Under the change, a police officer could only check someone's immigration status if the officer had pulled the person over for some other reason.\par \par \uc2 "The reason it was removed is not because it's a bad idea, necessarily," Gipson said. "The reason it has been removed is it has been enjoined by a federal court in Alabama."\par \par \uc2 The bill still says law enforcement officials should check for immigration status when "a reasonable suspicion exists" that a person is in the country illegally. The measure bars police from considering race, color or national origin when making that decision, although opponents still fear racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 The new version also adds an exception if a person is "an international business executive of an international corporation authorized to transact business in the state." In the months after the Alabama law was enacted, police there arrested a Japanese man on assignment at the state's Honda factory and a German man who worked for the state's Mercedes-Benz plant, spurring widespread concern that the law would scare off foreign investors.\par \par \uc2 Another provision was watered down that allows any Mississippi resident to sue a state agency, city or county that looks the other way on immigration status. The bill now says that an agency or government must adopt a written policy or ordinance to be subject to a lawsuit. The measure is supposed to prohibit "sanctuary cities" that don't enforce immigration laws. Gipson indicated that Jackson is a sanctuary city, but it's unclear if a 2010 ordinance that instructed police officers not to use racial profiling or ask about immigration status goes that far.\par \par \uc2 Added was a provision that allows churches and charities to meet "immediate basic and human needs" as long as they doesn't charge or use government funds.\par \par \uc2 Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, tried to also exempt government health care facilities and government-owned utilities from provisions that say illegal immigrants can't enter into business transactions with any state agency or local government. Baria said after the committee meeting that he is worried about the public health consequences of illegal immigrants and their children not being vaccinated or being able to connect water and sewer services.\par \par \uc2 "I want to make sure the children of illegal aliens are not deprived of those necessities of life," Baria said. "Are we going to deny that child a vaccination or other medicines that might keep that child from infecting your child?"\par \par \uc2 Under federal law, emergency rooms would have to continue to treat everyone and public schools would have to continue to enroll illegal immigrants. But the bill still calls for schools to require a birth certificate and follow up on immigration status of anyone who can't produce one. However, the new version simplifies reporting, saying only that districts must submit to the state a yearly count of illegal immigrants in each school.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120224e82o001nt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc99}{\*\bkmkend toc99}\b \uc2 Illinois list of possible Medicaid cuts includes 9 percent rate cut for doctors, hospitals\b0\par\par\uc2 By CARLA K. JOHNSON   \par \uc2 AP Medical Writer\par \uc2 1,023 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 February 2012\par 20:45\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - It's a tricky math problem to get to the $2.7 billion that Gov. Pat Quinn wants cut out of Illinois's projected Medicaid spending, and four lawmakers designated to take a first shot at it will have a tough time figuring out what to subtract.\par \par \uc2 They'll look at services such as the obesity surgery that helped 41-year-old Cicero resident Nova Taggart get off diabetes drugs. They'll look at payments to hospitals that are already struggling. Should people on Medicaid be able to get two pairs of eyeglasses each year? Or one pair every other year? Should poor adults get their dental care covered?\par \par \uc2 A menu of possible cuts prepared by Quinn's administration includes few dollar figures and those numbers don't add up to $2.7 billion. That's because specific dollar amounts for various options are still being calculated for the bipartisan legislative working group, Quinn senior health adviser Michael Gelder said Thursday, a day after the governor said Medicaid "is on the brink of collapse" in his budget address.\par \par \uc2 But what's clear, Gelder said, is that lawmakers will have to choose everything on the list of possible Medicaid cuts to get to the $2.7 billion proposed by Quinn. For example, all the listed options short of cutting payments to hospitals, doctors and pharmacies add up to only $1.9 billion, he said. Rate cuts to providers are needed to reach the target.\par \par \uc2 The amount the state needs to cut "is overwhelming. It's awe-inspiring," Gelder said. "I'd say `inconceivable,' but we have to begin to conceive this. It's of Herculean proportion."\par \par \uc2 The list is not a proposal from the governor's office or from the Department of Healthcare and Family Services, which prepared it. "The menu of possible options does not reflect the administration's proposal; it will require bipartisan cooperation for final decision," the document dated Feb. 22 states.\par \par \uc2 The list includes some items that probably seem reasonable to people covered by private insurance plans: Limiting the number of eyeglasses paid for each year, for example, or eliminating coverage of chiropractors. The current Medicaid program has no annual limit on eyeglasses or chiropractors.\par \par \uc2 The menu includes limiting -- or eliminating entirely -- dental care for adults and "durable medical goods" such as walkers and wheelchairs. It includes axing smaller programs for sexual assault victims, people with hemophilia and refugees who've been victims of torture. Obesity surgery is on the list for limits or elimination.\par \par \uc2 Taggart, 41, of Cicero, had obesity surgery Jan. 11 at University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. The state-federal Medicaid program paid for it. Taggart paid only copayments of $2 to $5 each time she saw her doctor. She said she would have willingly paid more if she could do so over time. The surgery has eliminated her need for diabetes medication and she's lost about 15 pounds so far from her top weight of 221 pounds. She is 5-foot-2.\par \par \uc2 "I hope they don't cut it," Taggart said. "I was grateful I was given the opportunity."\par \par \uc2 The list also include more drastic cuts, such as changing eligibility rules for nursing homes and at-home help so that some incontinent elderly people who can't prepare their own meals would be denied state-financed care.\par \par \uc2 Today it works like this: Elderly and disabled adults are evaluated before they receive Medicaid-paid services such as help with bathing or cooking. They are evaluated using a "determination of need" score.\par \par \uc2 Increasing the cutoff score, as proposed, would mean people such as a 65-year-old incontinent woman with cataracts and arthritis who needs help with cooking and taking medications would no longer qualify for Medicaid help at home, said Carol Aronson of Shawnee Alliance in Carterville, which does such evaluations for the state.\par \par \uc2 "These are not people who can care for themselves," Aronson said. "The conditions in those homes are going to be atrocious. It is going to be heart-breaking."\par \par \uc2 Also on the menu is excluding \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children from the All Kids program. Gelder said the Quinn administration didn't want to put dollar figures on items that could become politically charged during debate.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody's going to have a political ax to grind about torture victims, but they might about undocumented children," Gelder said.\par \par \uc2 Gelder said even with the listed cuts, there would remain a nearly $2 billion backlog in overdue Medicaid payments.\par \par \uc2 The list states that a 9 percent reduction in payments to hospitals, doctors and pharmacies would reduce state and federal Medicaid spending by $825 million next year. A 6 percent rate cut would reduce spending by $550 million, according to the list.\par \par \uc2 Hospitals in poor neighborhoods would be especially hard hit by Medicaid cuts, said leaders of seven Chicago safety-net hospitals.\par \par \uc2 Mark Newton, president and CEO at Swedish Covenant Hospital on Chicago's northwest side, said his facility is already operating at a $1 million loss and the state of Illinois owes the hospital nearly $10 million.\par \par \uc2 With cuts to Medicaid payment rates to hospitals, the hospital would have to cut back services and reduce staff, Newton said. About 22 percent of the hospital's admissions are Medicaid patients.\par \par \uc2 "This is just going to accelerate the decline to care for our vulnerable populations," Newton said. "I'm extremely worried about it."\par \par \uc2 The working group assigned to sorting out the Medicaid cuts consists of two Democrats -- Sen. Heather Steans and Rep. Sara Feigenholtz -- and two Republicans -- Sen. Dale Righter and Rep. Patti Bellock.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether it was possible to cut $2.7 billion, Bellock, R-Hinsdale, said: "It's going to have to be. If it's not, it's going to be $5.4 (billion) next year. The state is drowning in debt."\par \par \uc2 Chicago Democrat Feigenholtz agreed that $2.7 billion in cuts is possible. "We're sure going try," she said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Shannon McFarland contributed to this report from Springfield.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document
