The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Jury selection began Monday in the murder trial of a man accused of killing federal intern Chandra Levy nearly a decade ago, a case that derailed a California congressman's career and generated headlines around the world.\par \par \uc2 Ingmar Guandique, 29, is charged with murder, kidnapping, attempted sexual assault and other counts. Authorities say he attacked Levy while she was jogging alone in Rock Creek Park in May 2001.\par \par \uc2 Levy's disappearance -- her body was not discovered until more than a year after she went missing -- caused a national sensation when she was romantically linked to then-Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif. Authorities once considered Condit a prime suspect but no longer believe he had anything to do with her death.\par \par \uc2 Levy, 24, had just completed an internship with the U.S. Bureau of Prisons when she disappeared. When Guandique was charged last year with killing her, the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador had been serving a 10-year sentence for separate assaults in Rock Creek Park.\par \par \uc2 In court Monday, jurors filled out an 11-page questionnaire that sought to determine their exposure to pretrial publicity and whether they can sit as jurors on a case that could stretch six weeks. Their answers to the questions about their exposure to the case were not disclosed.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys objected that the first half of the 114-member jury pool were subjected to individual security screenings with handheld metal detectors before they entered the courtroom, arguing that the enhanced security measures implied to jurors that Guandique is a threat. Superior Court Judge Gerald Fisher agreed to stop subjecting the jurors to the enhanced screening, but rejected a request from the defense to have all 56 of those jurors dismissed from the pool.\par \par \uc2 After one day of jury selection, 33 members of 114-person pool were struck, almost all because they had travel or some other personal or professional hardship. Concerns over exposure to pretrial publicity will be dealt with on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The federal public defenders who represent Guandique hired a jury consultant to help them decide which jurors they should seek to keep on the case and which they should seek to strike.\par \par \uc2 Guandique appeared in court Monday before a pool of potential jurors in a beige blazer and a cream-colored turtleneck that covered a series of gang tattoos. He introduced himself to jurors in Spanish, using the phrase "Buenos dias."\par \par \uc2 Before the trial formally began on Monday, defense attorney Santha Sonenberg complained to the judge that the government had been negligent in turning over a potentially important piece of evidence.\par \par \uc2 Sonenberg said the defense learned only on Sunday that authorities had tried to match fingerprints from a crime scene not only to Guandique but also to another man. Sonenberg said the defense had heard of the other man and had no information on whether police may have at one time considered him a suspect.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors responded that they thought they had disclosed the man's name to the defense.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear what role Condit will play in the trial. A spokesman for Condit says the former congressman expects to be called as a witness, though he has not been subpoenaed.\par \par \uc2 Jury selection is expected to take most of the week, and opening statements might not begin until next Monday.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101018e6ai001vz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc2}{\*\bkmkend toc2}\b \uc2 After 9 years and congressman's fall, relative unknown goes to trial in Chandra Levy's killing\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATTHEW BARAKAT   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 787 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 October 2010\par 11:56\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - If one person is associated with the mysterious slaying of Washington intern Chandra Levy, it isn't the man who will soon be tried on charges he murdered her. It's former California congressman Gary Condit, whose political career imploded after he was romantically linked to the woman and became the No. 1 suspect.\par \par \uc2 Ingmar Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, goes on trial Monday for Levy's 2001 killing. However, he's not even a blip on the national consciousness of the case, which dominated news coverage until the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks rendered it an afterthought.\par \par \uc2 While police no longer believe Condit had anything to do with Levy's death, his presence will continue to hang over the trial. Condit's spokesman, Bert Fields, said Condit expects to be called as a witness at Guandique's trial, though he has not been subpoenaed.\par \par \uc2 Fields said Condit will cooperate fully with authorities. But the ex-congressman, who is writing a book about his experience, will not comment on the trial until it ends.\par \par \uc2 Bill Miller, a spokesman for the prosecutors' office, declined comment on the case and whether Condit will be called as a witness, citing a gag order issued earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys are also subject to the gag order. But when Guandique was charged in 2009 with Levy's murder, they criticized what they saw as a botched investigation. Guandique escaped scrutiny in large part because of the frenzy around Condit. The former congressman never admitted an affair but said he was friends with Levy, though the intern had told family members the two had a romantic relationship.\par \par \uc2 "This flawed investigation, characterized by the many mistakes and missteps of the Metropolitan Police Department and every federal agency that has attempted to solve this case, will not end with the simple issuance of an arrest warrant against Mr. Guandique," said the attorneys, Santha Sonenberg and Maria Hawilo.\par \par \uc2 At a pretrial hearing Thursday, Sonenberg said police were so desperate to get a confession from Guandique to bolster their case that in 2004 and 2005, police tried to establish a phony penpal relationship with Guandique while he was in prison serving a 10-year sentence, using the pseudonym "Maria Lopez." The ruse did not work.\par \par \uc2 "It goes to the sort of antics, the sort of shenanigans, the lengths to which they've gone to prosecute Mr. Guandique," Sonenberg said.\par \par \uc2 Then-U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Taylor has acknowledged the case lacked DNA or physical evidence linking Guandique to Levy. And Guandique never confessed to police -- in fact, he passed a lie-detector test denying involvement in Levy's disappearance, though prosecutors now question the validity of that test.\par \par \uc2 But Taylor cited significant circumstantial evidence, including numerous confessions that Guandique purportedly made to other inmates. And Levy's body was found in a wooded section of the city's Rock Creek Park, where Guandique was convicted of assaulting two other young women in 2001.\par \par \uc2 At a pretrial hearing last month, Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Haines said Guandique has a "signature confession style." She said he has discussed killing Levy with many people, giving each person starkly different details.\par \par \uc2 Whether jurors believe those confessions will be key. The defense wants to present expert testimony from a university professor on the pitfalls of accounts from jailhouse snitches. However, prosecutors say jurors should be allowed to judge the credibility of witnesses for themselves. Superior Court Judge Gerald I. Fisher has indicated he will not allow the vast majority of the professor's proposed testimony.\par \par \uc2 As for Condit, exactly what role he will play in the trial is unclear. Defense attorneys could be tempted to remind jurors that police were suspicious of Condit for so long, said attorney George Jackson, a Chicago-based lawyer with the Polsinelli Shughart law firm and a former federal prosecutor.\par \par \uc2 Jackson said the defense will have to tread lightly because jurors will be put off if they sense attorneys are trying to make an innocent man into a scapegoat. And the government will surely be ready to counter suggestions that Condit was involved. But because Condit is so closely linked to the case in the public's eye, the defense has some leeway to approach the issue with subtlety.\par \par \uc2 "If it's feasible to suggest that this guy may have been involved, you put it out there" to help create reasonable doubt in a jury's mind, Jackson said. "But it's a dangerous thing to do because you don't know if there will be a backlash."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101017e6ah002nl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Sharron Angle defended a series of campaign advertisements that use images of sullen, dark-skinned men and a map of Mexico to blast rival Sen. Harry Reid's immigration record.\par \par \uc2 Angle, a tea party favorite who has rallied for stricter border enforcement, played down her usual conservative rhetoric in a brief discussion with a Hispanic high school group Friday in Las Vegas. The students asked her to explain her repeated use of TV spots denounced by national pro-immigrant and Hispanic organizations as race-baiting attacks.\par \par \uc2 "I think that you're misinterpreting those commercials," Angle is seen telling the students in a video of the private meeting obtained by The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not sure that those are Latinos in that commercial. What it is, is a fence and there are people coming across that fence. What we know is that our northern border is where the terrorists came through. That's the most porous border that we have. We cannot allow terrorists, we cannot allow anyone to come across our border if we don't know why they're coming. So, we have to secure all of our borders and that's what that was about, is border security."\par \par \uc2 Rancho High School teacher Isaac Barron said his students organized the meeting with Angle Friday because they felt the ads stereotyped young Hispanics. Barron, a Democrat, said Angle's explanation was met with incredulous stares.\par \par \uc2 "Some of the kids, they couldn't help but chuckle at that," he said. "To deny they are anti-Hispanic when those are the only people shown in her ads, it doesn't add up."\par \par \uc2 Hispanics are an increasingly important voting bloc in Nevada, where they make up roughly 25 percent of the population. More than 80 percent of the Silver State's Hispanics hail from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Reid has tried to brand Angle as "too extreme" in the tight race.\par \par \uc2 The Democrat is counting on the Hispanic vote to secure his fifth term and has also tailored his message on immigration to the crowd he is addressing. To mainstream audiences, he has touted his votes to beef up border security. To Hispanic crowds, he has vowed to make the road to citizenship more inclusive.\par \par \uc2 Angle's campaign has released more than five TV spots that accuse Reid, the Senate majority leader, of offering special breaks to illegal immigrants. The ads have drawn criticism from some immigration advocates worried that such messages encourage discrimination against Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 "Basically she is using the politics of fear and trying to tell Americans that, 'we are being invaded by Mexicans, so vote for me,'" said Lynn Tramonte, director deputy of America's Voice.\par \par \uc2 Angle campaign spokesman Jarrod Agen, who said Reid was "pro-amnesty," would not say why the images were chosen for the ads.\par \par \uc2 "Sharron has said several times before that illegal immigration is not about race, it is about the rule of law in this country," he said in an e-mail.\par \par \uc2 Agen said one of the most criticized images, a still of three stony-faced Hispanic men, was bought from \uc2 Getty Images Inc\uc2 . The Getty caption notes that the image is of Mexican men in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101016e6ag002bu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - The four candidates for Massachusetts governor said Friday they would adopt different strategies to help stem gun violence and street crime in the wake of the shooting of five people last month in Boston.\par \par \uc2 Republican Charles Baker said during the debate at Emerson College that the state should agree to a federal program that would run the names of violent individuals through a national database to check their immigration status, and deport those here illegally.\par \par \uc2 Baker also said that the state should require anyone who enters a courtroom to witness a trial to sign in so authorities can check for outstanding warrants against them. He said that would help discourage the intimidation of witnesses and jurors by gang members.\par \par \uc2 "This is a fight and we need to treat it like a fight," Baker said.\par \par \uc2 Democratic incumbent Deval Patrick said the focus should be on the schools. He said Massachusetts needs to seriously look at lengthening both the school day and the school year as a way to offer young people a positive alternative to gang activity.\par \par \uc2 "We have a calendar that's based on farming. You get out in time to plant. You stay out long enough to harvest," he said. "That's not our economy anymore."\par \par \uc2 Patrick said extending school hours would also give students a chance to be in the company of responsible adults.\par \par \uc2 Independent candidate Timothy Cahill said he would devote state funds to deploy more police and youth workers in neighborhoods with the toughest crime problems. He said he would fight for adequate funding of after-school and dropout prevention programs.\par \par \uc2 Cahill said parents and other responsible adults must play a role, as do jobs for inner-city youth.\par \par \uc2 "I could have gone a couple of different ways where I grew up, but my parents were really on top of me to make sure I stayed in school," Cahill said.\par \par \uc2 Green-Rainbow candidate Jill Stein said the state's high-stakes Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System test is one reason students drop out of school and get involved with gangs and other illegal activity.\par \par \uc2 The comments come weeks after the Sept. 28 shooting of five people in the city's Mattapan neighborhood. Four died, including a 2-year-old boy. A Boston man has been charged in connection with the shooting and ordered held on $500,000 bail.\par \par \uc2 During the debate, Cahill was asked about Attorney General Martha Coakley's request that the state lottery, which Cahill oversees as state treasurer, stop running ads until after the Nov. 2 election. Coakley's office is investigating allegations of improper coordination between lottery staffers and Cahill's campaign on the timing of lottery advertisements.\par \par \uc2 "We're cooperating," Cahill said.\par \par \uc2 At the end of the debate, which also touched on alternative energy, in-state tuition for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students and the state's struggling economy, the four were asked which living politician they would most like to be.\par \par \uc2 Cahill named the first President Bush, saying he was able to work across party lines for the good of the country even at the cost of a second term, while Patrick named New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, saying he stood up for the principle of religious freedom during the controversy surrounding the proposed Islamic community center and mosque near the World Trade Center site.\par \par \uc2 Baker named former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, saying he showed grit and determination in reviving that city at a time when critics said it was ungovernable. Stein chose Mel King, a longtime community organizer in Boston who came close to being elected the city's first black mayor in 1983.\par \par \uc2 The debate was sponsored by the Boston Herald, Emerson College and WFXT-TV.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101015e6af0020z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Democrat John Hickenlooper routinely refers to his executive experience as mayor and restaurateur in his run for governor.\par \par \uc2 "Whether you're running a city or a restaurant, there are three things always the same: You never have enough money, you've got a diverse group of people you have to make into a great team, and the public is always ticked off about something," he said in an interview with The Associated Press. "The real truth is while running a small business, a restaurant, you learn there is no margin in having enemies."\par \par \uc2 Denver's mayor hopes his eagerness to collaborate across the aisle -- on the state budget, on energy development, on immigration -- will make him Colorado's next governor.\par \par \uc2 As mayor, he cut Denver's work force by 7 percent through attrition and by consolidating department computer divisions. He promises to do the same for the state as a start.\par \par \uc2 His main opponent, American Constitution Party candidate Tom Tancredo, argues Hickenlooper can't collaborate his way out of the state's budget crisis and would have to make tough choices -- starting with the state payroll.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo and GOP candidate Dan Maes pledge to revoke an order by Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter that allowed state workers to organize. Hickenlooper says he'll let the order stand because he'd need union cooperation to balance the budget.\par \par \uc2 The Colorado WINS union says it now represents about 3,000 of the state's 30,000 eligible workers.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper, 58, has moved away from Ritter, who is leaving office after one term. Unlike Ritter, he says, he would invite opponents at the outset to negotiate any legislation affecting divisive issues such as college funding and Colorado's oil and gas industry.\par \par \uc2 "Ritter asked people to bring him the final facts and he was the prosecutor and he would make the decision," Hickenlooper said. "Our biggest difference is that we aren't that way. We try to make sure everybody's in the room at the same time from the very beginning."\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper brushed aside Tancredo's claims that he runs a "sanctuary city" for illegal immigrants. Denver police, Hickenlooper said, have referred 7,300 suspected illegal immigrants to federal immigration officials since 2006.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper also said Colorado doesn't need an immigration law like the one in Arizona that requires police to check immigration status, and he vowed to veto any legislation like it.\par \par \uc2 "Most of us agree on the basics," he said. "We need to secure the border. We need to have a national identification of some sort that works, that can't be easily forged, that is unique and protected. We need to have a system where we can hold business accountable (for hiring illegal immigrants) and we need to have some appropriate number of guest workers.\par \par \uc2 "The rest of it is all compromises."\par \par \uc2 During debates this summer, Tancredo brought up the 2005 shooting death of Denver police detective Donald Young by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who worked in a restaurant owned by Hickenlooper.\par \par \uc2 Raul Gomez-Garcia was convicted of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder for wounding Officer Jack Bishop. He was sentenced to 80 years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper said the restaurant was in trust because he is mayor and that he had no control over hiring. "He presented forged legal documents and he committed a truly hideous crime," Hickenlooper said.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper also disputed Republicans' claims that he and partners had a sweetheart deal to sell conservation easements on property they owned in Park County. He said he paid $52,486 to the Internal Revenue Service in 2008 after it denied some claims for tax credits on the easements. It would have been too expensive to otherwise contest IRS claims that the land was overvalued, he said.\par \par \uc2 Tax records show Hickenlooper received more than $1.1 million in federal tax write-offs on the land before the IRS asked for part of the money back.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101015e6af001xi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Democratic U.S. Rep. Walt Minnick called for bipartisan solutions to cure the nation's economic woes even as he and his Republican challenger, Raul Labrador, traded sharp barbs during a debate Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Minnick and Labrador all but bickered over negative ads each side has launched against the other for the first half of their only televised debate before the Nov. 2 election.\par \par \uc2 Labrador, an attorney and two-term state lawmaker from Eagle, called Minnick "shameful" for airing negative ads that attacked Labrador's work in immigration law and told voters he profited from illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Labrador joked that the ads appear to portray him as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I've seen some pretty vile rhetoric," Labrador said, "and I think he should be ashamed of that."\par \par \uc2 Minnick then blasted Labrador for his new campaign ad, which targets Minnick's voting record and support for a pair of bills passed this summer that spent $68 billion to preserve teaching jobs and open credit to small businesses.\par \par \uc2 While the bills had support from some Republicans and are not designed to be paid for by adding to the federal deficit, Labrador's ad characterizes both pieces of legislation as "stimulus spending" and flashes pictures of Minnick alongside pictures of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Barack Obama.\par \par \uc2 "To say that I'm a Nancy Pelosi clone and that I voted with the bailouts, you know that's not true," said Minnick, a fiscal conservative who represents Idaho's 1st Congressional District.\par \par \uc2 Independent candidate Dave Olson chastised Minnick and Labrador for not talking enough about the issues and what they would do to limit the federal government's reach.\par \par \uc2 The debate, which aired statewide on Idaho Public Television, was marked with heated exchanges between Minnick and Labrador over illegal immigration. But there seemed to be little difference in their stances on the issue.\par \par \uc2 Minnick said the nation needs to secure its borders, ensure employers hire legal workers and implement a temporary worker program. He also proposed a system where illegal immigrants would come out of hiding and go before a judge, who would determine a penalty whether it be jail or deportation, and then provide them an avenue toward legal status.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Labrador called for the enforcement of existing immigration laws, a secure the border even if it means deploying the national guard to do so, and the implementation of a guest worker program. In the Idaho Legislature, he co-sponsored a bill that sought to punish businesses caught knowingly hiring illegal workers. The measure failed.\par \par \uc2 The issue has become a centerpiece of the race for the 1st District, which encompasses the western half of Idaho and spans from the state board with Nevada north to the state border with Canada.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, Minnick upset GOP U.S. Rep. Bill Sali to score Idaho's biggest political upset in more than a decade claim the seat that had long been in Republican hands. A fiscal conservative, Minnick voted against the health care overhaul bill and the bailouts, touting his record as the "most independent" member of the U.S. House.\par \par \uc2 Minnick has raised more than $2.4 million in his bid for a second term.\par \par \uc2 Labrador's campaign has countered that Minnick is going to have to spend every penny in his campaign war chest to save his political livelihood amid widespread voter frustration with Washington and his party's leadership.\par \par \uc2 During the last half of the debate, which was also sponsored by the Idaho Press Club and the League of Women Voters, Minnick drew sharp contrasts between him and his opponent. He painted Labrador as an extremist who supports a return to the gold standard and repeal of the 17th Amendment requiring direct elections of U.S. senators.\par \par \uc2 "Whether it's a Republican or Democratic Congress, it will be the centrist like myself who has the greatest influence," Minnick said.\par \par \uc2 Labrador agreed the difference between the two men couldn't be more stark.\par \par \uc2 "If you are happy with what has happened over the past two years in the United States, than I am not your choice," Labrador said. "But if you want somebody who will go back to Washington, D.C. and will actually stand up to Obama and will actually take on his agenda then you need to elect a proven conservative leader."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101015e6af000fn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) - More than a year after their acquittal on state charges, two Pennsylvania men were convicted of a federal hate crime and could be sentenced to life in prison for beating and kicking a Mexican immigrant who died of his injuries.\par \par \uc2 The family of 25-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Luis Ramirez applauded the verdict Thursday as a belated measure of justice, while defense attorneys criticized the government's pursuit of charges in a case already once decided and promised an appeal.\par \par \uc2 An all-white jury found that Derrick Donchak and Brandon Piekarsky, former high school football players in the small town of Shenandoah, violated Ramirez's civil rights when they assaulted him on July 12, 2008. The jury also convicted Donchak of two other counts related to a plot to cover up the beating.\par \par \uc2 Crystal Dillman, who had two children with Ramirez, told The Associated Press she "couldn't be happier."\par \par \uc2 "My family finally gets justice, well, some justice and Luis can finally rest a little bit easier in peace knowing that some justice was served," Dillman said. "It's like a burden's lifted off my chest to know that something was done for Luis."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors alleged that Donchak, Piekarsky and two other white teens beat and kicked Ramirez because they didn't like Hispanics and wanted them out of their town.\par \par \uc2 "They showed no remorse that night ... no sense of responsibility for having beaten a man to the point of death," Justice Department prosecutor Myesha Braden told jurors Wednesday in her closing argument.\par \par \uc2 The defense said the melee stemmed from youthful aggression, not ethnic hatred, and cast Ramirez as a hothead more than willing to fight.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys William Fetterhoff and James Swetz called the verdict disappointing.\par \par \uc2 Thomas E. Perez, chief of the Justice Department's civil rights division, said the jury demonstrated that "violence committed because of a victim's race, national origin or ethnicity will not be tolerated."\par \par \uc2 Witnesses gave conflicting, and at times confusing, accounts of the late-night brawl that pitted Ramirez -- a short, stout man nicknamed "Caballo," Spanish for horse -- against four drunken teenagers during a random encounter on the street.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed that youth, testosterone and alcohol played a role. But they argued over the mindset of a quartet of belligerent teens who called Ramirez a "spic," told him to go back to Mexico and assaulted the immigrant with their fists and feet.\par \par \uc2 Federal charges were brought against Piekarsky and Donchak after another all-white jury acquitted them of serious state crimes, including third-degree murder in Piekarsky's case. Hispanic activists decried the May 2009 verdict, calling Ramirez's death part of a rising tide of hate crimes against Latinos. They and Gov. Ed Rendell appealed for a Justice Department prosecution.\par \par \uc2 Fetterhoff complained Thursday about the second prosecution.\par \par \uc2 "It is a surprising verdict, in view of the first verdict in Schuylkill County Court," said Fetterhoff, Donchak's attorney. "This is exactly the problem when defendants are subject to being tried twice on the same facts."\par \par \uc2 Piekarsky was accused of delivering a fatal kick to Ramirez's head after he'd been knocked unconscious by another teen, Colin Walsh, who pleaded guilty in federal court and testified against his childhood friends last week. A fourth teen, Brian Scully, pleaded guilty in juvenile court and also testified for the prosecution.\par \par \uc2 After the fight, the teens met and hatched a plan in which they would falsely tell police that no one was drunk, did any kicking or used any racial slurs.\par \par \uc2 Both defendants were convicted of a hate crime under the Fair Housing Act. Donchak also was convicted of two counts that he conspired with Shenandoah police to cover up the crime. The accused officers are scheduled to go on trial early next year.\par \par \uc2 Donchak, 20, sobbed as the verdict was read. Piekarsky, 18, put his head in his hands. Both were led away in handcuffs and ordered held behind bars pending their sentencing on Jan. 24.\par \par \uc2 The trial cast an unflattering light on Shenandoah, a hardscrabble town about 80 miles northwest of Philadelphia. Witnesses described a racially tense atmosphere as Hispanics swelled the population, attracted by cheap housing and jobs in factories and farm fields.\par \par \uc2 "Shenandoah was a tough town in 1880," Fetterhoff said, describing a boom period when coal mining attracted hordes of uneducated European immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "It was a tough town in 1950. And it was a tough town in 2008," he told jurors. "For better or worse."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101015e6af00075\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Three immigrants in Georgia are suing to challenge a government program that allows local authorities to enforce federal immigration law, and they are seeking to have the case declared a class action to represent many other immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Experts say the lawsuit, filed last week in federal court in Atlanta, could be the first to directly challenge the legitimacy of the 287(g) program, which has been used to identify more than 180,000 illegal immigrants for deportation nationwide since 2006.\par \par \uc2 "I have heard of nobody filing a lawsuit on this, and I would have heard about it," said Charles Kuck, a prominent Atlanta immigration lawyer and past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit names U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director John Morton, Cobb County Sheriff Neil Warren, an investigator for the Georgia Department of Public Safety and other officials as defendants.\par \par \uc2 A Department of Public Safety spokesman and a spokeswoman for Warren's office said Thursday their agencies hadn't seen the lawsuit and couldn't comment. An ICE spokesman said the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit seeks to define the class as "all Hispanic persons who have been or will be restrained and interrogated within the State of Georgia" by local authorities enforcing federal immigration law under an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 As of late September, the 287(g) program had been used to identify 14,692 illegal immigrants in Georgia for deportation in the four years since Cobb became the first county in the state to launch the program, according to ICE. Three additional counties plus the state Department of Public Safety have since signed agreements.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit alleges ICE has failed to train, supervise and otherwise oversee sheriff's deputies in Cobb County, where the three plaintiffs live. It also claims ICE has improperly delegated its power to local authorities.\par \par \uc2 "This is a bad thing, and it tears apart families," said attorney Erik Meder, who filed the lawsuit. "While these people are certainly in the country illegally, they aren't criminals and don't deserve to be locked up and separated from their families."\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials have broad discretionary power and should not be issuing a notice to appear -- which initiates deportation proceedings -- for illegal immigrants who are arrested and discovered to be in the country illegally after initially having been stopped for relatively minor offenses, the lawsuit says.\par \par \uc2 The program is part of the 1996 Immigration and Nationality Act, but wasn't used much until 2006. It is intended to train state and local officers in immigration law enforcement and enables them to identify and detain illegal immigrants, who can then be turned over to ICE.\par \par \uc2 It has become a rallying point for immigrant rights activists all over the country who say it encourages racial profiling and discourages Latinos from reporting crimes for fear of being deported.\par \par \uc2 The inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, reported in March that the 287(g) program was poorly supervised and provided insufficient training to officers. The inspector general made recommendations for overhauling the program.\par \par \uc2 It was the second critical report for the program. The Government Accountability Office had criticized it in July 2009.\par \par \uc2 Meder said the program is unconstitutional because it "impermissibly delegates federal power to local authorities with insufficient oversight."\par \par \uc2 Kuck doesn't support the 287(g) program but said he believes Congress specifically authorized ICE to delegate enforcement authority to local entities.\par \par \uc2 "Unfortunately, I don't think it's unconstitutional," he said. "I don't think there's any harm in challenging it, but I don't expect the suit to go anywhere. And I certainly don't think it will be given class-action status."\par \par \uc2 Brittney Nystrom of the National Immigration Forum, a Washington-based immigrant advocacy organization, said she hasn't heard of any other lawsuit that directly attacks 287(g) on its merits.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the advocacy around this program is that local authorities aren't using the authority they're given correctly, that there's racial profiling, for example," she said.\par \par \uc2 The three named plaintiffs in the lawsuit "each represent a different kind of abuse" of the program, Meder said.\par \par \uc2 One, a Mexican citizen who came to the U.S. legally in 2004 but overstayed her authorization, was arrested after a car crash for not having a driver's license and is being deported.\par \par \uc2 The second, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  arrested on a shoplifting charge that she is fighting, is in deportation proceedings. But the lawsuit argues she should be able to stay until her criminal case is decided.\par \par \uc2 The third is an El Salvadoran immigrant who has legal authorization to work in the U.S. but was arrested in July on felony forgery charges. Authorities say he used a false immigration document to renew his driver's license, a charge he denies.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101015e6af0002r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A potential class-action lawsuit has been filed in federal court in Atlanta over a government program that allows local authorities to enforce federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Experts say the lawsuit, filed last week on behalf of three immigrants in Georgia, could be the first to directly challenge the legitimacy of the 287(g) program, which has been used to identify more than 180,000 illegal immigrants for deportation nationwide since 2006.\par \par \uc2 "I have heard of nobody filing a lawsuit on this, and I would have heard about it," said Charles Kuck, a prominent Atlanta immigration lawyer and past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit names U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director John Morton, Cobb County Sheriff Neil Warren, an investigator for the Georgia Department of Public Safety and other officials as defendants.\par \par \uc2 A Department of Public Safety spokesman and a spokeswoman for Warren's office said Thursday their agencies hadn't seen the lawsuit and couldn't comment. ICE did not have an immediate comment.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit was filed on behalf of three immigrants and seeks to define the class as "all Hispanic persons who have been or will be restrained and interrogated within the State of Georgia" by local authorities enforcing federal immigration law under an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 As of late September, the 287(g) program had been used to identify 14,692 illegal immigrants in Georgia for deportation in the four years since Cobb became the first county in the state to launch the program, according to ICE. Three additional counties plus the state Department of Public Safety have since signed agreements.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit alleges ICE has failed to train, supervise and otherwise oversee sheriff's deputies in Cobb County, where the three plaintiffs live. It also claims ICE has improperly delegated its power to local authorities.\par \par \uc2 "This is a bad thing, and it tears apart families," said attorney Erik Meder, who filed the lawsuit. "While these people are certainly in the country illegally, they aren't criminals and don't deserve to be locked up and separated from their families."\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials have broad discretionary power and should not be issuing a notice to appear -- which initiates deportation proceedings -- for illegal immigrants who are arrested and discovered to be in the country illegally after initially having been stopped for relatively minor offenses, the lawsuit says.\par \par \uc2 The program is part of the 1996 Immigration and Nationality Act, but wasn't used much until 2006. It is intended to train state and local officers in immigration law enforcement and enables them to identify and detain illegal immigrants, who can then be turned over to ICE.\par \par \uc2 It has become a rallying point for immigrant rights activists all over the country who say it encourages racial profiling and discourages Latinos from reporting crimes for fear of being deported.\par \par \uc2 The inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, reported in March that the 287(g) program was poorly supervised and provided insufficient training to officers. The inspector general made recommendations for overhauling the program.\par \par \uc2 It was the second critical report for the program. The Government Accountability Office had criticized it in July 2009.\par \par \uc2 Meder said the program is unconstitutional because it "impermissibly delegates federal power to local authorities with insufficient oversight."\par \par \uc2 Kuck doesn't support the 287(g) program but said he believes Congress specifically authorized ICE to delegate enforcement authority to local entities.\par \par \uc2 "Unfortunately, I don't think it's unconstitutional," he said. "I don't think there's any harm in challenging it, but I don't expect the suit to go anywhere. And I certainly don't think it will be given class-action status."\par \par \uc2 Brittney Nystrom of the National Immigration Forum, a Washington-based immigrant advocacy organization, said she hasn't heard of any other lawsuit that directly attacks 287(g) on its merits.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the advocacy around this program is that local authorities aren't using the authority they're given correctly, that there's racial profiling, for example," she said.\par \par \uc2 The three named plaintiffs in the lawsuit "each represent a different kind of abuse" of the program, Meder said.\par \par \uc2 One, a Mexican citizen who came to the U.S. legally in 2004 but overstayed her authorization, was arrested after a car crash for not having a driver's license and is being deported. The second, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  arrested on a shoplifting charge she is fighting, is in deportation proceedings. But the lawsuit argues she should be able to stay until her criminal case is decided. The third is an El Salvadoran immigrant who has legal authorization to work in the U.S. but was arrested in July on felony forgery charges. Authorities say he used a false immigration document to renew his driver's license, a charge he denies.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101014e6ae002gw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Voting rights activists said tea partiers' efforts to obtain voter registration records could have a chilling effect on turnout, potentially undercutting Democrats and swaying the outcome of the Nov. 2 elections.\par \par \uc2 Activists on Wednesday noted that dozens of tea party-aligned groups have sought records and are planning to visit polling places on Election Day to enforce their own "voter protection" programs.\par \par \uc2 "No one wants voter fraud, but unfounded fears cannot serve as prevention of actual voters casting actual votes," said Michael Waldman, the executive director of the Brennan Center for Justice.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 EDITOR'S NOTE -- An insider's view of this year's elections based on reports from around the nation.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 And with anger at Washington at a fever pitch and an anti-incumbent sentiment growing, the loosely organized tea party's efforts to challenge voters on Election Day could dissuade scores of voters from casting ballots, the activists said. Tea party groups from California to Florida have organized to go to polling locations to check registrations themselves.\par \par \uc2 "We are worried this year that we could see large-scale efforts to challenge voters at the polls," said Wendy Weiser of the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan public policy and law institute based at New York University.\par \par \uc2 Gloria Montano Greene of the National Association of Latino Elected Officials also cautioned that the persistent anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  fervor could drive down turnout or unfairly target those who appear to be immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Black voters, too, are likely to face challengers, activists warned.\par \par \uc2 "We know that we continue to face stark levels of voting discrimination around the country," said Kristen Clarke, co-director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund's voter project.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Chef and television personality Nathalie Dupree has become the sixth hopeful to enter the race for the Senate seat from South Carolina served by Jim DeMint.\par \par \uc2 Dupree, who has written 10 cookbooks and whose hundreds of cooking shows have been telecast nationwide, has launched a write-in campaign for the seat.\par \par \uc2 "I got into the race because I had thought someone would be stepping forward to give Jim DeMint enough of a hard time so that he couldn't feel he could just ignore South Carolina," she said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 DeMint has spent time campaigning in other states to help candidates to victory in Republican primaries through his political action committee.\par \par \uc2 "I think he's more interested in being a king-maker and aiming for power toward himself," Dupree said.\par \par \uc2 The incumbent's Democratic opponent is Alvin Greene, the unemployed 33-year-old military veteran who faces an obscenity charge. Greene surprised the Democratic establishment when he won the party nomination in June.\par \par \uc2 Dupree, who calls herself an independent Democrat, said someone needed to strongly challenge DeMint, whose office had no comment on her campaign.\par \par \uc2 "My decision to run against Alvin Greene is a 'bless his heart' decision," she added. "I wish the most of him personally but, bless his heart, he is not doing a good job against Jim DeMint."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 West Virginia Republicans are taking shots at Democratic Senate candidate Joe Manchin over an ad that shows him firing a hunting rifle at a paper target labeled "Cap and Trade Bill."\par \par \uc2 GOP Chairman Mike Stuart issued a statement Wednesday faulting Manchin for failing to wear either the blaze orange clothing required when hunting or eye and ear protection.\par \par \uc2 "Any real hunter knows to not wear tan, brown or white clothing when hunting, because those colors are associated with game species," Stuart said.\par \par \uc2 Manchin wasn't hunting in the "Dead Aim" ad. He was firing at a mounted target.\par \par \uc2 The ad touts his endorsement by the National Rifle Association and clarifies the governor's opposition to proposed federal legislation that would regulate greenhouse gases and potentially hurt West Virginia's coal industry. West Virginia is the nation's second-largest coal producing state.\par \par \uc2 Manchin spokeswoman Lara Ramsburg dismissed the GOP attack as desperate and ridiculous.\par \par \uc2 Manchin's GOP opponent, John Raese, violated a critical safety rule in 2006, she noted, when he was running for the same seat against the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd. He posed for photographs with his finger on the trigger of a rifle.\par \par \uc2 Manchin, in contrast, "is an avid outdoorsman who followed the proper rules as they pertain to general target shooting," Ramsburg said.\par \par \uc2 Guns and hunting are a major part of West Virginia's culture, and both sides are trying to appeal to the common sense of sportsmen with Election Day less than three weeks away and the race tight.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Locked in an unexpectedly tough re-election campaign, Democratic Rep. Tim Walz of Minnesota has been criticized by his Republican rival, state Rep. Randy Demmer, for his support of health care legislation.\par \par \uc2 Walz's latest response: At least I've read it.\par \par \uc2 Walz's campaign on Wednesday seized on comments Demmer made during a debate in Rochester, Minn. Asked directly if he had read the health care law, Demmer replied, "No, I didn't."\par \par \uc2 Walz's spokesman, Sara Severs, says Demmer's response shows that "he puts the national Republican Party over southern Minnesota's interests."\par \par \uc2 Democrats' health care reform legislation has been a top issue in Minnesota's 1st Congressional District. Walz, who voted for the legislation, has stuck by his vote. Demmer has called for the law to be repealed.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Bruce Smith in Charleston, S.C., Vicki Smith in Morgantown, W.Va., and Henry C.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - The state Board of Regents voted Wednesday to tighten policies governing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants to Georgia colleges and universities, acting on complaints that the university system has been swamped by \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 The regents approved the stricter policy over the protests of a coalition of immigrant rights activists urging it be rejected.\par \par \uc2 Under the new policies, to take effect with the fall 2011 semester, University System of Georgia schools will be barred from accepting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants if the school has rejected any academically qualified applicants in the two most recent academic years.\par \par \uc2 That includes five Georgia colleges and universities: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Medical College of Georgia and Georgia College & State University.\par \par \uc2 The regents voted on four recommended new policies at their meeting Wednesday after a committee investigated complaints that Georgia taxpayers were subsidizing the education of undocumented students through in-state tuition and that undocumented students were taking seats from academically qualified Georgians. There was little discussion and little opposition to the recommendations.\par \par \uc2 That committee reported that out of preliminary fall 2010 student enrollment of 310,361 students, 501 are in the country illegally or have incomplete documentation -- or 182 new students and 319 returning students. All are paying out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 Under the new rules, applicants must also state on the application whether they are entitled, if admitted, to pay in-state tuition. Even before the vote, illegal immigrants, even those who reside in Georgia, were not eligible for in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 Each university system institution would have verify the legal presence in the United States of every person who is admitted and applies for in-state tuition, for example by using federal databases.\par \par \uc2 Language will be prominently displayed on applications for admission stating that the applicant understands that any false statement on the application or attached documents could result in a fine of not more than $1,000, a prison sentence of one to five years and dismissal from the school.\par \par \uc2 The board was forced to address the issue of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students in Georgia after a high-profile case involving an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and Kennesaw State University student who was nearly deported after an arrest in March.\par \par \uc2 Jessica Colotl was arrested after a traffic stop for driving without a license. When Cobb County authorities determined she was in the country illegally, they turned her over to immigration authorities. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agreed to defer action on her case for a year, allowing her to complete her classes.\par \par \uc2 A coalition of immigrant rights and civil liberties groups sent a letter Tuesday and held a news conference just before the regents' meeting Wednesday urging the regents to reject the proposal.\par \par \uc2 The activists argued that academically qualified \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students shouldn't be barred from attending some of the state's top schools and that federal databases used to check immigration status are error-prone.\par \par \uc2 Many of the students are brought to the U.S. by their parents as young children and have grown up here, said Azadeh Shahshahani of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia. It is a "matter of fundamental fairness" to allow these \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to attend these schools, she said.\par \par \uc2 Shahshahani said she was extremely disappointed by the vote.\par \par \uc2 "We're going to actively monitor the situation and investigate whether there are ways to challenge this proposition that was voted on today," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101013e6ad0011f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc12}{\*\bkmkend toc12}\b \uc2 Brown, Whitman toss barbs, rehash previous campaign themes in final Calif gubernatorial debate\b0\par\par\uc2 By SAMANTHA YOUNG   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,080 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 October 2010\par 03:13\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) - Coming into their final debate of the California governor's race, Democrat Jerry Brown and Republican Meg Whitman had a chance to persuade a statewide audience they could turn around the economically troubled state.\par \par \uc2 Instead, their third face-to-face exchange resorted to many of the personal attacks that have dominated the last few weeks of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Neither candidate presented any new ideas in a contest that is virtually tied just three weeks before Election Day and in which a fifth of voters remain undecided. A poll released two weeks ago found about half the respondents were dissatisfied with both candidates.\par \par \uc2 Before Brown and Whitman walked on stage, moderator and former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw told the audience at Dominican University that he planned to address not just the critical economic woes facing the nation's most populous state but the tone of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 The debate followed several weeks of personal attacks that had both candidates on the defensive -- Whitman over revelations that her housekeeper was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and Brown over an audio tape in which a female campaign aide called Whitman a "whore" for pandering to a Los Angeles police union.\par \par \uc2 While the first few minutes of the debate were civil, with Brown and Whitman touting California's potential and the tough decisions ahead, much of the hour-long face-off was dominated with rehashed verbal jousting on nearly every issue.\par \par \uc2 It left 66-year-old independent voter Tom Callinam of Mill Valley with little insight into the candidates' plans if elected governor.\par \par \uc2 "I have a hard choice. I haven't decided yet. I don't think that debate helped because of all the canned answers," said Callinam, who attended the debate. "I would have liked them to answer the questions."\par \par \uc2 Brown, 72, sought to describe Whitman as a billionaire corporate executive who wants to buy herself the state's top job to benefit herself and wealthy friends. Whitman, 54, repeatedly called her rival a career politician beholden to public employee unions who would continue the "same old, same old" failed policies in Sacramento.\par \par \uc2 Brown launched the first attack of the debate, criticizing Whitman's plan to eliminate capital gains taxes, a tax he said would benefit her and her wealthy friends.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Whitman, I'd like to ask you how much money would you save if these tax breaks were in effect this year or last year?" he said.\par \par \uc2 Whitman, who smiled and laughed at the question, shot back, saying "Jerry Brown's just wrong about this." She went on to explain how such a cut would encourage job creation and bring more revenue into the state. She did not say how much she pays in capital gains taxes, although she acknowledged she was an investor who would benefit.\par \par \uc2 "You know what? I'm an investor, and investors will benefit from this but so will job creators, and I was a job creator," Whitman said.\par \par \uc2 She also accused Brown of leaving the state in worse shape than when he began as governor during his tenure from 1975 to 1983. She repeated criticisms, which have been shown to be unfounded by The Associated Press and other news organizations, that unemployment nearly doubled and state spending increased by 120 percent under his watch.\par \par \uc2 Asked about California's spiraling pension costs, Brown said Whitman was the only candidate who has sought to curry favor with unions. He cited her proposal to exempt fire and police from her plans to reform pensions in an attempt to win an endorsement from a Los Angeles police union.\par \par \uc2 That opened the door for Brokaw to ask Brown about an audiotape released last week in which a female aide used the word "whore" in describing Whitman's attempt to win the union's endorsement. Brokaw characterized the comment as offensive to women as a certain slur is for blacks.\par \par \uc2 Brown, who has a reputation for being defensive when under scrutiny, said he disagreed with Brokaw's description and sought to downplay the recording as an old, private conservation picked up on a cell phone. He said his campaign had already apologized.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to get into the term and how it's used, but I would say that the campaign apologized promptly and I affirm that apology," Brown said. "It's unfortunate. I'm sorry it happened, and I apologize."\par \par \uc2 Whitman, whose campaign has fueled the controversy over the last week, sought to push the issue further.\par \par \uc2 "So Jerry, it's not just me. It's the people of California who deserve better than slurs and personal attacks," said Whitman, who just a few days earlier said she wanted to move onto more critical issues in the campaign. "That is not what California is about. It is not our better selves, and I think every Californian and especially women know exactly what's going on here and that is a deeply offensive term to women."\par \par \uc2 She and Brown then argued over whether Whitman should demand an apology from her campaign manager, former Gov. Pete Wilson, who used the term in 1995 in reference to what he felt was Congress' role in helping public employee unions.\par \par \uc2 Wading into another controversy that dominated the previous debate, Brokaw asked Whitman how she could advocate for greater employer accountability in the hiring of illegal immigrants when she had hired an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  as a maid for nine years.\par \par \uc2 The subject is an uncomfortable one for Whitman, who has sought to woo Latino voters with targeted Spanish campaign ads in an effort to erode Brown's support among the traditionally Democratic voter bloc. She responded by calling for an improved federal system that allows employers to more accurately check worker documents, greater boarder security and a guest-worker program.\par \par \uc2 Brown pounced on Whitman's refusal to help her former maid with her immigrant status after she fired her.\par \par \uc2 "After working for nine years, she didn't even get her a lawyer. At least, I could tell you that could be done," Brown said.\par \par \uc2 Whitman repeatedly accused Brown of being beholden to public employee unions, which have spent nearly $20 million boosting his candidacy.\par \par \uc2 Brown said Whitman has accepted about $30 million from outside interests, mostly from corporations and wealthy individuals.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers Juliet Williams and Robin Hindery contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101013e6ad0008e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) - California's gubernatorial candidates engaged in heated exchanges over taxes, job creation and public employee unions in a final debate Tuesday that quickly degenerated into verbal jousting and personal attacks on issues that have dominated the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Republican Meg Whitman and Democrat Jerry Brown had their first testy exchange a few minutes into the debate at Dominican University in San Rafael as the conversation turned to Proposition 13, the 1978 measure approved by California voters that rolled back and capped property taxes.\par \par \uc2 Brown accused Whitman, the billionaire former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive, of promoting a plan to cut regulations and taxes that would benefit her and her wealthy friends. He singled out her proposal to eliminate the capital gains tax. Brown said that would benefit millionaires and billionaires most.\par \par \uc2 "I'd like to ask you how much money will you save if this tax break went into effect?" Brown asked Whitman.\par \par \uc2 She demurred, saying her business was creating jobs, and Brown's business is politics.\par \par \uc2 Whitman then accused Brown, the state attorney general, of leaving the state in worse shape than when he began as governor during his tenure from 1975 to 1983.\par \par \uc2 "You have been part of the war on jobs in this state for 40 years," she said.\par \par \uc2 The candidates began the debate saying California must live within its means before it can be turned around, each saying that they are hopeful about its future.\par \par \uc2 "The California dream is broken," Whitman said, adding that "tough trade-offs" were needed to control the size of government.\par \par \uc2 Brown acknowledged that the state, saddled with persistent budget deficits, must realize its limits.\par \par \uc2 The debate quickly changed course, though, as the candidates debated issues that have been front-and-center in the campaign, including the cost of public employee pensions, education, the environment and immigration. At times the two talked over moderator and former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw as they offered rebuttals of their opponent's claims.\par \par \uc2 One of the most colorful exchanges came when Brokaw asked Brown about an audiotape released last week in which a female aide used the word "whore" in describing Whitman's attempt to curry favor with the union representing Los Angeles police officers.\par \par \uc2 "It's unfortunate, I'm sorry it happened, and I apologize," he said.\par \par \uc2 Whitman said the term was not befitting of a gubernatorial campaign.\par \par \uc2 "It's not just me. It's (the) people of California who deserve better than slurs and personal attacks," she said. "I think every Californian and especially women know exactly what's going on here."\par \par \uc2 They then argued over whether Whitman should demand an apology from her campaign manager, former Gov. Pete Wilson, who used the term in 1995 in reference to what he felt was Congress' role in helping public employee unions.\par \par \uc2 Whitman said that situation was completely different, prompting Brown to fire back, "It's not."\par \par \uc2 The debate was their final opportunity before a statewide audience to promote their plans for turning around the economically troubled state. It comes just three weeks before Election Day, with some voters beginning to cast their ballots and others just starting to tune in.\par \par \uc2 In one exchange, Brown defended his record as governor, saying Whitman's accusations about state spending during that time were "demonstrably false." He said taxes went down when he was in Sacramento, but regulations have been added in the nearly three decades since he left.\par \par \uc2 Whitman called Brown's response a "classic politician answer. It's a half-answer and therefore a dishonest answer." She said unemployment nearly doubled under Brown's tenure and accused him of spending beyond the state's means.\par \par \uc2 Brokaw then interjected with his own fact-check, noting that the end of Brown's term came in the midst of a national recession, and four states that had Republican governors then had higher unemployment rates.\par \par \uc2 Whitman repeatedly accused Brown of being beholden to public employee unions that have spent nearly $20 million boosting his candidacy; Brown responded that it was Whitman who courted police and firefighter unions by promising to exempt their pensions from her plans to roll back benefits.\par \par \uc2 Whitman sought to portray herself as an outsider and said the $142 million she has given her campaign to date -- including a $20 million contribution that was filed with the state as the candidates debated -- means she will not be beholden to special interests. She said Brown would bring more of the same budget gridlock.\par \par \uc2 "If you like the process we have in Sacramento, if you think it's working for Californians, you should elect Jerry Brown," she said.\par \par \uc2 Brown noted that Whitman has accepted about $30 million from outside interests, mostly from corporations and wealthy individuals.\par \par \uc2 Whitman also has been forced to address questions surrounding her employment of a housekeeper who was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , an issue that led to an aggressive exchange between the candidates during their second debate.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101013e6ad0005m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BRISTOL, R.I. (AP) - Democrat Peter Kilmartin on Tuesday trumpeted his career as a police officer and state lawmaker while Republican Erik Wallin pointed out he was the only candidate with experience prosecuting felony cases in a wide-ranging debate Tuesday in the Rhode Island attorney general's race.\par \par \uc2 Kilmartin, a retired Pawtucket police captain and 20-year member of the General Assembly, sought to paint himself as the most experienced candidate while Wallin, a former state prosecutor, called Kilmartin politically entrenched, referred pejoratively to the legislature and his opponent's career in it, and accused him of "smoke and mirror" tactics.\par \par \uc2 The three other candidates -- independents Keven McKenna and Robert Rainville and Moderate Christopher Little -- sought to portray themselves as independent and above partisan bickering. The five candidates are vying to succeed outgoing Attorney General Patrick Lynch, who is term-limited, in the Nov. 2 election.\par \par \uc2 They were asked their positions on, among other issues, combating predatory lending, the governor's executive order on illegal immigration, whether police should be forced to record interrogations of suspects accused of major crimes and whether they would challenge the federal health care overhaul enacted this year by Congress.\par \par \uc2 Kilmartin and Wallin disagreed on many topics.\par \par \uc2 Wallin said he would join other attorneys general in suing the Obama administration over a new health care law that requires citizens to buy insurance or pay a penalty. But Kilmartin said he supported the overhaul, saying it was beneficial to children, and that he didn't think it was wise to use state resources challenging it in court.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of whether the state sues, he added, "It will not have an impact on the outcome."\par \par \uc2 Wallin voiced support for a 2008 executive order from Gov. Don Carcieri that requires state agencies and vendors doing businesses with Rhode Island to use a federal database to check the legal working status of new hires. The order also directed state police to assist with immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "Every crime that's committed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is a crime that didn't have to happen if the federal government was carrying out its job, if it was protecting our borders," Wallin said.\par \par \uc2 Kilmartin did not directly answer when asked if he supported the executive order. Instead, he said he supported enlisting the state in Secure Communities, a federal initiative that matches fingerprints of suspects arrested by local police against FBI and Department of Homeland Security records to weed out potential illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The other candidates argued they had the fewest ties to special interests. McKenna, for instance, criticized the attorney general's office for what he said was its historically weak record of attacking national corporations that wrong the average citizen.\par \par \uc2 "Rhode Island has standing just like New York, Connecticut -- all of the 50 states do. Fight," he shouted, "to get your money back!"\par \par \uc2 Kilmartin faced questions about whether he was too connected to the General Assembly to prosecute corruption. At one point, Little held up a newspaper front page showing Kilmartin embracing Central Falls Mayor Charles Moreau, who authorities have said they're investigating for potential malfeasance. Kilmartin rejected those concerns.\par \par \uc2 "I personally take offense when someone violates the public trust all of you put in us to represent you, to protect you, to look after you and your families," he said.\par \par \uc2 Kilmartin and Wallin agreed it would be best if police departments recorded interrogations of suspects accused of committing violent crimes. But Wallin said he wouldn't leave it to state lawmakers to pass a law requiring it.\par \par \uc2 "I don't trust the General Assembly to pass proper legislation that police officers would be able to use under every single circumstance," he said.\par \par \uc2 The candidates were also asked if they'd reopen an investigation into a 2003 nightclub fire that killed 100 people after complaints from survivors and family members that not enough people were charged. Kilmartin and Wallin said they'd be willing to have their offices take a fresh look, and Little said he understood the anger of the victims' relatives but wasn't sure there were grounds to bring additional charges.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101013e6ad0003s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Geller was writing about a matter of public interest as a journalist and so is protected by the First Amendment, the filing said.\par \par \uc2 Stemberger said in a similar filing Tuesday that comments he made about Tarazi are protected by a legal privilege.\par \par \uc2 He also said that any statements he made about the attorney "were made in good faith and upon information and belief that the statements made were true."\par \par \uc2 Tarazi represented the parents of Rifqa Bary, a Christian teenager who fled to Florida, saying she feared harm from her Muslim mother and father. Bary was returned to Ohio last year and placed in foster care while a juvenile court judge tried unsuccessfully to reunite Bary and her parents.\par \par \uc2 Bary left the custody of Franklin County children services when she turned 18 in August. Police investigations in Ohio and Florida found no evidence she would be harmed.\par \par \uc2 Bary, who emigrated from Sri Lanka with her family when she was 5, was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  until she gained her green card last month.\par \par \uc2 Tarazi said Tuesday he had not yet seen the court filings.\par \par \uc2 Stemberger represented Bary in Florida before she was returned to Ohio. Geller has advocated for Bary on Geller's Atlas Shrugs blog.\par \par \uc2 Geller's attorney, David Yerushalmi, said in an interview that nothing his client wrote was defamatory or malicious in the sense of reporting something she knew was false.\par \par \uc2 The Florida Bar's grievance committee said last month it is drafting a misconduct complaint against Stemberger based on a complaint by Tarazi.\par \par \uc2 In his lawsuit, Tarazi said Geller wrongly linked him to Hamas, considered a terrorist group by the U.S. government. He said she also falsely said he was appointed to represent Bary's parents by the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\par \par \uc2 CAIR is a Washington-based Islamic advocacy group. Geller repeatedly refers to Tarazi on her website as a lawyer appointed or selected by CAIR. Her website also includes links to sites alleging CAIR is a terrorist front.\par \par \uc2 Geller also leads an organization called Stop Islamization of America that placed ads on New York City buses last spring, offering information to those wishing to leave Islam. And she organized a protest on Sept. 11 in New York against a proposed Islamic cultural center to be built near ground zero.\par \par \uc2 Tarazi said he has never worked for CAIR or been appointed by the group to represent Bary's parents. He said he worked for the couple pro bono except for some minor expenses his clients paid for.\par \par \uc2 Tarazi said his mother volunteered as a secretary with CAIR-Ohio in Columbus but left that position three years ago.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101013e6ad0002b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) - Two young men were filled with alcohol and testosterone -- and, as prosecutors charge, ethnic hatred -- when they took part in the fatal beating of a Mexican immigrant two years ago.\par \par \uc2 Now it's up to a jury to decide whether they are guilty of a federal hate crime.\par \par \uc2 Jury deliberations will begin Thursday in the trial of former high school football players Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak, charged in the July 2008 death of a 25-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in the small town of Shenandoah.\par \par \uc2 In her summation to the all-white jury, Justice Department prosecutor Myesha Braden said Wednesday that Donchak, now 20, and Piekarsky, now 18, were motivated by their dislike of Shenandoah's growing Hispanic population when they beat and kicked Luis Ramirez during a random late-night encounter in a park.\par \par \uc2 Afterward, she said, the young men joked about what they had done and plotted to lie to the police.\par \par \uc2 "They showed no remorse that night ... no sense of responsibility for having beaten a man to the point of death," Braden said.\par \par \uc2 The defendants, along with two of their friends who have already pleaded guilty, "acted as a team," she said. "As a team they issued racial threats and slurs. They told him as a team to go back to Mexico. And they beat him as a team. The defendants are responsible together for what happened to Luis Ramirez."\par \par \uc2 Donchak and Piekarsky were charged in federal court with violating Ramirez's civil rights after an all-white jury in Schuylkill County cleared them of serious state charges last year.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors allege that Piekarsky delivered a fatal kick to Ramirez's head after he'd been knocked unconscious by another teen, Colin Walsh, who pleaded guilty in federal court and testified against his former friends last week.\par \par \uc2 Donchak took part in the fight and then conspired with Shenandoah police to cover up the crime, federal prosecutors say. The accused officers are scheduled to go on trial early next year.\par \par \uc2 Both defendants are charged under criminal provisions of the Fair Housing Act, while Donchak faces additional counts related to the cover-up. The hate crime charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\par \par \uc2 As they have all along, defense attorneys insisted Wednesday that the fight stemmed from youthful aggression -- not ethnic hatred.\par \par \uc2 "Brandon Piekarsky is not, nor has he ever been, a racist," said James Swetz, Piekarsky's attorney.\par \par \uc2 He ridiculed the government's theory that Donchak and Piekarsky intended to deprive Ramirez of his federally protected housing rights, saying they didn't even know that Ramirez lived in Shenandoah.\par \par \uc2 The fight began late in the evening of July 12, 2008, when a half-dozen drunken teens, all football players at Shenandoah Valley High School, were walking home from a block party and came across Ramirez and his 15-year-old girlfriend in a park. A verbal altercation escalated into a wild melee, with punches thrown on both sides.\par \par \uc2 The young people who brawled that night were "too filled with street pride, easily inclined toward crass language, too quick to anger," said Donchak's attorney, William Fetterhoff. They lacked "maturity, judgment, prudence and self-restraint -- Luis Ramirez included."\par \par \uc2 Fetterhoff said Ramirez bore some responsibility for what happened to him. The initial fight was over when Ramirez -- enraged by ethnic slurs that one of the teens, Brian Scully, continued hurling at him from down the street -- charged and began clubbing Scully in the back of the head.\par \par \uc2 That brought Walsh's knockout punch, following by the kick to the head. The defense claims Scully, not Piekarsky, kicked Ramirez as he lay unconscious in the street.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez, said Fetterhoff, "didn't deserve to die. But he would be alive today if he had left."\par \par \uc2 Calling his client "Beer Muscles Piekarsky," Swetz said the teen was spoiling for a fight that night, regardless of ethnicity.\par \par \uc2 He repeatedly reminded jurors that Piekarsky was only 16 at the time of the assault, an age, he said, when boys are more concerned about driving privileges and girls than housing rights.\par \par \uc2 Justice Department prosecutor Gerard Hogan, delivering a rebuttal, reminded jurors that youth may not be used as a defense.\par \par \uc2 He argued that Piekarsky and Donchak formed an intent to hurt Ramirez the moment they saw him.\par \par \uc2 "What did they know about him? They knew he was a Mexican. They knew he was a 'spic,'" said Hogan, his voice rising. "They knew he didn't belong in their town."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101013e6ad002m8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) - One of the defendants charged with a federal hate crime in the beating death of a Mexican immigrant threatened to start a "civil war" if Hispanics in the small Pennsylvania coal town retaliated, a witness testified Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Jesse Gomez told jurors at the trial of Derrick Donchak and Brandon Piekarsky that Donchak made the statement to him two days after the assault on Luis Ramirez, a 25-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say Donchak, now 20, and Piekarsky, now 18, were motivated by their dislike of Hispanics when they fought with Ramirez on July 12, 2008. Defense attorneys say ethnicity had nothing to do with the brawl between Ramirez and a group of white teenagers, all of whom played football at Shenandoah Valley High School.\par \par \uc2 Justice Department prosecutors rested their case Tuesday, ending with witness testimony that made clear there was bad blood between white teens and Hispanic teens in Shenandoah, a hardscrabble town about 80 miles northwest of Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 Gomez, a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent, described a confrontation he had with Donchak on July 14, shortly after Ramirez died.\par \par \uc2 He and Donchak were both attending summer classes that day at Bloomsburg University. He said he confronted Donchak and that Donchak told him: "Do not try anything. We will start a civil war in Shenandoah." He said Donchak told him his friends had "powerful weapons."\par \par \uc2 Defense attorney William Fetterhoff hinted that it was Gomez who was making threats, telling Donchak that he would obtain guns for his Hispanic friends.\par \par \uc2 Fetterhoff also asked Gomez whether he told Donchak: "All you white boys are gonna die. ... You better watch your back. Something is gonna happen to you or your family." Gomez denied it, but he acknowledged challenging Donchak to a fight.\par \par \uc2 Later Tuesday, the defense called several witnesses who testified about an earlier encounter in which they said Gomez tried to run over a white teen, Kory Hruniuk, at a downtown Shenandoah intersection. A group of white teens who saw what happened assaulted Gomez's SUV, and later a group of older Hispanic men with bats showed up, Hruniuk testified. He said a 50-something man smashed a windshield and then clubbed Hruniuk on the knee.\par \par \uc2 Hruniuk, now an 18-year-old college student, and several other defense witnesses disputed Gomez's claim that Donchak was there for that fight and used a metal pipe to hit Gomez's car. Another teenager, Nick Nilewski, took the stand and admitted he, not Donchak, had the pipe.\par \par \uc2 Donchak and Piekarsky were charged in federal court with violating Ramirez's civil rights after an all-white jury in Schuylkill County cleared them of serious state charges last year.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors allege that Piekarsky delivered a fatal kick to Ramirez's head after he'd already been knocked unconscious by another teen, Colin Walsh, who pleaded guilty in federal court and testified against his former friends last week.\par \par \uc2 Donchak took part in the fight and then conspired with Shenandoah police to cover up the crime, federal prosecutors say.\par \par \uc2 Jurors on Tuesday heard from an important witness to Ramirez's attack: Josh Redmond, the only teen who wasn't drunk that night. He also has never been charged with a crime, unlike other teens testifying for the prosecution who defense attorneys say have motive to lie.\par \par \uc2 The fight began late in the evening when a half-dozen drunken teens were walking home from a block party and came across Ramirez and his 15-year-old girlfriend in a park. A verbal altercation escalated into a brawl. Ramirez threw the first punch, Redmond said.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors allege the teens met the next day to come up with a cover story, omitting that they had been drinking, that racial slurs were uttered and that there was a kick.\par \par \uc2 Redmond agreed that he and his friends made a pact to lie about what happened -- but only because one of them, Brian Scully, had already given a false statement to police.\par \par \uc2 "It would sound like Brian was lying if we all came out with different stories," Redmond said.\par \par \uc2 Redmond, who has since joined the Navy, also testified that he heard Donchak yell a slur at Ramirez at the beginning of the fight. But he said he didn't hear Piekarsky call Ramirez any derogatory names.\par \par \uc2 He also contradicted a key prosecution claim: that Piekarsky screamed, after kicking Ramirez in the head, "You tell your Mexican friends to get the (expletive) out of Shenandoah or you're going to be (expletive) laying next to him!"\par \par \uc2 Scully, not Piekarsky, made the statement, according to Redmond. The defense accuses Scully of being the kicker.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101012e6ac001yd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

In the first, at the University of California, Davis, Whitman and Brown displayed their different approaches to governing on everything from education to job creation to negotiating with public employee unions.\par \par \uc2 The substance was quickly overwhelmed the following day after revelations that Whitman's housekeeper of nine years was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Their second debate, at California State University, Fresno, was aimed at Latino voters and came just days after Whitman acknowledged having the maid, Nicky Diaz Santillan, on her payroll, but claimed she did not know the worker was illegally in the country before she fired her in June 2009. She then turned the woman down when she requested help for potentially gain legal status.\par \par \uc2 The incident was problematic for Whitman politically because she consistently has said that employers who hire illegal immigrants should be fined, but she did not turn the woman over to authorities when she learned of her status.\par \par \uc2 After days of unflattering stories about Whitman's association with the maid, the mudslinging came Brown's way.\par \par \uc2 A Los Angeles police union leaked an audio tape in which a Brown campaign aide -- apparently a woman -- can be heard calling Whitman a "whore" as campaign staffers discussed her proposal to exempt some public safety unions from her plans to cut pension benefits for public employees.\par \par \uc2 Public opinion polls taken before either of the controversies surfaced showed the candidates in a virtual tie, with nearly one in five voters still undecided.\par \par \uc2 The comments made by a Brown aide seem to have hurt him less than the revelations about Whitman, said Thad Kousser, an assistant professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego.\par \par \uc2 "Jerry Brown has the momentum, and he wants to not get pulled into a "He said-she said" about the scandals," Kousser said. "She'd be more than happy to move on, as well. ... She needs to get back to what she did well in the first debate, which was making this about change and new ideas for California's government versus someone who's been in Sacramento."\par \par \uc2 Polls show that creating jobs and turning around the economy top the list of concerns for California voters.\par \par \uc2 Official unemployment has been stuck above 12 percent for more than a year, but the unofficial rate is much higher because many Californians have simply given up looking for work. At the same time, millions are underemployed in part-time or temporary jobs.\par \par \uc2 The state also has been hit by home foreclosures and years of multibillion dollar budget deficits that have cut core services and led to skyrocketing college and university fees.\par \par \uc2 Former NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw will moderate the debate at the 2,000-student private university, which was founded by Dominican nuns but is now independent.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101012e6ac0001r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - In a story Oct. 8 about 365 prisoners who were identified as illegal immigrants while serving terms for sex crimes, The Associated Press incorrectly included 183 U.S. citizens in that group. The 365 illegal immigrants face deportation as convicted sex offenders after they serve their current sentences, according to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. In addition, the 183 dual-national U.S. citizens identified as sex offenders during the ICE investigation also face deportation to their countries of origin, the agency said.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101009e6a9002bm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California voters face a clear choice when they vote for governor in November: A disciplined executive who wants to bring business sense to state government, or an old political hand who says he has the skills to guide the state through troubled times.\par \par \uc2 On the Republican side is Meg Whitman, a political neophyte who amassed a fortune in the corporate world and who runs a tightly scripted campaign focused on polling and targeting specific groups of potential voters. The Democrats have nominated Jerry Brown, a 72-year-old career politician well-known for his candor, gaffes and less-is-more style of campaigning.\par \par \uc2 Former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive Whitman, 54, and Brown, the state's attorney general, are running neck-and-neck in an increasingly negative campaign that has been marked by Whitman's record-breaking spending and Brown's caginess.\par \par \uc2 Both have had tremendous professional success in their divergent careers, and yet voters are split, or uncertain, about who might be best to lead the nation's most populous state out of its financial morass. The state is best by deep disillusionment with government and the political process.\par \par \uc2 Voters also have heard these candidates' stories before, says University of California, Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain: A moderate Democrat who often is at odds with his party's base, and a wealthy first-time candidate who wants to apply principles from the business world to state government.\par \par \uc2 "Neither approach has worked miraculously in the past, so there's a lot of voters looking for the best of, shall we say, imperfect choices," Cain said.\par \par \uc2 And neither candidate has offered a detailed solution to the issues voters care most about: high unemployment, sinking home values and persistent, deep budget cuts that have led to teacher layoffs, dirty bathrooms at state parks and a host of other service cuts.\par \par \uc2 Brown and Whitman have promised to cut wasteful spending, further reform pensions and create an emergency fund to help the state weather dips in state revenue, all ideas promoted by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger that have stalled at times in the Legislature. Both say they would meet with lawmakers early to take up the state's fiscal mess, rather than waiting until spring.\par \par \uc2 Whoever is elected will inherit another multibillion-dollar budget deficit, in part because Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders approved a state budget that tries to cover most of the state's $19 billion deficit through rosy revenue assumptions and creative accounting.\par \par \uc2 But the modest pension reforms accomplished this year could lead to future savings, and the next governor could benefit from a lower threshold to pass budgets through the Legislature if voters approve an initiative on the November ballot. In a few years, more moderate politicians might also be sent to Sacramento because of open primaries and independent redistricting, ballot reforms championed by Schwarzenegger.\par \par \uc2 With unemployment stuck above 12 percent, Whitman spent months honing her message of job creation, cutting government spending and fixing schools during a tight primary race with state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner, while Brown waited out the summer in anticipation of an expensive campaign.\par \par \uc2 Whitman, who has spent $140 million on her campaign, appeared to be gaining ground in the polls after intensely targeting crucial independents, who account for one in five registered California voters, and Latinos, who are a growing segment of the electorate.\par \par \uc2 But her carefully plotted strategy was thrown off track last month when her former housekeeper of nine years revealed she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and accused Whitman of turn away when she sought help. Whitman, who hired the maid through an employment agency, said she did not know the worker was illegal until she admitted it in 2009; Whitman then fired her.\par \par \uc2 After a long political career in which he's taken evolving positions on everything from taxes to the death penalty, Brown often is seen as a flip-flopper. In one Whitman campaign ad using footage from his 1992 presidential primary race against Bill Clinton, Clinton says of Brown: "You know, he reinvents himself every year or two."\par \par \uc2 The negative portraits painted by their opponents could be key with independent voters, for whom character is a critical issue. Democrats and one of the state's largest unions are questioning Whitman's compassion for illegal immigrants in campaign mailers and ads; Whitman is now seeking to soften her image with a new ad in which she talks directly into the camera about her goals for California.\par \par \uc2 "It really comes down to the issue of character. Who do you trust, who is saying what he or she believes and is he or she sticking to it?" said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political science professor at the University of Southern California.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has surpassed the U.S. record for personal spending on a campaign, giving her bid $122 million from her own bank account. She easily eclipses Brown, who has spent just $11 million to date.\par \par \uc2 But the Democrat has had help from union-backed political committees that have spent more than $13 million so far in the general election, according to the Fair Political Practices Commission. That adds to the GOP perception that Brown is too cozy with public employee unions. Whitman also has benefited from more than $1 million in independent spending.\par \par \uc2 Both candidates say they oppose raising taxes, but Whitman wants to eliminate several taxes she says hurt California businesses, including the manufacturing tax, the capital gains tax paid by wealthy residents and a fee charged to small businesses at startup.\par \par \uc2 Brown says those are corporate giveaways that would not help the state's neediest residents and would only add to California's massive budget deficits, while Whitman has accused Brown of political expediency for his change of heart on Proposition 13, the 1978 initiative that capped property taxes.\par \par \uc2 Whitman also wants to cut the state work force by 40,000 employees, although it's unclear how she would accomplish that. She has pledged to create 2 million private sector jobs. Brown has proposed creating half a million jobs by investing in clean energy and building new transmission lines for renewable power.\par \par \uc2 They also differ on the environment. Brown has defended California's landmark global warming law as attorney general and opposes a November ballot measure, Proposition 23, that would suspend the law. Whitman also opposes Proposition 23, but wants to suspend the 2006 global warming law if elected so she can reevaluate its effect on the state's economy.\par \par \uc2 With the candidates stuck in a dead heat, the winner could be decided by a slim margin.\par \par \uc2 Buoyed by voter upset over bank bailouts and the still sputtering economy, Republicans nationwide are hoping for a surge this November, or at least to take advantage of a so-called "enthusiasm gap" with Democrats. It's unclear how far that might push Whitman in California, where Democrats have a 13-point registration advantage.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101009e6a90005s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Much of Meg Whitman's life has been defined by discipline, from plotting her education and career trajectory to her eventual run for California governor.\par \par \uc2 Her campaign has followed the same methodical template. By generously tapping her personal fortune, Whitman formed a campaign platform and execution plan early with an experienced, high-priced team of Republican operatives.\par \par \uc2 So far, the nearly $122 million she has poured into her campaign from her personal fortune has pulled her into a tie with Democrat Jerry Brown in public opinion polls.\par \par \uc2 But the billionaire former chief executive of online auction site \uc2 eBay\uc2  is learning that in politics, it's sometimes the intangibles that make the difference.\par \par \uc2 Whitman, 54, has been slow to reveal much about herself on the campaign trail, instead preferring to focus on her messages about job creation and cutting government spending and regulations.\par \par \uc2 Her reluctance to open herself personally has allowed her opponents to draw their own characterizations of her, at times relying on unflattering incidents.\par \par \uc2 First came revelations that Whitman shoved an \uc2 eBay\uc2  employee during a disagreement. The company reached a confidential six-figure settlement with the employee, who remains on the job. Whitman called the altercation an anomaly and said it taught her to always be professional.\par \par \uc2 Last month, Whitman's former housekeeper of nine years, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who Whitman says admitted using fraudulent documents, alleged she was mistreated and says Whitman shunned her when she asked for help pursuing legal residency in the U.S. Whitman said the housekeeper, Nicky Diaz Santillan, was like a member of her own family, but there was little she could do to help after the worker admitted lying about her status.\par \par \uc2 Whitman's mother described her daughter's focus in an interview last year with More magazine, before her death at age 89. Margaret Whitman said her daughter was intense and competitive at childhood swim meets.\par \par \uc2 "At meets, I had to be there, because if she wasn't at least first or second, she'd be screaming with rage. There was no second best for her. She has always loved to win," she told the magazine.\par \par \uc2 Whitman's drive also was evident in the classroom. She graduated from high school in three years, then earned a bachelor's degree in economics and an MBA from Harvard by the time she was 23.\par \par \uc2 In her book, "The Power of Many," she calls her marriage of 30 years to Dr. Griffith Harsh IV, a Stanford neurosurgeon whom she met at Harvard, a merger of Type A personalities.\par \par \uc2 That Whitman would run for governor seems somewhat incongruous. She acknowledges that she rarely voted and has done little in the way of public or community service.\par \par \uc2 The role of candidate does not seem like a natural next step after her ascent through corporate America, from former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's investment firm, \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2 ., to blue-chip companies that include \uc2 Disney\uc2 , Stride-Rite shoes and Michigan-based FTD, the flower-delivery company.\par \par \uc2 After nearly 10 years at \uc2 eBay\uc2 , which made her a billionaire, Whitman emerged on the political stage as an economic adviser to Romney's 2008 presidential primary campaign.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has been a trailblazer for women in business, although she chooses not to dwell on issues of sexism. She says in her book that she survived in the male-dominated business world by focusing on delivering results and trying not to show weakness.\par \par \uc2 Still, at \uc2 Disney\uc2  in the late 1980s, "it often seemed like pure testosterone flowed in the drinking fountains," she writes.\par \par \uc2 Whitman juggled a busy lifestyle throughout her career, refusing to scale back on her professional ambitions even as she and her husband had two sons. Griff Jr., 26, works for Romney's son, and Will, 24, is in his final year at Princeton, his mother and brother's alma mater. Neither has appeared on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has often referred to her mother as a source of inspiration for her successful career and for her decision to seek the Republican nomination for governor.\par \par \uc2 Her mother exposed Whitman and her older brother and sister to sometimes eclectic opportunities. She was the driving force behind summertime, cross-country adventures when the children were young and once had the family rent a tool shed from a resident on the otherwise ritzy island of St. John in the Virgin Islands, sleeping on air mattresses.\par \par \uc2 Whitman also has adopted elements of her mother's frugality, in spite of her outsize spending on her gubernatorial campaign. Whitman's fortune was estimated at more than $1.3 billion before her bid for office, yet she often chooses to eat at middle-of-the-road chain restaurants on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 She says there is no contradiction between her proposals to be frugal with the people's money and her own record-setting spending. Instead, it's just part of a disciplined approach.\par \par \uc2 "My view is I'm running a smart campaign. I want to have the best team, I want to be out there with the right message," she said at a recent campaign event. "So I want to be smart about it and strategic about it."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101009e6a90004l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NOGALES, Ariz. (AP) - Government officials on Friday showed off a site where National Guard members have been deployed near the Mexican border, despite criticism that the troops will do nothing to stem the tide of illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The first troops began their mission on Aug. 30, and no member of the media had been allowed to see firsthand what they've been doing despite repeated requests from dozens of outlets.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, the Border Patrol at last granted access to a site where four troops were stationed in a desert area about a mile away from the bustling southeastern Arizona border city of Nogales.\par \par \uc2 At the site, media members outnumbered the troops, and surrounded the only one who would answer questions, although he declined to provide his name and said he personally hadn't seen any illegal activity during his deployment.\par \par \uc2 One Guardsman at the site stood on a dusty overlook peering into binoculars with an M-16 slung over his arm. He looked at the rolling hills surrounding Nogales, both on the Arizona and Mexican side. Reporters were allowed at the site for about 20 minutes before being escorted away.\par \par \uc2 The troops have been acting as the "extra eyes and ears" of the Border Patrol. They have no arrest power, and the guns they carry are only for self-defense. Their mission is to remain at "strategic locations" and look for and report any suspected illegal immigrants to the Border Patrol, whose agents make the arrest.\par \par \uc2 The 532 troops in the state are part of President Barack Obama's plan to beef up border security by stationing 1,200 National Guard members along the border from California to Texas; all the troops are in place in the four border states, performing the same mission.\par \par \uc2 But many question just how big an impact the troops will have at the porous border, especially in Arizona. The state is the busiest crossing point for illegal immigrants, and the Border Patrol says between 40 percent and 50 percent of all immigrant arrests each year on the border are made here.\par \par \uc2 Arizona state Sen. Russell Pearce has been a sharp critic of the deployment and the National Guard's inability to make arrests, calling the troops a "welcome wagon" for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Pearce, a Republican, said the only way to stop illegal immigrants is to put 30,000 troops on the border with arrest power.\par \par \uc2 "They're military, and instead of letting them do their job, we let them down there with typewriter ribbon and oil cans," said Pearce, who wrote Arizona's controversial immigration legislation. "We send them overseas in harm's way but we don't let them defend our own borders in a proper manner?\par \par \uc2 "They've got political handcuffs on them," he added.\par \par \uc2 Pearce said the deployment is not much different from the time President George W. Bush's deployed 6,000 National Guard troops to the border in June 2006. Those troops also had no arrest power and were pulled out in July 2008.\par \par \uc2 One incident during their deployment disturbed Pearce. National Guard troops backed off and called in federal agents as gunmen approached their Arizona post.\par \par \uc2 While supporters of the troops' actions said the Guard members did as they were supposed to, Pearce questioned the point of having troops on the border if they can't confront such dangers.\par \par \uc2 "It's embarrassing to the military, it's embarrassing to America, and it's a shameful response by the federal government," he said.\par \par \uc2 About 400 illegal immigrants have been arrested in Arizona after being spotted by National Guard troops this summer. That not only makes the border safer but also makes Arizona and the rest of the nation safer, Victor Manjarrez Jr., chief of the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector, said at a press briefing on Friday.\par \par \uc2 "Any resources we get onto the border help us in all matters," Manjarrez said. "It's quite clear the National Guardsmen are going to improve capabilities. We've seen that in the very short time they've been deployed."\par \par \uc2 Southern Arizona rancher Ed Ashurst said as far as he's concerned, the Guard deployment hasn't affected border security one bit.\par \par \uc2 "I don't see them and I don't know anybody that has seen them. Where are they?" said Ashurst, whose property neighbors that of slain rancher Robert Krentz, who was gunned down in March while checking water lines on his property near the border.\par \par \uc2 Authorities believe -- but have never produced substantive proof -- that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , likely a scout for drug smugglers, was to blame for Krentz's killing.\par \par \uc2 "My family's in danger, my property is trashed, my home has been burglarized multiple times and I don't see the federal government doing anything to help me or my neighbors," Ashurst said.\par \par \uc2 Cmdr. Jill Nelson, who heads the National Guard deployment in Arizona, told The Associated Press on Friday that the sites where troops are located were chosen strategically by the Border Patrol, and that they're mostly in remote locations where ranchers wouldn't see them.\par \par \uc2 "You're not going to see a line of Guard members outside the Tucson sector," she said.\par \par \uc2 Fred Solop, a pollster at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, said the Obama administration deployed the troops to send a clear message to the American public that the federal government is responding to the immigration issue.\par \par \uc2 "There's a symbolic value to them being there, but I think there's some actual value in the work they're doing," Solop said. "Could they be doing more? The immigration voices in Arizona would like to see more, but will they do that? That has yet to be seen."\par \par \uc2 A National Guard sergeant who spoke to reporters about the troops' mission, although he declined to provide his name for security reasons, said he couldn't comment on whether he thinks the deployment had anything to do with politics but said that he and other Guardsmen felt they were being effective.\par \par \uc2 "I've seen a group of young professional soldiers execute an important mission," he said. "We are making a difference."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101008e6a8001an\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

BONNER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 650 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 October 2010\par 20:03\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOISE, Idaho (AP) - A national group that supports curbs on immigration has weighed in on Idaho's 1st Congressional District race, calling both Democratic U.S. Rep Walt Minnick and his Republican challenger "true reformers."\par \par \uc2 NumbersUSA reports both Minnick and state lawmaker Raul Labrador won the label after filling out the group's 12-question survey on immigration. The issue that has become a centerpiece of the congressional race, with Minnick's campign launching TV and radio ads targeted at Labrador's work as an immigration attorney.\par \par \uc2 The Arlington, Va.-based group also gave Minnick a B grade based on his voting record in the U.S. House. Minnick would have earned an A had he shown more leadership on immigration-related legislation, NumbersUSA president Roy Beck said.\par \par \uc2 "All of his votes have been right, as far as we're concerned," Beck said.\par \par \uc2 The group did not give Labrador a grade because he doesn't have a record in federal office.\par \par \uc2 On the survey, Minnick and Labrador agreed on all but one of the 12 questions.\par \par \uc2 Minnick said he wouldn't support a move by Congress to deny automatic U.S. citizenship to children born to undocumented persons. Labrador did not take a position on the question, though he has said in the past that he would not support changes to the 14th amendment, which guarantees citizenship for those born on U.S. soil.\par \par \uc2 The Minnick campaign said Labrador appears to be deliberately vague on his position, but Labrador spokesman Phil Hardy said that's not the case. The survey asked candidates to mark "yes" or "no" or "not taking a position" and did not give Labrador room to fully explain his stance on the issue, Hardy said.\par \par \uc2 "That's why Raul hates surveys that reduce politics to yes/no questions," Hardy said. "Politics often involve complex issues that are not well-served by yes/no surveys."\par \par \uc2 During an August 19 interview on KBOI radio, Labrador explained his position when asked about the "anchor babies" issue. The term, considered derogatory by some, is a reference to children born to at least one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parent.\par \par \uc2 "You don't have to repeal or change the 14th amendment to fix this issue," Labrador said. "We can go through the legislative process and sort of define who becomes a citizen."\par \par \uc2 Hardy said that Minnick is the one who is being inconsistent on immigration.\par \par \uc2 On the survey, both Minnick and Labrador said they oppose offering the estimated 11 million people living illegally in America long-term work permits and/or a path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Hardy provided audio of Minnick speaking at a meeting of the Boise Young Professionals in April 2009.\par \par \uc2 At the meeting, Minnick said he would require people living in the country illegally to come out of the shadows, and proposed a system that would appoint immigration magistrates to consider each case.\par \par \uc2 "If a person had a job, if they'd kept their nose clean, if they were good citizens, I would have that magistrate assess an appropriate penalty, and it might well be monetary, and put them in the back of the line for legal immigration. I wouldn't send them home," Minnick said during the meeting.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's quite a practical way of dealing with the problem of 12 million people who are here illegally."\par \par \uc2 While Labrador's campaign said this comment amounts to support for amnesty, Minnick's campaign disagreed and said the he has always supported punishment for people who commit the crime of illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Minnick "has been consistent in saying the country needs a workable solution to this problem," Minnick campaign manager John Foster said. "That includes tough penalties for those who have violated our laws."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 NumbersUSA: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.numbersusa.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.numbersusa.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101008e6a80000l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Local governments cannot opt out of a federal program that checks the fingerprints of people who are arrested against a database to determine if they are illegal immigrants, the head of the U.S. immigration agency said Friday.\par \par \uc2 That's because the agreement is between the federal and state governments -- not the local governments.\par \par \uc2 Officials in Virginia's Arlington County, Washington, D.C., and Santa Clara County, Calif., have voted recently to opt out of the program, saying it could lead to racial profiling. San Francisco officials have attempted to get out of the program with no luck, and several other communities are debating whether they want to participate.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement website says jurisdictions that do not wish to participate in the Secure Communities program can ask federal immigration officials to remove them from the program.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, ICE Director John Morton said that the agency would meet with the localities to discuss the issue, but that in the end the agreement was with the state.\par \par \uc2 "Our anticipation is that we're going to go forward with Secure Communities as we agreed with the state," Morton told reporters at a news conference touting the arrest of several convicted \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sex offenders in Virginia.\par \par \uc2 Suspects who are arrested for anything from a traffic violation to a violent crime have long been fingerprinted, and those fingerprints are run through a federal criminal background database maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. With Secure Communities, those fingerprints are automatically checked against immigration records maintained by the Department of Homeland Security to identify those who may be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Since 2008, the program has been expanded to more than 650 jurisdictions in 32 states, with plans to incorporate every jurisdiction by 2013. Virginia is one of only four states in which Secure Communities is active in all jurisdictions.\par \par \uc2 Morton stressed that even though the fingerprints are taken by local authorities, it's up to federal officials to enforce immigration law and detain or deport suspects.\par \par \uc2 "No one in the Department of Corrections, no one in Arlington County, no one in the other jurisdictions of Virginia is being asked to enforce federal immigration law," Morton said.\par \par \uc2 One-quarter of Arlington County's residents was born in another country and one-third is multiracial, which adds to fears of racial profiling, said J. Walter Trejada, a member of the county's Board of Supervisors. The board voted unanimously last month to opt out of Secure Communities.\par \par \uc2 "The potential for racial profiling and for unscrupulous law enforcement people to utilize the Secure Communities as a way to intimidate people and cause fear is real," Trejada said.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco Sheriff Michael Hennessey has challenged his city's participation in the program for months, and he likely will meet with ICE officials in November, said department spokeswoman Eileen Hirst.\par \par \uc2 Hirst said the sheriff is concerned that the law is too broad and that most localities already report illegal immigrants to federal authorities. The department has reported roughly 3,500 illegal immigrants to ICE over the past three years, she said.\par \par \uc2 Some officials, such as Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, have welcomed the program. He said it had been "running spectacularly well."\par \par \uc2 In Virginia, jurisdictions are required by state law to send fingerprints to state police to be run through the FBI database. Because the exchange happens at the federal level, that means localities can't really opt out of the program, Cuccinelli said.\par \par \uc2 "It is not a situation where Arlington's fingerprints can be treated differently," Cuccinelli said.\par \par \uc2 ICE credits the program for the removal of more than 40,000 criminal illegal immigrants, including more than 12,000 convicted of violent crimes such as murder, rape and kidnapping.\par \par \uc2 "We're identifying offenders in the criminal justice system who shouldn't be here in the first place who have turned to a life of crime and they go home -- period," Morton said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101008e6a80021p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - State and federal officials this week arrested 15 illegal immigrants who have been convicted of sexual offenses in Virginia and Washington, D.C., and identified another 365 already behind bars who will be deported once they serve their sentences, authorities said Friday.\par \par \uc2 The 15 illegal immigrants arrested, including several whose crimes were against children or teens, had been convicted of sex crimes but had not previously been targeted for deportation. Thirteen were arrested in Virginia, and two in the nation's capital.\par \par \uc2 "Sex offenders are simply a scourge and they deserve our full law enforcement attention," U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton told reporters at a news conference to announce the results of Operation SOAR, or Sexual Offender Alien Removal.\par \par \uc2 Under the SOAR program, ICE agents compared the list of those on the sex offender registry with two federal databases to see who was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Of those sex offenders found to be incarcerated, 183 were U.S. citizens who are now deportable because they committed a crime.\par \par \uc2 More than 60 federal, state and local law enforcement officers participated in the five-day operation. It comes two years after a similar initiative that removed 171 convicted \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sex offenders from Virginia.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Bob McDonnell said the low numbers in the latest operation suggested that programs put in place to identify criminal illegal immigrants before they are released back into the community were working.\par \par \uc2 Officials would not release the identities of those who were arrested, but said they came from eight countries.\par \par \uc2 Statistics released earlier this week show that about half of the nearly 393,000 people deported from the United States during the past year were criminals. Of those, Morton said nearly 6,000 were sex offenders.\par \par \uc2 "If you come to this country lawfully to seek a better life for you and your family we welcome you," Morton said. "If you come to this country illegally and you turn to a life of crime in Virginia, we don't.\par \par \uc2 "Bottom line: Foreign sex offenders have no home in the commonwealth of Virginia."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101008e6a8001vy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) - The trial of two white teenagers charged with a federal hate crime in the beating death of a Mexican immigrant focused Friday on an alleged cover-up orchestrated by police officers with close ties to the defendants.\par \par \uc2 Shenandoah police threatened witnesses, sought the destruction of evidence and tried to place blame where it didn't belong, according to testimony meant to bolster the government's allegation that three former officers obstructed a federal investigation into the July 2008 assault.\par \par \uc2 The officers are scheduled to go on trial early next year, charged with sabotaging the probe into the death of Luis Ramirez, a 25-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , by altering evidence and lying to the FBI.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors in this week's hate crime trial are trying to prove that Derrick Donchak, now 20, and Brandon Piekarsky, now 18, were motivated by their dislike of Hispanics when they took part in the attack on Ramirez, a 25-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , in the former mining town 80 miles northwest of Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 Piekarsky is accused of delivering a fatal kick to Ramirez's head after he'd already been knocked unconscious by another teen, Colin Walsh, who pleaded guilty in federal court last year to violating Ramirez's civil rights and testified Friday against his one-time friends.\par \par \uc2 Donchak also took part in the fight and then conspired with police to cover up the crime, federal prosecutors say.\par \par \uc2 Donchak, Walsh told the jury, "didn't like Hispanic people. He REALLY didn't like Hispanic people."\par \par \uc2 Walsh recalled that Donchak had "White Man's March," a song with racist lyrics from the 1998 film "American History X," loaded onto his iPod. Prosecutors played the song for the all-white jury.\par \par \uc2 "He'd sing along to it" in the car, Walsh said.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys deny the fight had anything to do with Ramirez's ethnicity, calling him the aggressor.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez's married friends, Victor and Arielle Garcia, witnessed part of the brawl on July 12, 2008. Arielle Garcia told jurors Friday that she saw Ramirez get knocked to the ground, then kicked in the head as he lay motionless in the street.\par \par \uc2 As a convulsing Ramirez was being loaded onto an ambulance, Shenandoah Patrolman Jason Hayes arrived on the scene, conferred with Piekarsky, and shook his hand, she said.\par \par \uc2 Hayes then came over to the Garcias, and Victor Garcia identified Piekarsky as one of Ramirez's assailants. Hayes told Garcia: "You'd better be quiet. You wanna be quiet, or I can put you in jail tonight," Arielle Garcia testified.\par \par \uc2 At the time, Hayes was dating Piekarsky's mother.\par \par \uc2 Under cross examination, Arielle Garcia acknowledged never having made the accusation before, either in statements to authorities or in her testimony at a state trial last year.\par \par \uc2 "That will be an issue," said Hayes' attorney, Frank Nocito, who attended Friday's session at the federal courthouse in Scranton.\par \par \uc2 Victor Garcia did not mention Hayes' alleged threat when he took the stand after his wife.\par \par \uc2 The parents of Brian Scully -- who shouted ethnic slurs at Ramirez and has pleaded to juvenile charges of aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation -- also testified about elements of the cover-up.\par \par \uc2 About a week after the fight, Lt. William Moyer, whose son played football with the defendants, called Scully's mother, Julie Mickalowski. "If Brian has a pair of Columbia blue and gray sneakers, you should get rid of them," he advised her, Mickalowski told jurors. "I knew Brian didn't have those sneakers."\par \par \uc2 Moyer's attorney, Enid Harris, declined to comment Friday.\par \par \uc2 A week after that phone call, Moyer showed up at Scully's house after nightfall, parking down the street so he wouldn't be spotted, said Ronald Mickalowski, Scully's stepfather. Staring at the floor, Moyer told the family that he was running for a $70,000-per-year magistrate's job and "he'd ruin his chances of getting it if he was seen or heard at our home," Mickalowski said.\par \par \uc2 Moyer said Scully needed to "confess to what he did," because witnesses had accused him of stomping on Ramirez, Mickalowski said.\par \par \uc2 As Moyer left, Mickalowski said he turned to his son and said, "We were played." Moyer "was trying to get something that wasn't there," he told the jury.\par \par \uc2 An indictment alleges that Moyer and Hayes tried, in their official reports, to "falsely exaggerate" the culpability of a teen identified in court papers as "Participant 2" in order to minimize Piekarsky's role.\par \par \uc2 The defense contends that Scully -- not Piekarsky -- kicked Ramirez in the head. Scully admitted earlier in the trial that he kicked Ramirez, but claimed it was in the shoulder.\par \par \uc2 Walsh, who has pleaded guilty in federal court, testified Friday that he saw Piekarsky deliver the kick, and that Piekarsky later told him that "he kicked the guy so hard his shoe flew off."\par \par \uc2 An all-white jury acquitted Piekarsky and Donchak of serious state charges last year. Piekarsky was acquitted of third-degree murder and ethnic intimidation, while Donchak beat aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation charges. Each was convicted of simple assault.\par \par \uc2 The 2009 verdict angered civil rights groups and Gov. Ed Rendell, who asked for a Justice Department prosecution.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101008e6a8001vs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) - A teenager who gave voice to the spunky heroine of Nickelodeon's "Dora The Explorer" says the network cheated her out of millions of dollars by underpaying her for work on the groundbreaking children's cartoon series.\par \par \uc2 Caitlin Sanchez, 14, didn't get the fees she was due for reruns, recordings for DVDs and other Dora products and hundreds of hours of promotional work, she and her family said in a lawsuit filed against Nickelodeon and its corporate parents.\par \par \uc2 "They took advantage of her," her lawyer, John Balestriere, said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Nickelodeon said Caitlin's claims were baseless, and her contract was extensively negotiated.\par \par \uc2 "She was well-compensated for her work and for personal appearances," network spokesman \uc2 David Bittler\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 "Dora The Explorer," now in its 10th year, has become a cartoon icon and a cultural force.\par \par \uc2 Its bilingual Latina protagonist is a first on U.S. children's television, a giant balloon in the \uc2 Macy's\uc2  Thanksgiving Day Parade, a household name for countless families, and even a figure in the nationwide debate over immigration after a doctored photo of her behind bars as a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  made the rounds online this year.\par \par \uc2 And she's also a brand that averages 1.9 million viewers for each episode and has generated more than $11 billion in sales of related toys, books and DVDs worldwide since 2002.\par \par \uc2 Caitlin has been the voice of 7-year-old Dora since 2007, leading its audiences on whimsical adventures that also help its young viewers learn English and Spanish. She replaced the character's original voice, Kathleen Herles.\par \par \uc2 The Fairview, N.J., teen had done some acting work before "Dora," including on episodes of NBC's "Law and Order: SVU" and "Lipstick Jungle." But the cartoon series marked a big break for the then-12-year-old, who told The Associated Press this summer that she was thrilled to do the job.\par \par \uc2 "It's really an honor to play an icon," she said.\par \par \uc2 That honor has come at a price, her lawsuit says.\par \par \uc2 She and her family were pressured into signing an unfair contract quickly, without consulting a lawyer, and then were subject to "three and a half years of exploitation and lies," according to her suit. Filed Wednesday, it seeks unspecified damages.\par \par \uc2 While she made $5,115 per episode, she wasn't paid or was grossly undercompensated for at least 160 extra hours of recording work, and at least 400 hours of promotions, marketing and interviews, her lawsuit said. While traveling the country to talk up the show, she got only $40 a day, it said.\par \par \uc2 She also wasn't paid her due share of profits from Dora merchandise and her residuals, or rerun fees, for at least 325 airings of her "Dora" episodes -- even as Nickelodeon executives told her she'd played a big role in the show's success, according to her lawsuit. One said there had never been "a more high-profile face to a voice," the lawsuit said.\par \par \uc2 While some new episodes featuring Caitlin's voice haven't aired yet, she's not expected to voice anymore, her lawyer said.\par \par \uc2 Bittler said her "voice changed and she was no longer able to portray the Dora character," but the network had offered her other work. Balestriere said he'd told the network Thursday he didn't foresee that, but she remained open to it if the dispute about her previous pay is resolved.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, she is going on with a typical teenage life, he said.\par \par \uc2 "This was an opportunity for her, but she's doing well in school and could be just fine if she doesn't do any acting anymore," Balestriere said.\par \par \uc2 Nickelodeon is owned by \uc2 Viacom Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101007e6a7002lb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc32}{\*\bkmkend toc32}\b \uc2 Husband of Calif. GOP's Whitman suddenly in spotlight in controversy over illegal worker\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIET WILLIAMS    \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 952 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 October 2010\par 15:48\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Dr. Griffith Harsh, the Stanford University neurosurgeon and husband of Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman, stood quietly by his wife's side last week as she vehemently denied knowing the family's housekeeper of nine years was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As the couple was peppered by questions before the glare of dozens of cameras, Harsh never said a word. By the end of the day, however, the media spotlight was trained on the publicly reticent doctor.\par \par \uc2 He became the target when celebrity attorney Gloria Allred released a 2003 Social Security Administration letter that noted a discrepancy in the housekeeper's employment records. While Whitman said neither she nor her husband had ever seen the letter, it apparently bears Harsh's handwriting: "Nicky Please check this Thanks."\par \par \uc2 Nicky Diaz Santillan was the family's housekeeper for nine years until Whitman says she learned in June 2009 that Diaz Santillan was illegal. She says she immediately fired her.\par \par \uc2 Throughout their 30-year marriage, Harsh has quietly followed his own professional and intellectual pursuits as Whitman, the billionaire former chief executive of \uc2 eBay\uc2 , took on high-profile corporate roles.\par \par \uc2 But their experiences did not prepare them for the public scrutiny of a close governor's race, and the heightened focus on their personal lives that burst around them last week.\par \par \uc2 Until then, Whitman had succeeded in keeping Harsh and the couple's two adult sons, Griff Jr. and Will, out of her race for governor, speaking only generally about them in sound bites and anecdotes that complement her campaign narrative.\par \par \uc2 She has not issued the standard flier picturing her smiling family. Her sons have not appeared on the campaign trail. Griff Harsh V works for Tagg Romney, the son of the former Republican presidential candidate and Whitman friend Mitt Romney, and Will is a senior at Princeton. Whitman's husband sometimes attends speeches when he is not performing surgeries at Stanford Medical Center, where he is on staff.\par \par \uc2 "Griff has always had an understated, modest demeanor," Whitman writes in her book, "The Power of Many," which is about corporate success. "He dislikes anything ostentatious or showy, and he is very serious about living an authentic life focused on things that matter -- family, faith, friends, health, the stewardship of land, important ideas."\par \par \uc2 And he does not generally speak with reporters. When approached after the letter was revealed last week, Harsh calmly walked away from two reporters in the Santa Monica hotel where Whitman's press conference was held, relying instead on a statement from Whitman's campaign that said Harsh does not recall receiving the Social Security letter.\par \par \uc2 From the start, the driven Whitman and Harsh have made career trade-offs with one another, including the decision to move back to California with their young sons from the East Coast in 1998, when Whitman took the job at \uc2 eBay\uc2 . Even their early courtship was put on hold because of their busy schedules while she was at Harvard Business School and he at Harvard Medical School after studying as a Rhodes scholar in England, she writes.\par \par \uc2 Whitman calls them a "type A couple," and at many times the marriage has been long distance. She remained in Cincinnati for \uc2 Procter & Gamble\uc2  Cos. for the first six months after they were married and Harsh moved to San Francisco for his residency; Whitman later took a job heading the Michigan-based FTD flower delivery company while the family was in the Boston area.\par \par \uc2 Harsh's work at Stanford Medical Center includes pioneering a device to target radiation into the brain cavity left by tumor surgery, according to his official Stanford biography. It describes him as a leading expert in certain skull base surgeries.\par \par \uc2 Both Harsh and his brother, who grew up in Birmingham, Ala., followed their father into the neurosurgery profession. Whitman calls him meticulous and detail-oriented, but insists he has a lighter side, too.\par \par \uc2 "Despite his reserved demeanor, Griff has a wonderful sense of humor and is always game to do something interesting or unconventional -- like, say, taking up with a Yankee girl at Harvard Business School," Whitman wrote.\par \par \uc2 In one oft-told stump speech tale, Whitman jokes about the adventure they set out on when they moved to San Francisco a day after being married in 1980 so Harsh could pursue his neurosurgery residency at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.\par \par \uc2 The choice of San Francisco over Boston, she says, was made after Harsh joked, "Meg, your mother lives in Boston. We're moving to San Francisco."\par \par \uc2 She says they "decamped to the Haight-Ashbury" -- although she writes in her book that the family bought a home on a hill in the tony area above the famous neighborhood. She uses the move for effect, noting the shock from Harsh's Southern family upon visiting San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 While Whitman made sacrifices on behalf of his career -- she has blamed the distractions of her family and her husband's busy career in part for her poor voting record over nearly 30 years -- he and the children also faced trade-offs as Whitman climbed the corporate ladder.\par \par \uc2 Whitman describes in her book asking the family, who enjoy camping and fishing, to wait a few more hours in 1999 for a "long-promised trip" to Yosemite as she had a hurried meeting at the San Jose airport with a would-be employee she wanted to lure to \uc2 eBay\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She writes that as the two talked for several hours, "Griff and the boys kept circling the airport and calling every twenty minutes for an update."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101007e6a70028l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A look at the insults, stumbles and sparring from the debates in this midterm election year:\par \par \uc2 --Connecticut Senate race:\par \par \uc2 "She is different from me. She has spent her life building her fortune. I have spent my life helping people build their futures," Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal said of rival Linda McMahon at a Senate debate Thursday. McMahon, the former head of World Wrestling Entertainment, painted Blumenthal as a career politician who doesn't understand how business works. "I think you want to constantly focus on WWE because it's really difficult for you to focus on the economy and creating jobs," she said.\par \par \uc2 --California governor's race:\par \par \uc2 GOP hopeful Meg Whitman blamed Democrat Jerry Brown for the disclosure that she had employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper. "You put it out there and you should be ashamed for sacrificing Nicky Diaz on the altar of your political ambitions," Whitman told Brown, who was standing a few feet away. He shot back: "You have blamed her, blamed me, blamed the left, blamed the unions. But you don't take accountability."\par \par \uc2 --Nevada governor's race:\par \par \uc2 In a debate Aug. 29, Democrat Rory Reid, son of U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, called Republican rival Brian Sandoval a "nice man" but a "weak leader" who would hurt schools. Sandoval, who was ahead in a recent Las Vegas Review-Journal poll, said Reid was "consistently inaccurate."\par \par \uc2 --Oregon governor's race:\par \par \uc2 The candidates -- Republican Chris Dudley, a former player with the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers, and Democrat John Kitzhaber, a former governor -- spent more time arguing over debates than actually debating. When they finally picked a place and time and a spot to face off, the debate about debates continued: During their sole joint televised appearance in Portland on Sept. 30, Kitzhaber invited Dudley to another Portland debate in October, which Dudley declined. He then asked Kitzhaber to debate him in Medford, to which Kitzhaber has not yet committed.\par \par \uc2 --Arizona governor's race:\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Jan Brewer suffered through a disastrous debate performance in September as she lost her train of thought and endured about 15 seconds of painful silence while discussing her accomplishments as governor. After the debate, she ignored reporters who confronted her about her inaccurate comments that headless bodies were turning up in the Arizona desert. It was the one and only debate between Brewer and Democratic Attorney General Terry Goddard. Brewer has refused to debate again, content to sit on her comfortable double-digit lead in a state where her support of a crackdown on illegal immigration has enhanced her popularity.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101007e6a7001wi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc34}{\*\bkmkend toc34}\b \uc2 Up close and personal, candidates hit each other hard in debates as campaigns race to climax\b0\par\par\uc2 By LIZ SIDOTI   \par \uc2 AP National Political Writer\par \uc2 1,087 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 October 2010\par 15:44\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - "That's a lie. You know that's a lie. I never said it." That was Republican Linda McMahon going after Democrat Richard Blumenthal this week as the Connecticut Senate rivals shared a debate stage. Afterward, he insisted she was the one playing "fast and loose with the facts."\par \par \uc2 Across the country, in California, GOP gubernatorial hopeful Meg Whitman pointedly blamed Democrat Jerry Brown for the disclosure that she had employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper.\par \par \uc2 "You put it out there and you should be ashamed for sacrificing Nicky Diaz on the altar of your political ambitions," Whitman told Brown, who was standing a few feet away. He shot back: "You have blamed her, blamed me, blamed the left, blamed the unions. But you don't take accountability."\par \par \uc2 Candidates have been slinging mud from afar for months, their insults filling TV ads and peppering speeches. Now, in the campaign's final weeks, they're meeting up close in debate -- in many cases for the only time -- and getting right in each other's faces.\par \par \uc2 In the run-up to Nov. 2, dozens of House, Senate and gubernatorial debates are scheduled in hotly contested races in places like Colorado, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Florida, Wisconsin and Illinois.\par \par \uc2 The face-offs can offer some of the only unscripted moments in the campaign. Though much planning goes on behind the scenes to ensure that candidates can satisfactorily answer questions, a debate is the rare time when candidates directly interact with each other and show the voters how they behave under pressure.\par \par \uc2 This close to Election Day, the in-person confrontations can change the trajectory of a race -- or lock it in place. Republicans and Democrats alike say that dramatically altering the course is difficult after a final debate.\par \par \uc2 Those in tight races -- like Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and GOP challenger Sharron Angle -- seek game-changing performances to sway the sliver of still-undecided voters in Nevada. Those with comfortable leads in polling, like Republican Rob Portman in Ohio's Senate race against Democrat Lee Fisher, go into debates hoping to simply avoid stumbling and blowing their advantage.\par \par \uc2 The debates give candidates a forum to explain their positions or backgrounds directly to voters, circumventing the media filter. They get to rebut their foes' claims and level their own criticisms.\par \par \uc2 Images matter just as much as words. How these politicians perform on stage -- from posture to facial expression -- can tell voters much about their character and their poise, and play into campaign narratives.\par \par \uc2 In the 2008 presidential race, Republican John McCain's grimaces sometimes made him look like a grouchy old man next to the younger, polished Democrat Barack Obama. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush's glance at his watch during one debate played into the notion that he was haughty. Both McCain and Bush lost their races.\par \par \uc2 At a debate in the 2000 New York Senate race, Republican Rick Lazio strode across the stage and demanded Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton sign a pledge banning unregulated financial contributions known as "soft money" from her campaign. The confrontation generated sympathy for Clinton while making Lazio look like a menacing bully.\par \par \uc2 Rewards can be sweet for candidates who exceed expectations or who benefit from opponents' poor performances. But risks are enormous, too, particularly in the Internet age. Make a major gaffe, and it can go viral or become fodder for attack ads in the final days.\par \par \uc2 In this year's Alabama gubernatorial race, Democrat Ron Sparks just rolled out an ad showing Republican opponent Robert Bentley during a recent candidate forum saying: "Not every child is going to college and not every child is supposed to go to college." The two had been debating a plan to use state lottery revenue to pay for scholarships.\par \par \uc2 Said Bentley later: "Sometimes in a forum as you are speaking, sometimes things may come out different than the way you want them to come out."\par \par \uc2 Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, in her only debate against Democratic Attorney General Terry Goddard last month, lost her train of thought while discussing her accomplishments and endured about 15 seconds of painful silence. She also was put on the defensive when Goddard challenged her on an incorrect comment that headless bodies were turning up in the Arizona desert.\par \par \uc2 But, even though it was splashed over the Internet, the episode didn't seem to damage her. She has, however, refused to debate Goddard again, content to sit on her double-digit lead in a state that gives her high marks for supporting an illegal immigration crackdown.\par \par \uc2 Florida's trio of Senate candidates lambasted each other Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "You haven't been drinking the Kool-Aid, my friend, you've been drinking too much tea and it's just wrong," Gov. Charlie Crist, who is running as an independent, told Republican Marco Rubio, painting him as a radical conservative beholden to the tea party.\par \par \uc2 Rubio shot back at the Republican-turned-Independent Crist: "I think it's always funny to listen to the governor attack me for the positions he himself held just six months ago." And Democratic Rep. Kendrick Meek piled on: "Charlie Crist stands on a wet paper box. ... You don't know where he is."\par \par \uc2 In Kentucky, tea party-backed Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul and Democrat Jack Conway traded verbal punches and repeatedly interrupted each other on the nationally televised "Fox News Sunday" last weekend.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not saying Dr. Paul is crazy. I think some of his ideas are out of the mainstream, and they're out of touch with the values of normal Kentuckians," said Conway, who is trailing in polls.\par \par \uc2 Sitting on a lead, Paul poked back even though he's largely avoided attacking his rival: "We're waiting for him to catch up a little bit in the polls and then we may refer to him more."\par \par \uc2 Some candidates also still are debating the details of debates, including the number, location and format. In the Oregon governor's race last week, Republican Chris Dudley, a towering former Portland pro basketball player, and Democratic former Gov. John Kitzhaber challenged each other to more debates during their only joint televised appearance. They differed on where to hold another.\par \par \uc2 No word on whether there will be more.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers Phillip Rawls in Montgomery, Ala., and Nigel Duara in Portland, Ore., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101007e6a7001ud\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Republican Meg Whitman's former maid said Tuesday she's not a Democratic pawn in California's race for governor, but her attorney refused again to provide key details about her claims that Whitman employed her for nearly a decade despite knowing she was in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Nicky Diaz Santillan, a Mexican who Whitman says used a fraudulently obtained Social Security card and California driver's license, dismissed claims by the GOP nominee that she was part of a Democratic smear intended to damage Whitman's standing with voters, particularly Latinos.\par \par \uc2 "I make my own decisions and I am not anyone's puppet," Diaz Santillan said in a prepared statement she read at the Los Angeles office of her attorney, Gloria Allred. "Nobody made me do it."\par \par \uc2 Allred, who has longtime Democratic ties and donated money to Brown when he ran for attorney general , has yet to disclose details about how she became involved in the case or disclose who, if anyone, is picking up the bill for her legal work.\par \par \uc2 Allred says Diaz Santillan was referred to her by another lawyer, whom she will not name. Allred didn't answer directly when asked if that lawyer had ties to Whitman's opponent, Democrat Jerry Brown, or his Democratic allies.\par \par \uc2 Allred also sidestepped a question about whether she had any contact with labor unions working to get Brown elected.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not going to play any kind of guessing game," Allred said. When asked about a union link, she said she would need more details before responding.\par \par \uc2 Diaz Santillan has not taken a single question from reporters during three public appearances since last week.\par \par \uc2 The allegations upended the contest last week and forced Whitman to hold an unusual, hour-long news conference in which she answered an array of questions about Diaz Santillan, who cleaned her Silicon Valley home for nine years.\par \par \uc2 Largely at issue is whether Whitman knew about a 2003 letter from the Social Security Administration that raised discrepancies about her housekeeper's documents -- a possible tip-off that she could be in the U.S. illegally. Whitman says she didn't learn about Diaz Santillan's illegal status until told by her maid in June 2009, and she promptly fired her.\par \par \uc2 She has given conflicting answers about the letter: she first said -- repeatedly -- she never received it, then disclosed that her husband might have seen the letter and jotted a note on it telling the housekeeper to "please check this."\par \par \uc2 At a debate in Fresno last week, Whitman accused Brown's campaign of engineering the disclosures and sacrificing the maid "on the altar of your political ambitions." Brown urged Whitman to acknowledge she made a mistake.\par \par \uc2 "You have blamed her, blamed me, blamed the left, blamed the unions. But you don't take accountability," Brown said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Diaz Santillan filed a claim with state regulators saying Whitman owes her $6,200 for time she worked or as reimbursement for mileage while running errands.\par \par \uc2 Whitman spokesman Andrea Jones Rivera said in a statement: "It's time for Gloria Allred to pack-up this circus and leave town." Brown's campaign declined comment.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101005e6a5002zs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Leaked audio in Nevada reveals a Republican Senate candidate trashing her party. Video of a Democratic Senate hopeful wrongly claiming he served in Vietnam becomes a TV ad in Connecticut. A housekeeper steps forward to say her employer, California's GOP gubernatorial nominee, knew she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Digging for dirt, political foes are working overtime to surprise rivals with skeletons and other embarrassments, forcing them to defend themselves rather than focus on their closing arguments in the homestretch of critical midterm elections.\par \par \uc2 Control of Congress and of statehouses nationwide is at stake on Nov. 2, and -- behind the scenes or sometimes in plain sight -- both Republicans seeking power and Democrats looking to retain it are laboring to unearth and highlight stains in opposing candidates' backgrounds. Both sides are using the material to question candidates' character and trustworthiness, important issues with voters who are already sour on politicians in general.\par \par \uc2 In one of the latest episodes, GOP Senate nominee Sharron Angle in Nevada was recorded criticizing Washington Republicans in a conversation with tea party hopeful Scott Ashjian, whose third-party candidacy threatens to siphon votes from her and help Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid win re-election.\par \par \uc2 "The Republicans have lost their standards, they've lost their principles ... really that's why the machine in the Republican Party is fighting against me. They have never really gone along with lower taxes and less government," Angle said, according to a recording that reached the Las Vegas Sun. The newspaper didn't say where it got the recording but Ashjian told MSNBC he taped the meeting by concealing a recorder in his pocket.\par \par \uc2 Reid's campaign used the GOP nominee's comments to claim "Angle will say or do anything to get elected."\par \par \uc2 That incident followed a political bombshell that shook the California governor's race last week.\par \par \uc2 GOP nominee Meg Whitman was forced to answer for employing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for nine years when the Mexican maid -- and her attorney, longtime Democratic supporter Gloria Allred of Los Angeles -- stepped forward to claim that Whitman had known about her status since 2003.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Leaked audio in Nevada reveals a Republican Senate candidate trashing her party. Video of a Democratic Senate hopeful wrongly claiming he served in Vietnam becomes a TV ad in Connecticut. A housekeeper steps forward to say her employer, California's GOP gubernatorial nominee, knew she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Digging for dirt, political foes are working overtime to surprise rivals with skeletons and other embarrassments, forcing them to defend themselves rather than focus on their closing arguments in the homestretch of critical midterm elections.\par \par \uc2 Control of Congress and of statehouses nationwide is at stake on Nov. 2, and -- behind the scenes or sometimes in plain sight -- both Republicans seeking power and Democrats looking to retain it are laboring to unearth and highlight stains in opposing candidates' backgrounds. Both sides are using the material to question candidates' character and trustworthiness, important issues with voters who are already sour on politicians in general.\par \par \uc2 In one of the latest episodes, GOP Senate nominee Sharron Angle in Nevada was recorded criticizing Washington Republicans in a conversation with tea party hopeful Scott Ashjian, whose third-party candidacy threatens to siphon votes from her and help Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid win re-election.\par \par \uc2 "The Republicans have lost their standards, they've lost their principles ... really that's why the machine in the Republican Party is fighting against me. They have never really gone along with lower taxes and less government," Angle said, according to a recording that reached the Las Vegas Sun.\par \par \uc2 Reid's campaign used that to claim "Angle will say or do anything to get elected."\par \par \uc2 That incident followed a political bombshell that shook the California governor's race last week.\par \par \uc2 GOP nominee Meg Whitman was forced to answer for employing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for nine years when the Mexican maid -- and her attorney, longtime Democratic supporter Gloria Allred of Los Angeles -- stepped forward to claim that Whitman had known about her status since 2003. Whitman disputed that and dismissed the allegations as a baseless stunt engineered by Democratic opponent Jerry Brown.\par \par \uc2 "Jerry, you should be ashamed," Whitman told Brown in a weekend debate. "You and your surrogates ... put her deportation at risk. You put it out there and you should be ashamed for sacrificing Nicky Diaz on the altar of your political ambitions."\par \par \uc2 Brown, in turn, accused Whitman of refusing to take responsibility: "You have blamed her, blamed me, blamed the left, blamed the unions. But you don't take accountability."\par \par \uc2 In Connecticut, Republican Linda McMahon rolled out a TV ad on Monday that showed a 2008 clip of Democratic Senate nominee Richard Blumenthal's now-discredited comment about "the days that I served in Vietnam." The controversy surfaced in the spring, putting a chink in the Democrat's campaign in what some strategists called the opening salvo in the opposition-research wars. The ad takes it to the next level, asking: "If he lied about Vietnam, what else is he lying about?"\par \par \uc2 McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment executive, also is finding herself the target of an unflattering disclosure: media reports of a contract involving her wrestling empire teaming with the company that produces the "Girls Gone Wild" videos and promoting a 2003 "uncensored" pay-per-view spring break special.\par \par \uc2 There's almost surely more to come.\par \par \uc2 "Some of these stories, if they check out and if they get legs they can really affect how people vote. In close races, opposition research can make a difference," said Mike Gehrke, who spent several election cycles as a Democratic opposition researcher.\par \par \uc2 But opposition research can backfire of simply fall flat.\par \par \uc2 "There are so many different channels for it now -- TV ads, web videos, e-mail, blogs, radio, direct mail. The message can become so fractured that people tune it out," said Kevin Madden, a Republican communications operative. "It has to be potent."\par \par \uc2 Political operatives on both sides compile reams of information on candidates' personal backgrounds and professional records. Divorce files and housing documents are mined. Video appearances and audio recordings are collected. Rumors of wrongdoing are chased down.\par \par \uc2 Politically damaging disclosures eventually are leaked by allies to local media outlets or posted without fingerprints on the Internet, giving candidates plausible deniability so voters don't hold them accountable for negative campaigning. In many cases, the information finds its way into TV ads in a campaign's final weeks.\par \par \uc2 Timing is important: Plant information too early and voters may forget about it, too late and they may not learn about it before heading to the polls.\par \par \uc2 And so, with four weeks until Election Day, the disclosures and allegations pile higher.\par \par \uc2 House Democrats are contending that eight Republican hopefuls around the country "with disturbing backgrounds and legal problems" were recruited and endorsed by House GOP leaders.

On Monday, Britain, Japan and Sweden issued warnings of their own, advising their citizens traveling in Europe to be on alert for possible terrorist attack by al-Qaida or other groups.\par \par \uc2 Police officers with sniffer dogs patrolled subways in Britain on Monday, while soldiers and mounted police were dispatched to two major churches in Paris -- Notre Dame in the heart of the city and Sacre Coeur on the Right Bank. Paramilitary troops were also seen patrolling the area around the Eiffel Tower -- twice evacuated in recent weeks for unspecified threats.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Test-tube baby pioneer Robert Edwards of Britain wins 2010 Nobel Prize in medicine\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nobel Prize in medicine went to a man whose work led to the first test tube baby, an achievement that helped bring 4 million infants into the world and raised challenging new questions about human reproduction.\par \par \uc2 Robert Edwards of Britain, now an 85-year-old professor emeritus at the University of Cambridge, lived to see the far-reaching ramifications of his hugely controversial early research.\par \par \uc2 "Today, Robert Edwards' vision is a reality and brings joy to infertile people all over the world," the Nobel Committee said in Stockholm. It began with the birth on July 25, 1978, of the first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, to a couple who had been trying to conceive for nine years.\par \par \uc2 With in vitro fertilization, or IVF, an egg is removed from a woman, mixed with sperm in a laboratory, allowed to divide for four or five days, then implanted in the womb to grow into a baby. Today the odds of a couple having a baby after a single cycle of IVF treatment are about 1 in 5, roughly the same odds as a fertile couple trying to have children naturally.\par \par \uc2 Edwards and research partner Patrick Steptoe, who died in 1988, faced opposition to their IVF experiments.

(AP) -- After the governor began raiding the state's electronic bingo halls, casino owners sent lobbyists to the Capitol with orders to make their Vegas-style parlors legal. Part of the plan, federal authorities said Monday, was to offer lawmakers millions of dollars in bribes.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department unveiled an indictment accusing the owner of Alabama's largest casino, four state senators and several lobbyists of a scheme to buy and sell votes in the Legislature. One defendant has pleaded guilty to offering a senator $2 million to vote for a bill to keep the bingo machines operating.\par \par \uc2 Since Republican Gov. Bob Riley began his raids nearly two years ago, the issue has set off angry statehouse rallies and complaints by local officials that casino closures cost poor counties much-needed jobs. Against this backdrop and with the pro-gambling bill on the verge of passage, the Justice Department announced last spring that it was looking into corruption at the statehouse.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, federal agents spread out across the state to arrest 11 people on federal charges of conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud.\par \par \uc2 The head of the Justice Department's criminal division, Lanny Breuer, said the corrupt scheming was "astonishing in scope ... a full-scale campaign to bribe legislators and others."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Obama's ex-chief of staff Rahm Emanuel hits Chicago streets to make his case for mayor\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) -- Last week, Afghanistan.

Yet researchers report a key step for the first gene test aimed at reducing unnecessary angiograms -- expensive and somewhat risky procedures that hundreds of thousands of Americans have each year to check for clogged arteries. Most of these exams, done in hospital cardiac catheterization labs, turn out negative.\par \par \uc2 A simple blood test to show who truly needs an angiogram would help, and 6,000 people have had the gene test since it went on sale last year. It has drawbacks. It suggests too many chronic chest pain sufferers have heart disease when they really don't, and misses it in others who do.\par \par \uc2 Several heart experts say they need to see better results before they'd use it. But similar tests are used now to guide breast cancer treatment and organ transplants, and many doctors think they'll eventually prove valuable for heart disease as more genes are discovered that affect risk.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, an American Heart Association journal will publish details of a big international effort by scientists to pool information and find more of these genes.\par \par \uc2 "This could ultimately really help to reduce unnecessary angiograms," \uc2 Dr. Eric Topol\uc2 , of \uc2 Scripps Health\uc2  in La Jolla, Calif., said of the test.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Mets fire manager Jerry Manuel and general manager Omar Minaya\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets fired manager Jerry Manuel and general manager Omar Minaya on Monday, an expected shake-up of the big-spending ballclub after its second straight losing season.

(AP) -- After the governor began raiding the state's electronic bingo halls, casino owners sent lobbyists to the Capitol with orders to make their Vegas-style parlors legal. Part of the plan, federal authorities said Monday, was to offer lawmakers millions of dollars in bribes. The Justice Department unveiled an indictment accusing the owners of two of Alabama's largest casinos, four state senators and several lobbyists of a scheme to buy and sell votes in the Legislature. One defendant has pleaded guilty to offering a senator $2 million to vote for a bill to keep the bingo machines operating.\par \par \uc2 Gene test aims for better heart disease detection\par \par \uc2 It's not a perfect test. Yet researchers report a key step for the first gene test aimed at reducing unnecessary angiograms -- expensive and somewhat risky procedures that hundreds of thousands of Americans have each year to check for clogged arteries. Most of these exams, done in hospital cardiac catheterization labs, turn out negative. A simple blood test to show who truly needs an angiogram would help, and 6,000 people have had the gene test since it went on sale last year. It has drawbacks. It suggests too many chronic chest pain sufferers have heart disease when they really don't, and misses it in others who do.\par \par \uc2 Fla. man denies cocaine found in buttocks is his\par \par \uc2 BRADENTON, Fla.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) - One night two summers ago, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico brawled with a gang of white teens from Shenandoah, an old mining town in the coal fields of northeastern Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 The fight's outcome is not in dispute: 25-year-old Luis Ramirez wound up dead. The question for a jury is did two former high school football stars commit a federal hate crime.\par \par \uc2 Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak are charged in connection with the attack -- a case brought by the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division after an all-white jury acquitted the defendants of state charges last year.\par \par \uc2 Jury selection begins Monday at the courthouse in Scranton.\par \par \uc2 A guilty verdict in the high-profile trial could send Piekarsky, now 18, and Donchak, now 20, to prison for life, as well as soothe the anger felt by Ramirez's supporters after the May 2009 verdict in Schuylkill County Court. Piekarsky was cleared of third-degree murder and ethnic intimidation; Donchak beat aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation charges. Both were convicted of simple assault.\par \par \uc2 A separate indictment charges Shenandoah's former police chief and two officers with sabotaging the investigation into Ramirez's death by altering evidence and lying to the FBI. They are scheduled to go on trial early next year.\par \par \uc2 Gladys Limon, an attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said the trial this week represents a new chance to hold the perpetrators accountable.\par \par \uc2 "More than two years after this brutal beating, the family and the public will for the first time have the opportunity for justice," said Limon, who has followed the case closely and accompanied the American mother of Ramirez's children to the first trial. "We know the state prosecution resulted in a complete miscarriage of justice."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors are expected to portray Ramirez as the victim of drunken thugs motivated by their dislike of the town's growing Hispanic population. They say Piekarsky and Donchak shouted obscenity-laced ethnic slurs at Ramirez during the brawl, telling him to "Go back to Mexico" and "Tell your (expletive) Mexican friends to get the (expletive) out of Shenandoah."\par \par \uc2 The defendants claim that Ramirez's ethnicity had nothing to do with the melee, that he was the aggressor, and that the federal prosecution is politically motivated.\par \par \uc2 Both defendants are charged under criminal provisions of the Fair Housing Act.\par \par \uc2 The government's theory -- that Piekarsky and Donchak attacked Ramirez because of his ethnicity, and wanted him and other Latinos to leave Shenandoah -- is "just completely not only false, but ridiculous," said William Fetterhoff, Donchak's lawyer. "These kids, none of them, had any intention to target a person of Mexican background that night."\par \par \uc2 Fetterhoff said the fact that ethnic slurs were hurled at Ramirez during the melee proves only that "when a fight begins among teenage boys, the sky is the limit for name-calling and crass language."\par \par \uc2 The confrontation began late on July 12, 2008, when a half-dozen teens were headed home from a block party in Shenandoah and began arguing with Ramirez, who was with his 15-year-old girlfriend in a park. The verbal altercation escalated into a brawl, with punches thrown on both sides.\par \par \uc2 Piekarsky was accused of delivering a fatal kick to Ramirez's head after he'd already been knocked unconscious by another teen, Colin Walsh, who pleaded guilty in federal court last year to violating Ramirez's civil rights and testified against his one-time friends at the state trial.\par \par \uc2 Donchak also took part in the fight and then conspired with Shenandoah police to cover up the crime, federal prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez's death exposed simmering ethnic tensions in Shenandoah, a blue-collar town of 5,000 about 80 miles northwest of Philadelphia that attracted Hispanics drawn by jobs in factories and farm fields.\par \par \uc2 Some Latinos say they continue to feel unwelcome in the town.\par \par \uc2 "We talk about this in the restaurant every weekend," said Fermin Bermejo, who runs a restaurant called Boricua House that draws a mix of whites and Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the people in the town are great, wonderful people. The problem starts with anybody who has some kind of power: law enforcement, borough council, our mayor, our school board," said Bermejo, a Puerto Rican born in the United States. "There's a pattern, not only for myself but for many Latino people who come in here and say, 'I don't think it's fair. I don't like what's happening.' It's been like that a long time. But I believe it's going to continue to change for the better."\par \par \uc2 Court documents filed in advance of the hate-crimes trial provide a glimpse into the hot-button issues surrounding the case.\par \par \uc2 The defense objects to several questions that prosecutors want to ask potential jurors, claiming the government is trying to keep white conservatives off the panel.\par \par \uc2 "The Government has attempted to politicize this case from the beginning, and its proposed (jury) questionnaire is but a further attempt to do so," defense lawyers wrote. "The premise for the Government's questions on political philosophy is obvious. The Government deems white, rural conservatives as likely bigots unable to apply the law and follow the Court's instructions in this case."\par \par \uc2 The government, for its part, has asked U.S. District Judge A. Richard Caputo to forbid the defense from telling jurors that Piekarsky and Donchak have already been tried and acquitted in state court, fearing an attempt to encourage "jury nullification" or confuse jurors about double jeopardy, which doesn't apply in this case.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors also don't want defense attorneys to call them "Washington, D.C.," or "out-of-town" lawyers or suggest the charges are politically motivated.\par \par \uc2 And they have asked Caputo to forbid the defense from raising questions about Ramirez's character, including his immigration status, his romantic relationship with an underage girl, and allegations that he sold illegal drugs and used an alias.\par \par \uc2 Both defendants are free pending the outcome of the trial. Donchak won the court's permission to accompany his family on at least three camping trips this summer, while Piekarsky spent a week in Ocean City, Md., with friends.\par \par \uc2 Piekarsky's lawyer, James Swetz, said his client is anxious to get started.\par \par \uc2 "He's looking to put this behind him so he can get on with his life," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101003e6a3001ws\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - GOP gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman and Democratic rival Jerry Brown traded barbs over immigration policy and Whitman's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper during a heated debate that was aimed at California's growing Latino population.\par \par \uc2 Both candidates hoped to score points with the crucial voting bloc during Saturday's face-off, the first to air statewide on Spanish-language television. Whitman acknowledged early on that she cannot win the governor's race without Latino votes.\par \par \uc2 Whitman had planned to use the debate at California State University, Fresno to move on from a controversy that has dominated headlines this week after it was revealed she had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper for nine years.\par \par \uc2 The billionaire former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive, who has spent $119 million of her own money on the race, tried instead to focus on her campaign themes of creating jobs and improving the state's public school system.\par \par \uc2 But with so much attention on issues related to immigration policy, Whitman was forced to explain her conservative positions while Brown had many opportunities to bring up the housekeeper.\par \par \uc2 When the debate moderator asked Whitman about her treatment of the worker, she accused Brown's campaign of orchestrating the controversy and sacrificing the maid "on the altar of your political ambitions." Brown fired back that Whitman has not taken responsibility and is not fit to be governor.\par \par \uc2 "Don't run for governor if you can't stand up on your own two feet and say, 'Hey I made a mistake,'" Brown said in a moment fraught with tension as the two candidates, neck-and-neck in the polls, turned away from the audience and faced each other directly. "You have blamed her, blamed me, blamed the left, blamed the unions. But you don't take accountability."\par \par \uc2 Whitman's campaign has worked hard to win support among independents and Latinos, who are crucial to the campaign of any Republican running in a state in which Democrats hold a 13.4 percentage point edge among registered voters.\par \par \uc2 But Democrats hope to exploit the housekeeper controversy as a way to question Whitman's character. Whitman fired the woman in June 2009, immediately after she said she found out the housekeeper was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 She then refused to help when the woman asked for help pursuing legal residency. Whitman said the decision was the right one at the time.\par \par \uc2 She said she had no reason to believe the housekeeper, Nicky Diaz Santillan, was illegal, and had to act within the law.\par \par \uc2 "We hired Nicky because she had all the appropriate documents, we went through a hiring agency, and then in June of 2009 she came to me to tell me that she was here illegally and did not have the appropriate documents," she said. "I made the hardest decision I have almost made in my life, which was to let her go. ... So it broke my heart. It was incredibly difficult for me to do."\par \par \uc2 Brown said it was shabby for Whitman not to offer at least initial help to the housekeeper, whom Whitman has described as being like a member of her extended family.\par \par \uc2 "When someone works with you, you do have familial bonds and ties, and I think if that story is to be believed, I think Meg flunked the most fundamental test of all, and that is to treat people with respect and decency," he told reporters in a post-debate news conference.\par \par \uc2 Whitman also is addressing allegations from the housekeeper's attorney that she and her husband, a Stanford neurosurgeon, should have suspected the worker's status because of a Social Security Administration letter mailed to their home in 2003.\par \par \uc2 Gloria Allred, the housekeeper's attorney, is a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates. Whitman told reporters after the debate the controversy is a sideshow from the issues Californians want to focus on, such as jobs and education.\par \par \uc2 Brown and Whitman had several lengthy exchanges over high-profile immigration issues, including whether illegal immigrants already in the country should be able to seek citizenship and whether the government should crack down on employers who hire illegal workers. They also sparred over the DREAM Act, which would let U.S. high school graduates who were brought into the country illegally as children become legal residents after spending two years in college or the military.\par \par \uc2 "We need a better e-verify system, three strikes and you're out, you get fined, you lose your business license," Whitman said about her belief that employers need to be targeted. "If we do not hold employers accountable, we will never get our arms around this very challenging problem,"\par \par \uc2 Brown pounced.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Whitman obviously didn't crack down on herself," he said. "This is a question of talking out of both sides of her mouth."\par \par \uc2 The candidates also faced a question about the DREAM Act from a woman who said she was a senior at the university and was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Without a pathway to citizenship, she won't be able to work legally after graduation, even though she was at the top of her class when she graduated from a California high school. Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a state DREAM Act bill just days ago.\par \par \uc2 Brown said he would sign the law if it came to him as governor. Whitman opposes it.\par \par \uc2 "She wants to kick you out of the school because you are not documented, and that is wrong -- morally and humanly," he told the woman.\par \par \uc2 Whitman said California citizens should have first crack at California's overcrowded colleges, which are under financial strain because of budget cuts.\par \par \uc2 "This is a very tough situation, but I don't think it's fair to the people who are here in California legally," she said. "I don't think we can carve out a group of illegal immigrants and get them a path to citizenship when we haven't sorted out control of our borders and getting our arms around illegal immigration."\par \par \uc2 Whitman reiterated her opposition to a path to citizenship and tried to shift blame for immigration problems to the federal government, saying the first priority should be securing the border with Mexico. Brown said he would treat all Californians equally "as God's children."\par \par \uc2 "You don't just bring in semi-serfs and say do our dirty work, and then we're finished with you like an orange and just throw it away. That's after you've squeezed it. That's not right," he said.\par \par \uc2 Whitman said later that her messages of job creation and improving K-12 schools are resonating with Latino voters, and she'll continue to focus on that.\par \par \uc2 "Without jobs, there is no future. Without keeping California's businesses here, there is no future," she said. "Every Latino family that I have run into says if we do not fix our education system there is no way forward, and so I am deeply committed to education."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers Garance Burke and Samantha Young contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101003e6a30010g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Much of Saturday's gubernatorial debate between Republican Meg Whitman and Democrat Jerry Brown centered on this week's controversy over Whitman's acknowledgment that she had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper on the payroll for nine years and, according to her, didn't know it. She said she fired the housekeeper in June 2009 immediately after being told she was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The attorney for the housekeeper, Nicky Diaz Santillan, produced a 2003 letter from the Social Security Administration mailed to the Whitman household that said the Social Security number she provided did not match the name on file. At the bottom of the letter was a handwritten note that appeared to be from Whitman's husband to Diaz, suggesting at least he saw the letter.\par \par \uc2 Here are some of their comments on the matter:\par \par \uc2 Whitman:\par \par \uc2 -- "Here's the truth, here's the real story of what happened. We hired Nicky because she had all the appropriate documents. We went through a hiring agency, and then in June of 2009 she came to me to tell me that she was here illegally and did not have the appropriate documents. I made the hardest decision I have almost made in my life, which was to let her go. And my lawyer said to me there is not much you can do for Nicky; she forged documents, she um, was here illegally."\par \par \uc2 --"The real tragedy here is Nicky. After Nov. 2, no one's going to be watching out for Nicky Diaz. And Jerry, you know you should be ashamed, you and your surrogates ... put her deportation at risk. You put it out there and you should be ashamed for sacrificing Nicky Diaz on the altar of your political ambitions."\par \par \uc2 -- "He's just dead wrong. I was accountable for hiring someone I believed to be a documented worker. She became a part of our family and when it turned out she came to me and was undocumented, I did what the law requires and I had to let it go. It broke my heart because Nicky had become a part of our family, but it was the right thing to do."\par \par \uc2 -- "What Jerry Brown is not accountable for is the role that he has played in this whole political circus. He does not acknowledge that uh, he's very close to Gloria Allred, he does not acknowledge that his campaign was moving this around two weeks ago, he does not acknowledge that the Service Employees International Union -- SEIU -- was all poised and ready to go with an ad. ... (Nicky) is in deep trouble now because she's been brought forward as forging documents, and you know, I don't know what is going to happen to Nicky and I worry about her tremendously."\par \par \uc2 Brown:\par \par \uc2 -- "This is incredible, when you try to evade responsibility. You're going around this state saying employers must be accountable for hiring unlawful people, there ought to be raids on businesses, there's no path to citizenship, no path, and young Latinos who may have lived here their whole lives and got A's in high school should be barred from going to Fresno State."\par \par \uc2 -- "You're the one who falsely defamed this woman by saying she stole your mail, and it came out it's not true and you had information, or at least you had enough to know there's something wrong here. So you're the one who says 'Hey everyone's got to be accountable. This is a terrible thing: We have all these millions of (illegal) people, but you don't want a path to citizenship."\par \par \uc2 -- "You have blamed her, blamed me, blamed the left, blamed the unions, but you don't take accountability and you can't be a leader unless you're willing to stand on your own two feet and say, 'Yep, I made a mistake.'"\par \par \uc2 -- "It's not just about cost-benefit, about tax breaks, about competition, we're also human beings. When someone works with you, you do have familial bonds and ties and I think if that story is to be believed, I think Meg flunked the most fundamental test of all, and that is to treat people with respect and decency."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers Garance Burke, Juliet Williams and Samantha Young contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101002e6a20028k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Much of Saturday's gubernatorial debate between Republican Meg Whitman and Democrat Jerry Brown centered on this week's controversy over Whitman's acknowledgment that she had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper on the payroll for nine years and, according to her, didn't know it. She said she fired the housekeeper in June 2009 immediately after being told she was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The attorney for the housekeeper, Nicky Diaz Santillan, produced a 2003 letter from the Social Security Administration mailed to the Whitman household that said the Social Security number she provided did not match the name on file. At the bottom of the letter was a handwritten note that appeared to be from Whitman's husband to Diaz, suggesting at least he saw the letter.\par \par \uc2 Here are some of their comments on the matter:\par \par \uc2 Whitman:\par \par \uc2 -- "Here's the truth, here's the real story of what happened. We hired Nicky because she had all the appropriate documents. We went through a hiring agency, and then in June of 2009 she came to me to tell me that she was here illegally and did not have the appropriate documents. I made the hardest decision I have almost made in my life, which was to let her go. And my lawyer said to me there is not much you can do for Nicky; she forged documents, she um, was here illegally."\par \par \uc2 --"The real tragedy here is Nicky. After Nov. 2, no one's going to be watching out for Nicky Diaz. And Jerry, you know you should be ashamed, you and your surrogates ... put her deportation at risk. You put it out there and you should be ashamed for sacrificing Nicky Diaz on the altar of your political ambitions."\par \par \uc2 -- "He's just dead wrong. I was accountable for hiring someone I believed to be a documented worker. She became a part of our family and when it turned out she came to me and was undocumented, I did what the law requires and I had to let it go. It broke my heart because Nicky had become a part of our family, but it was the right thing to do."\par \par \uc2 -- "What Jerry Brown is not accountable for is the role that he has played in this whole political circus. He does not acknowledge that uh, he's very close to Gloria Allred, he does not acknowledge that his campaign was moving this around two weeks ago, he does not acknowledge that the Service Employees International Union -- SEIU -- was all poised and ready to go with an ad. ... (Nicky) is in deep trouble now because she's been brought forward as forging documents, and you know, I don't know what is going to happen to Nicky and I worry about her tremendously."\par \par \uc2 Brown:\par \par \uc2 -- "This is incredible, when you try to evade responsibility. You're going around this state saying employers must be accountable for hiring unlawful people, there ought to be raids on businesses, there's no path to citizenship, no path, and young Latinos who may have lived here their whole lives and got A's in high school should be barred from going to Fresno State."\par \par \uc2 -- "You're the one who falsely defamed this woman by saying she stole your mail, and it came out it's not true and you had information, or at least you had enough to know there's something wrong here. So you're the one who says 'Hey everyone's got to be accountable. This is a terrible thing: We have all these millions of (illegal) people, but you don't want a path to citizenship."\par \par \uc2 -- "You have blamed her, blamed me, blamed the left, blamed the unions, but you don't take accountability and you can't be a leader unless you're willing to stand on your own two feet and say 'Yep, I made a mistake.'"\par \par \uc2 -- "It's not just about cost-benefit, about tax breaks, about competition, we're also human beings. When someone works with you, you do have familial bonds and ties and I think if that story is to be believed, I think Meg flunked the most fundamental test of all, and that is to treat people with respect and decency."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers Garance Burke, Juliet Williams and Samantha Young contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101002e6a200284\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - GOP gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman accused Democratic rival Jerry Brown on Saturday of orchestrating a scandal over her former \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper, a charge that prompted Brown to fire back and say Whitman won't take responsibility and is not fit to be governor.\par \par \uc2 The issue dominated the candidates' second debate, held in one of the most economically distressed regions of the state, after a week that has upended Whitman's campaign.\par \par \uc2 "The real tragedy here is Nicky. After Nov. 2, no one's going to be watching out for Nicky Diaz," Whitman said, referring to the former housekeeper, and turning to face Brown directly shortly after the start of their second debate. "And Jerry, you know you should be ashamed, you and your surrogates ... put her deportation at risk. You put it out there and you should be ashamed for sacrificing Nicky Diaz on the altar of your political ambitions."\par \par \uc2 Brown responded by saying Whitman, the billionaire former chief executive of \uc2 eBay\uc2 , was trying to evade responsibility.\par \par \uc2 "Don't run for governor if you can't stand up on your own two feet and say, 'Hey I made a mistake,'" Brown said in a moment fraught with tension as the two candidates, neck-and-neck in the polls, turned away from the audience and faced each other directly. "You have blamed her, blamed me, blamed the left, blamed the unions. But you don't take accountability."\par \par \uc2 Whitman had hoped to use the debate at California State University, Fresno to court Latino voters. She has worked hard to win support among independents and Latinos, who are crucial to the campaign of any Republican running in a state in which Democrats hold a 13.4 percentage point edge among registered voters.\par \par \uc2 But she's been forced to explain how she had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper -- Nicky Diaz Santillan -- on the payroll for nine years and, according to her, didn't know it.\par \par \uc2 Whitman also is addressing allegations from the housekeeper's attorney that she and her husband should have suspected the worker's status because of a Social Security Administration letter mailed to their home in 2003.\par \par \uc2 Gloria Allred, the housekeeper's attorney, is a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates. Whitman told reporters after the debate the controversy is a sideshow from the issues Californians want to focus on, such as jobs and education.\par \par \uc2 But immigration issues dominated the event, which was sponsored by Univision and was the first California gubernatorial debate to be broadcast in Spanish. The pressure erupted as the candidates took their fourth question, after the candidates faced questions about jobs, public education and the housing crisis.\par \par \uc2 "So, this is a very sad situation, and the Nicky that I saw on the press conference a few days ago was not the Nicky that I knew for nine years," Whitman said as she began to address the issue that has thrown her campaign off track. "And you know what my first clue was? She kept referring to me as Ms. Whitman. And for the 10 years, nine years she worked for me, she called me Meg and I called her Nicky."\par \par \uc2 After technical problems forced a delay, Brown and Whitman had several lengthy exchanges over high-profile immigration issues, including whether illegal immigrants already in the country should be able to seek citizenship; the DREAM Act that would let U.S. high school graduates who were brought into the country illegally as children become legal U.S. residents after spending two years in college or the military; and cracking down on employers who hire illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 "If we don't hold employers accountable, we will never get our arms around this ... problem," Whitman said during the debate.\par \par \uc2 Brown pounced.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Whitman obviously didn't crack down on herself," he said. "This is a question of talking out of both sides of her mouth."\par \par \uc2 Whitman says that after she learned her maid was illegal, she did not turn her in to immigration authorities. She also rejected her maid's request to help her pursue citizenship, even though she has said the housekeeper was like a member of her extended family.\par \par \uc2 "You're going around this state saying employers must be accountable for hiring unlawful people, there ought to be raids on businesses, there's no path to citizenship," Brown said. "This a terrible thing we have -- all these millions of (illegal) people, but you don't want a path to citizenship."\par \par \uc2 The candidates also faced a question about the DREAM Act from a woman who said she was a senior at the university and an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Without a pathway to citizenship, she won't be able to work legally after graduation, even though she was at the top of her class when she graduated from a California high school. Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a state DREAM Act bill last week.\par \par \uc2 Brown said he would sign the law if it came to him as governor. Whitman opposes it.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Whitman goes beyond opposing the Dream Act: She wants to kick you out of this school because you are not documented and that is wrong," Brown said.\par \par \uc2 Whitman said California citizens should have first crack at California's overcrowded colleges, which are under financial strain because of budget cuts.\par \par \uc2 "This is a very tough situation, but I don't think it's fair to the people who are here in California legally," she said.\par \par \uc2 Whitman reiterated her opposition to a path to citizenship and tried to shift blame for immigration problems to the federal government, saying the first priority should be securing the border with Mexico. Brown said he would treat all Californians equally "as God's children."\par \par \uc2 "You don't just bring in semi-serfs and say do our dirty work, and then we're finished with you like an orange and just throw it away. That's after you've squeezed it. That's not right," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers Garance Burke and Samantha Young contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101002e6a20013d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - The airwaves in California have been dominated by images of a teary immigrant housekeeper claiming she was mistreated by her billionaire employer and turned away when she asked for citizenship help.\par \par \uc2 It's far from the message Republican Meg Whitman wants to send to the state's crucial Latino voting bloc as she runs for governor.\par \par \uc2 Whitman is accused of knowingly having the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper from Mexico on her payroll for several years in a revelation that has throttled her campaign just as she prepares for a Spanish-language debate Saturday against Democratic opponent Jerry Brown. She needs Latino voters to win in Democratic-leaning California.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has sought to cast the story in a positive way -- careful not to demonize the housekeeper while calling her an extended member of the family. Whitman noted how she and her husband paid her the usual $23-an-hour fee even when they were away on vacation and said the woman is being manipulated by Democratic operatives connected to the campaign of Brown.\par \par \uc2 Even so, the image of a tough-on-immigration gubernatorial candidate getting ensnared in a messy controversy over the legality of her household help is not helpful to a Republican trying to attract the Hispanic vote.\par \par \uc2 The narrative of a Hispanic maid feeling she was mistreated by her wealthy employer is a personal one for many in the Hispanic community, and such a scenario playing out in a campaign could hurt Whitman, some experts say.\par \par \uc2 "The message she sent is a distant, patronizing figure who is willing to use immigrants but doesn't understand their plight," said Louis DeSipio, chairman of Chicano-Latino Studies at the University of California, Irvine. "To the extent Meg Whitman did reach out to Latinos, she's probably lost that initiative."\par \par \uc2 Whitman addressed the controversy head-on during a news conference Thursday in Santa Monica and will get another chance Saturday when she and Brown meet in their second debate in Fresno. This one is sponsored by Univision and is targeted toward a Hispanic audience.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the controversy also could risk Whitman's support among two other key voting blocs: independent voters, who comprise about 20 percent of the electorate, and conservatives, who might question why Whitman didn't report her housekeeper to federal immigration authorities when she acknowledged being in the country illegally in June 2009.\par \par \uc2 Nancy Bolanos, a 31-year-old medical biller in Fresno, is a registered Democrat who said and she's getting annoyed by the governor's race because it's getting "dirty." She said Whitman's stance on immigration has turned her off on the candidate.\par \par \uc2 "I was leaning towards Meg Whitman until the whole immigration thing came on," Bolanos said.\par \par \uc2 Katia Castro, who immigrated from Costa Rica 20 years ago, said while she liked Whitman's image overall, she found the revelation about her housekeeper "disgusting."\par \par \uc2 "Me being a Latina and an immigrant, I guess I'm biased," said Castro, 45, a registered Democrat from Fresno. "But if she was against illegal immigration and she had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  working for her, that's hypocritical."\par \par \uc2 The allegations have dominated the governor's race since Nicky Diaz Santillan came forward this week with accusations that Whitman and her husband should have known for years she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Whitman said she only realized the worker was illegal last year -- and she promptly fired her.\par \par \uc2 Her attorney, Gloria Allred of Los Angeles, said she will file a claim against Whitman for unpaid back wages and mileage. Whitman says she will vigorously defend against any such claim.\par \par \uc2 At the heart of the controversy is a 2003 document from the Social Security Administration alerting the Whitman household to discrepancies with the maid's Social Security number, saying it did not match the name on file. Allred produced the letter with what appeared to be handwriting from Whitman's husband, a Stanford neurosurgeon, suggesting that at least he was tipped off to questions about Diaz Santillan's status.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has responded with compassion for her former maid, whom she described as an extended member of her family, while also trying to preserve her campaign pledge to be tough on immigration enforcement. The former chief executive of \uc2 eBay\uc2  says it broke her heart when she fired her maid, she was obligated to do so under federal law.\par \par \uc2 When asked why she didn't offer to help the woman, Whitman said she felt she had to do what was right at the time. She said it would be up to federal immigration authorities to decide whether to start deportation proceedings against Diaz Santillan. Whitman's campaign said Diaz Santillan acknowledged using some of her sister's records when she signed an immigration document and submitted a driver's license and Social Security card.\par \par \uc2 Hispanics are a growing part of California's population, accounting for roughly 37 percent of the state's 38.6 million people. While many are not U.S. citizens or have never registered to vote, Hispanics are projected to make up 15 percent of voters in the Nov. 2 general election, according to a recent Field Poll.\par \par \uc2 A growing number of those voters are relatively new naturalized citizens who don't have any allegiance to a political party, representing a key opportunity for the Republican Party, said Harry Pachon, president of The Tomas Rivera Policy Institute at the University of Southern California.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has aggressively courted Hispanics with Spanish-language radio and television ads, including spots during 15 games of the World Cup. She opened offices in the predominantly Hispanic areas, and has held a number of campaign events with Hispanic leaders.\par \par \uc2 Much of her outreach has focused on job-creation and improving public schools, top issues in the Hispanic community that up until now have overshadowed her views on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has said she does not favor a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million people estimated to be in the country illegally. Instead, she advocates for tighter border security and an expanded guest-worker program.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has tried to refocus the campaign since the controversy erupted on Wednesday, saying voters care more about the state's high unemployment rate and failing schools. She also has sought to divert negative attention to Brown, whom she accused of being behind efforts to manipulate her former housekeeper.\par \par \uc2 Allred, the attorney, is a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates.\par \par \uc2 "I think Latinos are really smart," Whitman told reporters Thursday. "I think they will see this for exactly what it is, which is one giant political stunt and smear campaign by a desperate Brown campaign. Thirty days out, this is so obvious what is going on."\par \par \uc2 The Brown campaign and his labor-backed allies have denied any involvement.\par \par \uc2 In an effort at damage control, Whitman's campaign launched an immediate response to counter Diaz Santillan's allegations, dispatching Spanish-speaking surrogates to explain Whitman's side of the story. One of their key points: Diaz Santillan was hardly mistreated when she worked just 15 hours a week for the Whitman family and was paid $23 an hour.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the discussion now is what is going to happen to this woman and her family," said Whitman Spanish media spokesman Hector Barajas. "Is she being used? Did they force her, knowing she was undocumented, to testify?"\par \par \uc2 One of the state's largest public employee unions intends to keep the incident fresh in voters' minds as part of a $5 million Spanish-language media campaign starting Saturday. It accuses Whitman of saying one thing in her Spanish-language campaign ads and another when she speaks in English.\par \par \uc2 "I think they're going to see what's happened to their grandmothers, their mothers, their sisters," Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, said of Latino voters. "They get hired by rich people, get exploited and they put up with it in the hope that it will lead to help legalizing their status. Finally, when they ask for help, they find themselves fired and put on the street."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Garance Burke contributed to this report from Fresno.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101002e6a20002b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - She is the mystery in the middle of the California governor's race.\par \par \uc2 Three days ago, Republican Meg Whitman's former housekeeper accused her of knowing for years she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  but kept her on the payroll anyway -- an allegation that upended the campaign and left Whitman struggling to steady her candidacy just weeks before election day.\par \par \uc2 Nicky Diaz Santillan, a 39-year-old mother of three, hasn't spoken a word in public since and left a trail of questions about her story and how she ended up as the client of a high-powered Los Angeles lawyer with longtime Democratic ties, Gloria Allred.\par \par \uc2 Under Allred's guidance, Diaz Santillan hasn't answered a single question from reporters since that day. No one answered the door Wednesday at an address listed for Diaz Santillan in a well-kept middle-class neighborhood in Union City, a San Francisco suburb.\par \par \uc2 A phone number listed for the family has been disconnected.\par \par \uc2 Allred has said little about Diaz Santillan's whereabouts or thinking from the time she was fired by Whitman in June 2009 until she appeared at Allred's side at her Los Angeles law office. Allred says the case was referred to her by another lawyer, but will not reveal that person's name.\par \par \uc2 "Nicky spent a great deal of time deliberating as to whether or not she could, would or should do or say anything," Allred told reporters. "Finally ... she decided, yes, she should do something. ... She decided to talk to an attorney."\par \par \uc2 Whitman has accused her Democratic opponent, Jerry Brown, of orchestrating a "smear attack" on her candidacy. Allred says she has no connection to Brown's campaign, though she has donated money to him in the past.\par \par \uc2 Whitman says Diaz Santillan provided a valid but fraudulently obtained Social Security card and driver's license when she was hired through an employment agency in 2000, and denies she knew about her illegal status until told by Diaz Santillan in June 2009.\par \par \uc2 Whitman promptly fired her.\par \par \uc2 The rough outlines of Diaz Santillan's life were laid out in her 2000 employment application. She said she went to high school and college in Mexico City and would like to go back to school to study computer administration.\par \par \uc2 She said she has 11 brothers and sisters, eight of them living in the San Francisco Bay area. Whitman's campaign says Diaz Santillan used her sister's documents in her fraudulent application.\par \par \uc2 In her statement, Diaz Santillan said she pleaded with Whitman to get her an immigration attorney but was spurned and fired from the $23-an-hour position she held for nine years.\par \par \uc2 "I was shocked," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101002e6a200016\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Such a move could have negative implications for European tourism, business and diplomacy if travelers fear there's a possibility of terror attacks.\par \par \uc2 DC rally shows support for struggling Democrats\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tapping into anger as the tea party movement has done, a coalition of progressive and civil rights groups marched by the thousands Saturday on the Lincoln Memorial and pledged to support Democrats struggling to keep power on Capitol Hill. "We are together. This march is about the power to the people," said Ed Schultz, host of "The Ed Show" on MSNBC. "It is about the people standing up to the corporations. Are you ready to fight back?"\par \par \uc2 Rutgers honors late student at homecoming game\par \par \uc2 PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) -- Rutgers University paid a public tribute Saturday at a football game to a student who committed suicide last week after his sexual encounter was secretly streamed online. Most in the crowd bowed their heads after a public address announcer requested a moment of silence for 18-year-old freshman Tyler Clementi before the start of the game against its homecoming gam against Tulane.\par \par \uc2 Obama promotes clean energy; GOP hits Dem spending\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wind, solar and other clean energy technologies produce jobs and are essential for the country's environment and economy, President Barack Obama said in promoting his administration's efforts. The president used his weekly radio and Internet address Saturday, a month away from congressional elections, to charge Republicans with wanting to scrap incentives for such projects.\par \par \uc2 20 kidnapped in Mexican resort city of Acapulco\par \par \uc2 ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) -- Gunmen kidnapped 20 men who were traveling together in Mexico's Pacific coast resort city of Acapulco, authorities said Saturday. A shootout between drug gangs, meanwhile, left 14 people dead in remote town in the northern state of Durango, Mexican newspapers reported.\par \par \uc2 Dems, GOP recalibrate strategy a month to election\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats have all but written off at least three Senate seats -- in North Dakota, Indiana and Arkansas -- and at least six House seats in Tennessee, Louisiana, New York and elsewhere as they embark on a final-weeks advertising push to minimize congressional election losses. Emboldened by their prospects, Republicans are throwing at least $3 million into West Virginia in hopes of winning a Senate seat that was long thought out of reach. With polls showing a close race, the GOP decided late last week to boost its initial investment in the state -- the party's latest move to expand a playing field already heavily tilting its way.\par \par \uc2 GOP's Whitman blames opponent for housekeeper flap\par \par \uc2 FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- GOP gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman accused Democratic rival Jerry Brown on Saturday of orchestrating a scandal over her former \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper, a charge that prompted Brown to fire back and say Whitman won't take responsibility and is not fit to be governor. The issue dominated the candidates' second debate, held in one of the most economically distressed regions of the state, after a week that has upended Whitman's campaign.\par \par \uc2 Druids recognized as religion for first time in UK\par \par \uc2 LONDON (AP) -- Druids have been worshipping the sun and earth for thousands of years in Europe, but now they can say they're practicing an officially recognized religion. The ancient pagan tradition best known for gatherings at Stonehenge every summer solstice has been formally classed as a religion under charity law for the first time in Britain, the national charity regulator said Saturday. That means Druids can receive exemptions from taxes on donations -- and now have the same status as such mainstream religions as the Church of England.\par \par \uc2 Clip: Meat made O'Donnell avoid being Hare Krishna\par \par \uc2 WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Delaware Republican Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell once told a TV interviewer that she tried several religions but skipped becoming a Hare Krishna because she didn't want to be vegetarian. Bill Maher aired the clip of that July 9, 1999, interview with O'Donnell on Friday night on his show "Real Time with Bill Maher." The short clip was from an interview on the comedian's former show "Politically Incorrect."\par \par \uc2 LSU gets second chance, beats Vols 16-14\par \par \uc2 BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- No. 12 LSU squandered what looked like its last chance to pull out a victory. A Tennessee mistake on the same frantic sequence gave the Tigers one more shot. The Tigers remained unbeaten with a 16-14 victory on Saturday after a Volunteers penalty for too many players on the field rescued LSU from a botched final play. LSU (5-0, 3-0 SEC) was confused on third-and-goal from the 1 and allowed the clock to run nearly to zero before a mishandled snap seemingly ended the game and sent Tennessee players streaming onto the field in jubilation.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101002e6a200004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

He has First Amendment protections." -- Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox on his colleague, Assistant Attorney General Andrew Shirvell.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Here are comments from Thursday's news developments related to the employment of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  by Republican Meg Whitman and her husband, Dr. Griffith Harsh III. The candidate denies knowing the housekeeper was in the U.S. illegally until June 2009, when she was fired after disclosing it.\par \par \uc2 "When she confessed to us that she had falsified her employment documents and hiring records way back in 2000, we were surprised and shocked." --Meg Whitman.\par \par \uc2 "She had lied to us for nine years. She had misled us for nine years, and it breaks my heart to say that, but that's the truth." -- Meg Whitman.\par \par \uc2 "They wanted to continue to employ an undocumented worker since she was easier to exploit." --Gloria Allred, attorney for the housekeeper.\par \par \uc2 "While I honestly do not recall receiving this letter as it was sent to me seven years ago, I can say it is possible that I would've scratched a follow-up note on a letter like this, which is a request for information to make certain Nikki received her Social Security benefits and W-2 tax refund for withheld wages. Since we believed her to be legal, I would have had no reason to suspect that she would not have filled it in and done what was needed to secure her benefits." --Dr. Griffith Harsh III, in a statement.\par \par \uc2 "The purpose of the letter is to ensure the employee who's had reported earnings is able to obtain the benefits they are entitled to." --Whitman campaign attorney Tom Hiltachk, who added the letter does not question the housekeeper's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "Frankly, I think Jerry Brown should be ashamed of what his allies have tried to do here. Perhaps Jerry Brown has been in politics too long to know any other way to do politics. And this is a baseless smear attack and he should be ashamed of himself." --Meg Whitman.\par \par \uc2 "There's no smearing anyone here. A former employee of Meg Whitman came forward and said she was undocumented. That has nothing to do with us." --Brown spokesman Sterling Clifford.\par \par \uc2 "The allegations are preposterous and are coming from a campaign that is spinning out of control." --Josh Pulliam, consultant with the Service Employees International Union.\par \par \uc2 "Because Nicky had worked for us for 10 years, I was very fond of Nicky and I didn't want to make an example of her. It's not an obligation of the employer to turn in illegal employees. And I, you know, just said I'm not going to make an example of Nicky. I encouraged her to do the right thing." --Meg Whitman.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101001e6a100045\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc56}{\*\bkmkend toc56}\b \uc2 Housekeeper saga carries risks for Whitman push to win Latinos in Calif. governor's race\b0\par\par\uc2 By SAMANTHA YOUNG   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,318 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2010\par 19:39\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - The airwaves in California have been dominated by images of a teary immigrant housekeeper claiming she was mistreated by her billionaire employer and turned away when she asked for citizenship help.\par \par \uc2 It's far from the message Republican Meg Whitman wants to send to the state's crucial Latino voting bloc as she runs for governor.\par \par \uc2 Whitman is accused of knowingly having the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper from Mexico on her payroll for several years in a revelation that has throttled her campaign just as she prepares for a Spanish-language debate Saturday against Democratic opponent Jerry Brown. She needs Latino voters to win in Democratic-leaning California.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has sought to cast the story in a positive way -- careful not to demonize the housekeeper while calling her an extended member of the family. Whitman noted how she and her husband paid her the usual $23-an-hour fee even when they were away on vacation and said the woman is being manipulated by Democratic operatives connected to the campaign of Brown.\par \par \uc2 Even so, the image of a tough-on-immigration gubernatorial candidate getting ensnared in a messy controversy over the legality of her household help is not helpful to a Republican trying to attract the Hispanic vote.\par \par \uc2 The narrative of a Hispanic maid feeling she was mistreated by her wealthy employer is a personal one for many in the Hispanic community, and such a scenario playing out in a campaign could hurt Whitman, some experts say.\par \par \uc2 "The message she sent is a distant, patronizing figure who is willing to use immigrants but doesn't understand their plight," said Louis DeSipio, chairman of Chicano-Latino Studies at the University of California, Irvine. "To the extent Meg Whitman did reach out to Latinos, she's probably lost that initiative."\par \par \uc2 Whitman addressed the controversy head-on during a news conference Thursday in Santa Monica and will get another chance Saturday when she and Brown meet in their second debate in Fresno. This one is sponsored by Univision and is targeted toward a Hispanic audience.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the controversy also could risk Whitman's support among two other key voting blocs: independent voters, who comprise about 20 percent of the electorate, and conservatives, who might question why Whitman didn't report her housekeeper to federal immigration authorities when she acknowledged being in the country illegally in June 2009.\par \par \uc2 Nancy Bolanos, a 31-year-old medical biller in Fresno, is a registered Democrat who said and she's getting annoyed by the governor's race because it's getting "dirty." She said Whitman's stance on immigration has turned her off on the candidate.\par \par \uc2 "I was leaning towards Meg Whitman until the whole immigration thing came on," Bolanos said.\par \par \uc2 The allegations have dominated the governor's race since Nicky Diaz Santillan came forward this week with accusations that Whitman and her husband should have known for years she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Whitman said she only realized the worker was illegal last year -- and she promptly fired her.\par \par \uc2 Her attorney, Gloria Allred of Los Angeles, said she will file a claim against Whitman for unpaid back wages and mileage. Whitman says she will vigorously defend against any such claim.\par \par \uc2 At the heart of the controversy is a 2003 document from the Social Security Administration alerting the Whitman household to discrepancies with the maid's Social Security number, saying it did not match the name on file. Allred produced the letter with what appeared to be handwriting from Whitman's husband, a Stanford neurosurgeon, suggesting that at least he was tipped off to questions about Diaz Santillan's status.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has responded with compassion for her former maid, whom she described as an extended member of her family, while also trying to preserve her campaign pledge to be tough on immigration enforcement. The former chief executive of \uc2 eBay\uc2  says it broke her heart when she fired her maid, she was obligated to do so under federal law.\par \par \uc2 When asked why she didn't offer to help the woman, Whitman said she felt she had to do what was right at the time. She said it would be up to federal immigration authorities to decide whether to start deportation proceedings against Diaz Santillan. Whitman's campaign said Diaz Santillan acknowledged using some of her sister's records when she signed an immigration document and submitted a driver's license and Social Security card.\par \par \uc2 Hispanics are a growing part of California's population, accounting for roughly 37 percent of the state's 38.6 million people. While many are not U.S. citizens or have never registered to vote, Hispanics are projected to make up 15 percent of voters in the Nov. 2 general election, according to a recent Field Poll.\par \par \uc2 A growing number of those voters are relatively new naturalized citizens who don't have any allegiance to a political party, representing a key opportunity for the Republican Party, said Harry Pachon, president of The Tomas Rivera Policy Institute at the University of Southern California.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has aggressively courted Hispanics with Spanish-language radio and television ads, including spots during 15 games of the World Cup. She opened offices in the predominantly Hispanic areas, and has held a number of campaign events with Hispanic leaders.\par \par \uc2 Much of her outreach has focused on job-creation and improving public schools, top issues in the Hispanic community that up until now have overshadowed her views on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has said she does not favor a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million people estimated to be in the country illegally. Instead, she advocates for tighter border security and an expanded guest-worker program.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has tried to refocus the campaign since the controversy erupted on Wednesday, saying voters care more about the state's high unemployment rate and failing schools. She also has sought to divert negative attention to Brown, whom she accused of being behind efforts to manipulate her former housekeeper.\par \par \uc2 Allred, the attorney, is a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates.\par \par \uc2 "I think Latinos are really smart," Whitman told reporters Thursday. "I think they will see this for exactly what it is, which is one giant political stunt and smear campaign by a desperate Brown campaign. Thirty days out, this is so obvious what is going on."\par \par \uc2 The Brown campaign and his labor-backed allies have denied any involvement.\par \par \uc2 In an effort at damage control, Whitman's campaign launched an immediate response to counter Diaz Santillan's allegations, dispatching Spanish-speaking surrogates to explain Whitman's side of the story. One of their key points: Diaz Santillan was hardly mistreated when she worked just 15 hours a week for the Whitman family and was paid $23 an hour.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the discussion now is what is going to happen to this woman and her family," said Whitman Spanish media spokesman Hector Barajas. "Is she being used? Did they force her, knowing she was undocumented, to testify?"\par \par \uc2 One of the state's largest public employee unions intends to keep the incident fresh in voters' minds as part of a $5 million Spanish-language media campaign starting Saturday. It accuses Whitman of saying one thing in her Spanish-language campaign ads and another when she speaks in English.\par \par \uc2 "I think they're going to see what's happened to their grandmothers, their mothers, their sisters," Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, said of Latino voters. "They get hired by rich people, get exploited and they put up with it in the hope that it will lead to help legalizing their status. Finally, when they ask for help, they find themselves fired and put on the street."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Garance Burke contributed to this report from Fresno.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101001e6a10000n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - The agency that Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman used to hire her former housekeeper on Thursday defended itself, saying it followed standard procedures in requesting documents from potential employees and providing forms to employers.\par \par \uc2 The owners of Town & Country Resources, which has offices in Palo Alto and San Francisco, issued a statement after Whitman identified the agency she used.\par \par \uc2 Jens and Carrie Hillen said they bought the agency two years ago, years after Nicky Diaz Santillan started working for Whitman. Diaz Santillan has accused Whitman of knowing she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  since 2003, but the former \uc2 eBay\uc2  CEO denies knowing her legal status until June 2009.\par \par \uc2 "As already reported, Nicky Diaz did fill out our standard candidate questionnaire. In that questionnaire, Nicky indicated that she was legally able to work in the United States," the Hillens wrote. "Further, Nicky provided us and our client with the documents that our client would need to complete the I-9 form as was their legal obligation as an employer."\par \par \uc2 Whitman said Thursday she does not recall what happened to the I-9 form.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not sure whether we signed it," Whitman said.\par \par \uc2 Whitman said repeatedly that she and her husband, Dr. Griffith Harsh, were shocked when Diaz Santillan, their housekeeper of nine years, came to them and confessed she was in the U.S. illegally in June 2009, nearly five months after Whitman had announced an exploratory run for California governor.\par \par \uc2 She said she immediately suspended her and later fired her.\par \par \uc2 Gloria Allred, the attorney representing Diaz Santillan, suggested that Whitman and Harsh were aware of the immigration problem years ago. Allred released a copy of a purported 2003 letter from the Social Security Administration that she says shows Harsh had partially filled out. It noted a discrepancy in Diaz Santillan's Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 The Hillens said since 2006, the agency has been using a third party to conduct background checks on prospective employees.\par \par \uc2 "We will not tolerate anyone who falsely represents themselves," the owners wrote.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100930e69u002qh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

AG Coakley, GOP challenger McKenna clash over death penalty in first debate of campaign\b0\par\par\uc2 By GLEN JOHNSON   \par \uc2 AP Political Writer\par \uc2 643 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2010\par 17:31\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWTON, Mass. (AP) - The murder of four people in Boston this week should prompt renewed discussion of the death penalty in Massachusetts, Republican attorney general candidate James McKenna said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 In his first debate -- and face-to-face meeting -- with Democrat Martha Coakley, the former prosecutor said the "execution" of a 2-year-old amid a group in the Mattapan neighborhood justifies reconsideration of capital punishment.\par \par \uc2 Yet McKenna would not define the age up to which it should be applied, except to say it should be instituted for the murder of a police officer. He later added terrorists to the group, emblematic of the new candidate's fast-unfolding campaign.\par \par \uc2 "Obviously we don't know the facts here yet, and we shouldn't speak authoritatively yet, at this point, but this case may put the death penalty back on the table," he said during a 15-minute debate on New England Cable News moderated by host Jim Braude.\par \par \uc2 Coakley said she opposes the death penalty, arguing it has not proven to be a deterrent and could be applied mistakenly.\par \par \uc2 "Whoever did this should be found guilty of murder and put in jail for the rest of their lives," she said afterward.\par \par \uc2 During the debate, McKenna was evasive when asked about gay marriage, which the Supreme Judicial Court legalized in Massachusetts in 2003. Coakley supports it and has since challenged the legality of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and woman.\par \par \uc2 Coakley has won a first round in federal court by arguing it creates discrimination between gay and straight Bay State residents in the aftermath of the SJC ruling.\par \par \uc2 "The attorney general's role is to enforce law, not revisit settled law, such as that," said McKenna. "The death penalty is different. I think in light to the massacre in Mattapan, we will be faced again with that exact question."\par \par \uc2 Following the debate, McKenna told reporters he does not oppose homosexual relationships between adults, nor does he intend to try to overturn the Supreme Court ruling. Yet, as he did during the debate, the 49-year-old former prosecutor refused to answer whether he personally agreed with the decision to legalize gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 Coakley was beaten in January by Republican Scott Brown during the high-profile special election to replace the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. She was cruising to re-election without an opponent this fall when McKenna won a late bid for the Republican nomination through a write-in campaign.\par \par \uc2 McKenna's campaign has since been overtaken by experienced staff from the Massachusetts Republican Party and veterans of Brown's campaign, who now oversee his schedule, website and interactions with reporters.\par \par \uc2 Throughout the debate, Coakley tried to minimize distance between herself and McKenna, who garnered nearly three times the number of write-in votes required despite being a first-time candidate. He could now potentially ride the same anti-incumbent wave that propelled Brown to victory in traditionally Democratic Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 At one point, McKenna and the attorney general sparred over her recent statement that it was not technically illegal, under state law, to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 "It is technically illegal to be illegal here," said McKenna.\par \par \uc2 Coakley cut him off, saying, "Against federal law, of course, I agree with that. We don't disagree on that statement, Jim. That statement was taken out of context and we don't disagree."\par \par \uc2 At another point, Coakley said she favored the expanded use of surveillance cameras, labeling them "a deterrent and it's an effective tool."\par \par \uc2 McKenna said: "That needs study. As we decide whether to put more cameras out there we really need to be careful about what we are doing."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100930e69u002ha\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman on Thursday accused the campaign of Democrat Jerry Brown of being behind the accusations that she knew her housekeeper was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive said Brown, the public employee unions that support the Democratic candidate and the attorney representing her former housekeeper of nine years are behind the allegations that have rocked the gubernatorial campaign five weeks before Election Day.\par \par \uc2 "The Brown campaign and Gloria Allred are doing a massive smear campaign on me and my family," Whitman said during an hour-long news conference at a Santa Monica hotel.\par \par \uc2 Brown campaign spokesman Sterling Clifford said Whitman was merely trying to divert attention away from the allegations.\par \par \uc2 "There's no smearing anyone here," he said. "A former employee of Meg Whitman came forward and said she was undocumented. That has nothing to do with us."\par \par \uc2 Whitman called the news conference to address allegations made Wednesday by Allred, a high-profile celebrity attorney in Los Angeles. Allred is representing the housekeeper and claimed that Whitman had reason to suspect the woman was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  as far back as 2003 but did not fire her until June 2009, five months after Whitman formed her exploratory committee to run for governor.\par \par \uc2 The key question is whether Whitman received letters from the Social Security Administration indicating that the Social Security number given by the housekeeper did not match her name in official files. Whitman said she had never seen such a letter and used the news conference to turn the focus on Brown, the state's attorney general.\par \par \uc2 Whitman said she always had a good relationship with the housekeeper, Nicky Diaz Santillan, whom she paid $23 an hour. She said believes the woman is being used to alter the direction of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 "I think Nicky had a gun to her head ... I think she's been manipulated by a very sophisticated attorney," Whitman said. "I absolutely believe this is linked to the Brown campaign."\par \par \uc2 Allred is a longtime Democratic supporter who donated $150 to Brown's campaign account in 2006 and was a superdelegate for Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008. Clifford, the Brown campaign spokesman, said he did not believe the $150 donation was "a very strong tie" between the two.\par \par \uc2 During the news conference, Whitman mentioned a news report about the accusations Wednesday night on KTVU-2 in San Francisco. In its story, the station said a Brown campaign aide told its political reporter two weeks ago to watch for developments related to a Whitman housekeeper.\par \par \uc2 KTVU news director Ed Chapuis said its report "was 100 percent accurate."\par \par \uc2 When asked about the KTVU story, Clifford said, "There have been rumors about hiring practices for Meg Whitman a long time."\par \par \uc2 Whitman said Democrats and their supporters in the public employee unions are desperate about the state of the gubernatorial race as the Nov. 2 general election approaches.\par \par \uc2 One of the state's largest public employee unions is starting a Spanish-language media campaign on Saturday accusing Whitman of saying one thing in her Spanish-language campaign ads and another when she speaks in English.\par \par \uc2 The television ad that will air in Los Angeles and Fresno said Whitman attacks illegal immigrants "to win votes, but an undocumented woman worked in her home for nine years."\par \par \uc2 Josh Pulliam, a consultant for the Service Employees International Union, said the ad was developed months ago after a series of focus groups and was altered Wednesday after Whitman's former housekeeper came forward.\par \par \uc2 "All we did was insert another example of how this woman says one thing and does something completely different," Pulliam said.\par \par \uc2 The union said it was spending $5 million on the campaign, which will include TV, radio, online ads, mailers and field operations designed to undercut Whitman's outreach to Hispanic voters.\par \par \uc2 Whitman questioned the timing and the inclusion of the charges in the TV ad so close to the allegations being made public.\par \par \uc2 "I think Latinos are really smart," Whitman said during her news conference. "I think they will see this for exactly what it is, which is one giant political stunt and smear campaign by a desperate Brown campaign. Thirty days out this is so obvious what is going on."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100930e69u002bq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - They weren't as funny as television \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2  host Stephen Colbert, but media moguls \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2  and Michael Bloomberg made a similar appeal to Congress: Do something about immigration.\par \par \uc2 Murdoch, the founder of \uc2 News Corp\uc2 ., urged lawmakers during a hearing Thursday to match attempts to secure the border with efforts to ensure that employers can't hire people illegally.\par \par \uc2 For his part, Bloomberg, the mayor of New York as well as the founder of the financial news and information service bearing his name, told lawmakers that they should show some leadership on the issue.\par \par \uc2 "We need immigrants," Bloomberg said. "That's the future of this country and whether the public understands that or not it's Congress' job to lead."\par \par \uc2 The pair made their pleas before the same House immigration subcommittee that heard tongue-in-cheek testimony on the plight of farmworkers from the "Colbert Report" star last Friday. However, Murdoch and Bloomberg did not pack the hearing room as Colbert did for his appearance.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not a fan of the government doing anything," Colbert told lawmakers, "but I've got to ask, 'Why isn't the government doing anything?'"\par \par \uc2 Murdoch and Bloomberg lead a coalition of businesses and mayors to push for immigration reform. The group supports providing a path to legal status for those in the U.S. illegally. Murdoch himself was born in Australia and, while expanding his interests in U.S. media, became an American citizen in 1985. Citizenship allowed him to own U.S. television stations.\par \par \uc2 "As an immigrant, I chose to live in America because it is one of the freest and most vibrant nations in the world. And as an immigrant, I feel an obligation to speak up for immigration policies that will keep America the most economically robust, creative and freedom-loving nation in the world," he said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population has tripled in the U.S., even as the government has increased enforcement spending almost every year since 1992, Murdoch said. The wave of immigrants only started to crest when the country hit a recession, he said.\par \par \uc2 Murdoch and Bloomberg said they believe Congress needs to help employers discern between workers authorized to work in the U.S and those who are not. The Obama administration has been auditing employers to find those hiring people illegally.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat, told Murdoch she thought his support for immigration reform did not match coverage of the immigration issue by Fox News, which is a large part of his \uc2 News Corp\uc2 . empire. She said his testimony was contradictory to Fox News "talking about anchor babies." The term, considered derogatory by some, is a reference to children born to at least one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parent.\par \par \uc2 "Why don't you use your power to help us to promote what you are talking about?" Waters asked.\par \par \uc2 "I would say that we do," Murdoch said. "We certainly employ a lot of immigrants at Fox ... and we do not take any consistent anti-immigrant line."\par \par \uc2 Murdoch said he would have no trouble supporting his hearing testimony on Fox News, "nor would a great number of the commentators on Fox News."\par \par \uc2 Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., chair of the subcommittee, said the hearing lays the groundwork for "sensible reform" in the months ahead, though not likely this year.\par \par \uc2 Separately, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., filed a comprehensive immigration bill Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Hearing testimony: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear--100930.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear--100930.html}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100930e69u001ux\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NC Highway Patrol says 3 people, not 5, killed in weather-related crash on rain-slicked road\par \par \uc2 RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The North Carolina Highway Patrol says three people were killed when the sport utility vehicle they were traveling in skidded off a rain-slicked road and tumbled into a ditch filled with water.\par \par \uc2 State Highway Patrol Trooper Gary Edwards said troopers initially reported five people were killed because two children, 2-year-old twins, did not have a pulse when emergency workers arrived on scene. But the children survived and were being treated late Thursday afternoon.\par \par \uc2 Edwards said the family of five from Atlanta was traveling westbound on U.S. 64 east of Creswell around 12:20 p.m. Thursday when their Jeep hit a patch of standing water, hydroplaned and skidded off the highway into the ditch.\par \par \uc2 Creswell is approximately 145 miles east of Raleigh.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 AP sources: Emanuel to resign as White House chief of staff Friday, to begin Chicago mayor bid\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) -- Rahm Emanuel will resign as White House chief of staff on Friday and will begin his campaign for Chicago mayor by meeting with voters in the city on Monday, two people familiar with Emanuel's plans said.\par \par \uc2 The two people, who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity because they did not want to pre-empt Emanuel's announcement, said he will return to Chicago over the weekend and begin touring neighborhoods Monday.\par \par \uc2 "He intends to run for mayor," one of the people told The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 Both people said they did not know when Emanuel would make an official announcement about his mayoral bid but that he would launch a website with a message to Chicago voters in the near future.\par \par \uc2 White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said President Barack Obama plans to make a personnel announcement Friday.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Lawyer says Meg Whitman's husband saw letter warning of ex-maid's illegal status\par \par \uc2 SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- The attorney for Meg Whitman's former housekeeper released a copy Thursday of a purported 2003 letter that she says shows the Republican gubernatorial candidate knew all along that the maid might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The letter from the Social Security Administration has emerged as a potentially explosive document in the California governor's race between Whitman and Democrat Jerry Brown. Whitman has called for tougher sanctions against employers who hire illegal workers, and the fact that she had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  on her payroll for a number of years could undercut her credibility.\par \par \uc2 At issue is whether Whitman knew about the government letter in 2003, as attorney Gloria Allred and the former housekeeper have alleged. Whitman said she and her husband never saw the letter.\par \par \uc2 But Allred produced a copy of the letter Thursday that she says shows Whitman's husband, Dr. Griffith Harsh, partially filled it out. If true, that would mean Whitman and her husband were aware of the immigration problem years ago.\par \par \uc2 "At bottom of letter, "Dr. Harsh has written: 'Nicky, please check this. Thanks,'" Allred said, adding that the housekeeper recognized the handwriting as belonging to Whitman's husband.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Good news for couch potatoes: Senate votes to ban annoyingly loud TV commercials\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to turn down the volume on those loud TV commercials that send couch potatoes diving for their remote controls looks like it'll soon become law.\par \par \uc2 The Senate unanimously passed a bill late Wednesday to require television stations and cable companies to keep commercials at the same volume as the programs they interrupt.\par \par \uc2 The House has passed similar legislation. Before it can become law, minor differences between the two versions have to be worked out when Congress returns to Washington after the Nov. 2 election.\par \par \uc2 Ever since television caught on in the 1950s, the Federal Communication Commission has been getting complaints about blaring commercials. But the FCC concluded in 1984 there was no fair way to write regulations controlling the "apparent loudness" of commercials. So it hasn't been regulating them.\par \par \uc2 Correcting sound levels is more complicated than using the remote control. The television shows and ads come from a variety of sources, from local businesses to syndicators.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Police protesters throw Ecuador into chaos, seize airport, blocking roads\par \par \uc2 QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The government declared a state of siege Thursday after rebellious police angered by a law that cuts their benefits plunged this small South American nation into chaos, roughing up the president, shutting down airports and blocking highways in a nationwide strike.\par \par \uc2 Incensed officers shoved President Rafael Correa around and pelted him with tear gas and water when he tried to speak at a police barracks in the capital.\par \par \uc2 Correa, 47, was hospitalized from the effects of the gas.\par \par \uc2 The state of siege puts the military in charge of public order, suspending civil liberties and allowing soldiers to carry out searches without a warrant.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of officers involved in the insurrection took over police barracks in Quito, Guayaquil and other cities. Some set up roadblocks of burning tires, cutting off highway access to the capital.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 NJ college student's suicide illustrates the Internet's dangers; gay activists decry his fate\par \par \uc2 PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) -- The shocking suicide of a college student whose sex life was broadcast over the Web illustrates yet again the Internet's alarming potential as a means of tormenting others and raises questions whether young people in the age of Twitter and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  can even distinguish public from private.\par \par \uc2 Cruel gossip and vengeful acts once confined to the schoolyard or the dorm can now make their way around the world instantly via the Internet, along with photos and live video.\par \par \uc2 "It's just a matter of when the next suicide's going to hit, when the next attack's going to hit," said Parry Aftab, a New Jersey lawyer who runs the website WiredSafety.\par \par \uc2 Last week, Tyler Clementi, a shy, 18-year-old Rutgers University freshman and gifted violist, jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge after his roommate and another classmate allegedly used a webcam to secretly broadcast his dorm-room sexual encounters with another man. The two classmates have been charged with invasion of privacy, with the most serious charges carrying up to five years in prison.\par \par \uc2 The suicide shocked and disturbed gay rights activists and others on campus.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Ancient penguin stood 5 feet and fossil feathers show brown and gray color, clues to evolution\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some ancient penguins may have been twice as big as today's Emperor penguin but they lacked the dashing tuxedo. Researchers unearthed remains of a nearly 5-foot-tall penguin that roamed what is now Peru about 36 million years ago, and they also discovered fossilized feathers that show back then, the flightless bird was a more motley mix of reddish-brown and gray.\par \par \uc2 Thursday's report in the journal Science is more than a curiosity about color. Analyzing the fossil led to a new discovery about modern penguins, which in turn raises questions about how their feathers evolved to help them become such expert swimmers.\par \par \uc2 It's one of the largest penguins that ever lived, estimated to have been twice as heavy as the average Emperor penguin of today. The second species of giant penguin discovered in Peru, it was given the name Inkayacu paracasensis, or Water King, part of a cluster of now-extinct penguin species that apparently ranged over much of the Southern Hemisphere.\par \par \uc2 A stroke of luck helped paleontologists find the feathers. A student on the dig team, from the Museo de Historia Natural in Lima, discovered the fossil's foot and noticed it had scales, evidence of soft tissue that's rarely preserved. Maybe there was more soft tissue, and if so, they'd have to excavate extra carefully.\par \par \uc2 "We got incredibly excited," said paleontologist Julia Clarke of the University of Texas at Austin, who led the team. "Moving really slowly, flake by flake by flake through this giant block," they eventually uncovered a flipper with layers of small feathers and under it, fossilized body feathers, too.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 In massive \uc2 Fisher-Price\uc2  recall, gov't cites hazards of 11 million tricycles, toys, high chairs\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- \uc2 Fisher-Price\uc2  is recalling more than 11 million tricycles, toys and high chairs over safety concerns.\par \par \uc2 The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday that the tricycles and high chairs were blamed for children's injuries.\par \par \uc2 In the recall of about 7 million \uc2 Fisher-Price\uc2  Trikes and Tough Trikes toddler tricycles, the agency is aware of 10 reports of children being hurt. Six of them required medical attention.\par \par \uc2 The trikes -- some of which feature popular characters like Dora the Explorer and Barbie -- have a protruding plastic ignition key near the seat that children can strike, sit on or fall on, leading to injuries that the commission said can include genital bleeding.\par \par \uc2 Fisher-Price\uc2  is also recalling more than 1 million Healthy Care, Easy Clean and Close to Me High Chairs, after 14 reports of problems. The pegs on the back of the high chairs can be used to store the tray, but children can fall on them, resulting in cuts and other injuries. Seven children required stitches, the commission said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Defiance, resilience marked career of 'Some Like It Hot' star Tony Curtis\par \par \uc2 From dressing in drag to posing nude for his 80th birthday, Tony Curtis truly was a defiant one.\par \par \uc2 He overcame early typecasting as a lightweight pretty boy to become a serious actor in such films as "Sweet Smell of Success," "Spartacus" and "The Defiant Ones," the latter earning him an Academy Award nomination.\par \par \uc2 He resisted obsolescence, continually reshaping himself and taking lesser roles to find steady work in a business that prizes youth. He subdued alcohol and drug addictions, lived through six marriages and five divorces, and found peace with a new art as a painter.\par \par \uc2 Curtis, whose wildly undefinable cast of characters ranged from a Roman slave leading the rebellious cry of "I'm Spartacus" to a jazz age musician wooing Marilyn Monroe while disguised as a woman in "Some Like It Hot," died Wednesday night.\par \par \uc2 The 85-year-old actor suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Henderson, Nev., near Las Vegas, the coroner said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Intercepted! Wrong number on Ochocinco's cereal sends callers to sex line instead of charity\par \par \uc2 CINCINNATI (AP) -- Charity-minded callers are getting intercepted by a phone-sex line because of a typo on Chad Ochocinco's Cereal boxes. The phone number is supposed to connect callers to Feed the Children, which benefits from sales of the Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver's cereal.\par \par \uc2 But the box has the wrong toll-free prefix, meaning callers get a seductive-sounding woman who makes risque suggestions and then asks for a credit card number.\par \par \uc2 Cincinnati-based \uc2 Kroger Co\uc2 . said Thursday it was pulling all Ochocinco cereal boxes from its grocery shelves because of the error. Some local stores had them on special display after the launch about a month ago.\par \par \uc2 Pittsburgh-based PLB Sports Inc., which specializes in limited-edition products featuring star athletes and their favorite charities, apologized for the error in a statement Thursday. The statement said the boxes will be re-issued with the correct toll-free number.\par \par \uc2 Ochocinco told WCPO-TV that the number was clearly a mistake and he's sure that the maker will fix the problem.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100930e69u001jr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

BLOOD and JULIET WILLIAMS   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers\par \uc2 1,164 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2010\par 19:17\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - Meg Whitman's campaign for governor was thrown into turmoil Thursday as the Republican sought to fend off new evidence that she knowingly had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper on her payroll for nearly a decade.\par \par \uc2 Whitman denounced the allegations as a "baseless smear attack" by Democratic challenger Jerry Brown in what has become a dead-heat race five weeks before the election. She says she fired the $23-an-hour housekeeper last year immediately after learning she was illegal.\par \par \uc2 The immigration dispute has upended a contest that until now been focused on serious issues such as job creation, state spending and education in a state with a $19 billion deficit and 12.4 percent unemployment.\par \par \uc2 Now, the focus is on whether the billionaire GOP nominee for governor will take a polygraph test to respond to allegations brought by a celebrity-seeking attorney and her mysterious housekeeper client.\par \par \uc2 Revelations about the illegal housekeeper have also thrown Whitman's carefully managed campaign completely off track and opened the door for Democrats to accuse her of hypocrisy.\par \par \uc2 The former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive has called for tougher sanctions against employers who hire illegal workers, and the fact that she employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  maid from Mexico for nine years could undermine her credibility. She has also spent millions courting Latino voters, who could play a key role in determining the outcome of the race.\par \par \uc2 A letter sent to Whitman from the Social Security Administration in 2003 has emerged as a crucial element in the dispute. The letter warned Whitman that there were discrepancies in housekeeper Nicky Diaz Santillan's payroll documents, a possible tip-off that she could be illegal.\par \par \uc2 Whitman said she never got the letter and suggested the former maid might have intercepted it since she was in charge of the mail at the family's Silicon Valley mansion.\par \par \uc2 The housekeeper and lawyer Gloria Allred later produced a copy of the letter that they say shows Whitman's husband, Dr. Griffith Harsh III, partially filled it out and told the housekeeper to "check on this."\par \par \uc2 Allred said the housekeeper recognized the writing as belonging to Whitman's husband, and a handwriting specialist may be brought in to analyze her husband's penmanship. She claims it could prove that Whitman and her husband knew years earlier that Diaz Santillan might be illegal.\par \par \uc2 In a statement released by the campaign, Harsh said he did not recall receiving the letter, although it's possible he scratched out the note asking Diaz Santillan to follow-up. He noted, however, that the letter does not say Diaz Santillan is illegal, it merely asks for more information.\par \par \uc2 "The essential fact remains the same, neither Meg nor I believed there was a problem with Nicky's legal status," the husband said. "The facts of this matter are very clear: Ms. Diaz broke the law and lied to us and to the employment agency."\par \par \uc2 The story has consumed the two full days of news cycles just as Whitman and Brown are preparing for a Saturday Spanish-language debate that will include questions of importance to the Hispanic community.\par \par \uc2 One of the state's largest public employee unions immediately released a Spanish-language attack ad accusing Whitman of a double standard on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Whitman, who has revealed few details about her personal life since announcing her first run for office last year, was forced to spend 45 minutes answering questions from reporters about what she knew and when she knew it, her husband standing awkwardly by throughout.\par \par \uc2 "You know, I've only been in politics for two years. I'm just getting used to the smear politics, I'm just getting used to the politics of personal destruction," she told dozens of reporters hastily gathered at a hotel in Santa Monica.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has spent a record $119 million of her own money on the race, and her campaign has been marked by its uncanny ability to stay on message. That marks a notable contrast with Brown, the state's attorney general and a former governor known for talking off-the-cuff, sometimes too much.\par \par \uc2 The timing of the allegations so close to the Spanish-speaking debate, the lack of extensive documentation, and Allred's Democratic ties left her open to questions about motive. Allred once gave money to Brown, and she was a Hillary Rodham Clinton delegate at the Democratic National Convention in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Allred, who is well-known for orchestrating media stunts, has not permitted Diaz Santillan to answer a single question from reporters over two days of news conferences. The former housekeeper read a brief, prepared statement Wednesday that alleged brusque treatment during her nine-year tenure. Whitman said it was "not the Nicky I know."\par \par \uc2 Allred said Thursday she is not providing any financial support to her client and added her involvement with Diaz Santillan started "within the last week."\par \par \uc2 Two days after she made the allegations that reordered the race for governor, Diaz Santillan remains a mystery. Virtually nothing is known about her activities or whereabouts from the time Whitman fired her in June 2009 until she appeared Wednesday with Allred at her Los Angeles law office.\par \par \uc2 Whitman was repeatedly asked why she didn't just own up to this huge political liability earlier to avoid a late election-cycle surprise such as this, particularly since she has repeatedly stressed the need to hold employers accountable for hiring illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 She said she didn't want to subject Diaz Santillan to the scrutiny -- and left unsaid, deportation -- that could have resulted from her reporting it. Whitman also noted that in California, employers bear no responsibility to report illegal worker, only to not knowingly hire and employ them.\par \par \uc2 "Because Nicky had worked for us for 10 years, I was very fond of Nicky and I didn't want to make an example of her. It's not an obligation of the employer to turn in illegal employees," she said.\par \par \uc2 The revelations come suspiciously close to Saturday's Fresno debate, which will air statewide on Spanish-language television in an effort by both camps to target one of the most highly sought-after voting blocs in the state. Hispanics are projected to comprise just 15 percent of voters in the Nov. 2 general election, but both sides have aggressively targeted them as potential swing votes.\par \par \uc2 Brown's spokesman, Sterling Clifford, said in a statement that Whitman apparently thinks the rules don't apply to her.\par \par \uc2 "After more than a year of Whitman demanding immigration policy that 'holds employers accountable,' we learn that accountability doesn't extend to her own actions," he said.\par \par \uc2 Clifford said the Browns use a well-known national housekeeping service that comes twice a month to their home in the Oakland Hills. He said Brown has never knowingly employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100930e69u0001e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NC Patrol: 4 people killed in wreck on wet road\par \par \uc2 RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Four people, including two children, were killed Thursday when the sport utility vehicle they were traveling in skidded off a rain-slicked highway and tumbled into a ditch filled with water, troopers said. State Highway Patrol Trooper Gary Edwards said troopers initially reported five people were killed because two children, 3-year-old twins, did not have a pulse when emergency workers arrived on scene.\par \par \uc2 Calif. governor's race upended by immigrant maid\par \par \uc2 SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Meg Whitman's campaign for governor was thrown into turmoil Thursday as the Republican sought to fend off new evidence that she knowingly had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper on her payroll for nearly a decade. Whitman denounced the allegations as a "baseless smear attack" by Democratic challenger Jerry Brown in what has become a dead-heat race five weeks before the election. She says she fired the $23-an-hour housekeeper last year immediately after learning she was illegal.\par \par \uc2 AP sources: Emanuel leaving White House on Friday\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) -- White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel is set to give up his influential national post Friday to begin a run for Chicago mayor, a job he has long coveted but won't win unless he persuades voters he's still one of them. People close to Emanuel said he will fly home over the weekend and hit the streets Monday to talk to voters, after announcing his resignation Friday. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs says only that President Barack Obama will make a "personnel announcement" Friday morning, but even his vague comments made it eminently clear Emanuel is leaving.\par \par \uc2 Protesting police throw Ecuador into chaos\par \par \uc2 QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Hundreds of police angry over a law that would cut their benefits plunged this small South American nation into chaos Thursday, roughing up and tear-gassing the president, shutting down airports and blocking highways in a nationwide strike. At least one person was killed and six injured in clashes between police and supporters of President Rafael Correa, the security minister said.\par \par \uc2 Boehner urges congressional reform as vote nears\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jettisoning partisan campaign-season rhetoric, if only for a moment, House Republican leader John Boehner said Thursday that both parties bear the blame for "dysfunction in Congress" and urged lawmakers to adopt a cut-as-you-go-rule to curb their appetite for spending on new federal programs. The Ohio Republican spoke hours after engineering a final partisan, pre-election showdown on the House floor, and one senior Democrat, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, swiftly denounced him as an agent of "gridlock and failure."\par \par \uc2 Fisher-Price\uc2  recalls more than 11M kid products\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- \uc2 Fisher-Price\uc2  is recalling more than 11 million tricycles, toys and high chairs over safety concerns. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday that the tricycles and high chairs were blamed for children's injuries.\par \par \uc2 Senate votes to turn down volume on TV commercials\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to turn down the volume on those loud TV commercials that send couch potatoes diving for their remote controls looks like it'll soon become law. The Senate unanimously passed a bill late Wednesday to require television stations and cable companies to keep commercials at the same volume as the programs they interrupt.\par \par \uc2 NJ student's suicide illustrates Internet dangers\par \par \uc2 PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) -- The shocking suicide of a college student whose sex life was broadcast over the Web illustrates yet again the Internet's alarming potential as a means of tormenting others and raises questions whether young people in the age of Twitter and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  can even distinguish public from private. Cruel gossip and vengeful acts once confined to the schoolyard or the dorm can now make their way around the world instantly via the Internet, along with photos and live video.\par \par \uc2 Health care law may hamper limited insurance plans\par \par \uc2 INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The new health care law could make it difficult for companies like \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  to continue offering limited insurance coverage to their low-wage workers. The world's largest hamburger chain provides its hourly workers with low-cost plans known as "mini-meds" or limited benefits plans. These plans typically cover things like doctor's office visits and prescription drugs. But they don't provide comprehensive coverage, and they often come with a cap on how much the insurer pays in annual benefits that is much lower than a major medical insurance plan.\par \par \uc2 Police: Drunk man drives drunk woman to station\par \par \uc2 CLAWSON, Mich. (AP) -- Police said a 40-year-old man faces drunk driving charges after he drove an intoxicated woman to the police station. Police said Donald Chamberlain, from Clawson, drove his 35-year-old neighbor to the station Monday to answer questions about an assault involving her husband the previous day. The Macomb Daily of Mount Clemens reported the woman left the station with Chamberlain after telling officers she was too drunk to answer questions.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100930e69u0000e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Critics of a proposed anti-illegal immigration law in Mississippi called it an unfunded mandate for law enforcement and urged the state to avoid rushing to adopt a measure akin to one facing legal challenges in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 One attorney for an immigrant advocacy group also called attempted moves toward an Arizona-styled anti-illegal immigration law a form of "hysteria" by those seeking scapegoats in an economic downturn marked by high joblessness.\par \par \uc2 Patricia Ice, legal project director for the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance, told a state Senate panel on Wednesday that illegal immigrants aren't a drain on state finances. Ice said some of the state's illegal immigrants pay income tax and all pay sales taxes. She said she's helped some immigrants get tax identification numbers that can be used to pay income taxes.\par \par \uc2 "We're seeing a form of hysteria about immigrants. Because of the poor economy here, many of us have to blame someone," Ice said during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary A Committee.\par \par \uc2 The committee held hearings this week to examine a proposal similar to the law passed in Arizona that requires police while enforcing other laws to check the status of people if there is reason to suspect they are in the country illegally. Mississippi is among several states considering immigration-enforcement proposals modeled after Arizona's.\par \par \uc2 Senate Judiciary A Committee Chairman Joey Fillingane said the hearings were held before the session starts in January so more time could be devoted to the issue. He said the topic could be lost as lawmakers begin work on a state spending plan.\par \par \uc2 Sam Atkinson, director of performance audits at the state Auditor's Office, said it's difficult to calculate the state's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population because few entities track that data.\par \par \uc2 Atkinson said some estimates are based federal reports, including those from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. She said the auditor's office will use the latest Census information when it is released to update a 2006 report that said illegal immigrants cost the state $25 million in medical, educational and correctional services.\par \par \uc2 The report was compiled when Lt. Gov. Phil Bryant was still the state auditor. Bryant often cites illegal immigration as a problem when he speaks at political events, including tea party meetings.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers provided a draft of the proposed legislation, but Fillingane, R-Sumrall, said it could change by the time it's filed next session. It is similar to the law that went into effect in Arizona earlier this year. A federal judge has struck down several provisions of the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Hillman Frazier, D-Jackson, said he wouldn't support the proposal next session because it would be an unfunded mandate on law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Kelvin Butler, D-Magnolia, said he doesn't think Mississippi should move forward on the proposal until the federal courts resolve the issue in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "I think we're being a little too hasty," Butler said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100929e69t002gj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - A Mississippi sheriff told state lawmakers Tuesday his deputies take illegal immigrants into custody on a nearly hourly basis, and the booking process has burdened his department.\par \par \uc2 Madison County Sheriff Toby Trowbridge told a Senate panel it's difficult to keep track of illegal immigrants because they don't have identification and they may use variations of their names each time they're picked up.\par \par \uc2 "We encounter one or two people an hour in Madison County," Trowbridge said. "It's a security problem. Anytime you encounter anyone without identification, we view it as a homeland security problem." Not all of them face charges in Mississippi; many are being held for immigration authorities, he said.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Judiciary A Committee was holding hearings this week to gather information for a plan to introduce a bill like the law in Arizona that allows police officers to check the status of people they think might be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Some lawmakers have said they would support such a measure during the 2011 session that starts in January. Opponents say the proposal could foster racial-profiling and harassment.\par \par \uc2 Mississippi isn't a border state like Arizona. Officials don't know the size of the state's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population, but most agree it is far smaller than Arizona's.\par \par \uc2 Trowbridge said the proposed law would help police and sheriff's departments by forcing immigrants to pursue legal status and get identification. But Mississippi Public Safety Commissioner Steve Simpson said he doesn't want legislators to pass an unfunded mandate.\par \par \uc2 Simpson said state troopers routinely ask for identification after stopping someone for a violation. He said detaining illegal immigrants isn't a "widespread" problem for troopers.\par \par \uc2 "We're stretched very thin right now and do not need a lot of unfunded mandates on us," Simpson said.\par \par \uc2 Republican Lt. Gov. Phil Bryant, who observed the hearing, said the federal government's lawsuit to block Arizona's law shouldn't prevent Mississippi from pursuing its own legislation "that would stand up to a federal challenge."\par \par \uc2 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joey Fillingane, R-Sumrall, said the hearing would help determine how the proposal could be tweaked to fit Mississippi's needs. After the hearing, Fillingane said the proposal "had merit."\par \par \uc2 Karla Valez, a case worker who works with immigrants for Catholic Charities, said immigrants already live in fear of being harassed. She said many would leave the state if a tougher law was enacted.\par \par \uc2 "Mississippi would be hostile," Valez said. "They would be targeting people who don't look white or African American."\par \par \uc2 In recent years, many anti-immigration proposals have cleared the Republican-led Senate, but died in the Democrat-controlled House.\par \par \uc2 However, Mississippi passed a law in 2008 requiring employers to use the federal E-Verify website to check new workers' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Some asked during the hearings whether the law is being enforced. The state Attorney General's Office has not received any complaints about violations, said agency spokeswoman Jan Schaefer.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the proposal said adopting additional immigration-enforcment laws could further erode the migrant worker population.\par \par \uc2 Gene Saucier, a tree farmer and former legislator, said south Mississippi's timber, blueberry and poultry industries depend on immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Saucier, who is a member of the Resource Conservation and Development Council for the state, said it's been hard to find Americans who want to do the labor-intensive jobs.\par \par \uc2 Saucier and Luis Monterde, who owns a blueberry farm in Purvis, said some 100,000 pounds of blueberries rotted on the ground in the state this year because they couldn't find workers.\par \par \uc2 They said the E-Verify law has cut into the immigrant work force and contractors are no longer providing as many immigrant workers to pick crops.\par \par \uc2 "Here we are far from the Mexican border without a drug cartel in sight ... and we're considering adopting a law like Arizona's," Saucier said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100928e69s002e9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

JOHNSON   \par \uc2 AP Medical Writer\par \uc2 656 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 September 2010\par 16:51\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - In the midst of an economic downturn, Illinois children were slightly more likely to be covered by health insurance in 2009 than the year before, according to newly released U.S. Census Bureau figures.\par \par \uc2 The numbers suggest government safety net programs, including former Gov. Rod Blagojevich's "All Kids" expansion of coverage, are helping some children when parents lose benefits along with jobs.\par \par \uc2 The census data released Tuesday show the percentage of Illinois children with health insurance grew between 2008 and 2009, from about 94 percent to about 95 percent.\par \par \uc2 Macon County had the highest rate of uninsured children of the 23 largest counties in Illinois. The 2009 census data show nearly 14 percent of Macon County children were uninsured that year.\par \par \uc2 Among Macon County residents of all ages, about 15 percent were uninsured, the census data show, making it one of the highest county rates of uninsurance in the state, along with Cook and Kankakee counties. The overall rate of uninsurance in Illinois was 13.3 percent in 2009.\par \par \uc2 "We very much live paycheck to paycheck," said school bus driver Kim Bennett, 49, of Decatur in Macon County. "By the time we pay for everything, there isn't enough money left to get insurance."\par \par \uc2 The loss of manufacturing jobs in Macon County left many families without health coverage, said Barbara Dunn, executive director of the Community Health Improvement Center in Decatur. The county's high uninsurance rate for children will spur her health centers to be more aggressive in urging parents to cover their kids, she said.\par \par \uc2 "We are going to push them harder," Dunn said. "We're going to ask, why are they uninsured?"\par \par \uc2 Illinois was the first state to promise health insurance to all children. Blagojevich's expansion of insurance to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children and children whose family income is too high for traditional government insurance cost $70 million last year.\par \par \uc2 The children added under "All Kids" -- about 94,500 children in 2009 -- aren't eligible for federal funds, so the program's cost falls on state taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 The new census data show other states with child insurance rates as high or higher than Illinois. Massachusetts, the model for the new national health law, did the best with 98.5 percent of children insured.\par \par \uc2 Others with high rates of insurance for kids in 2009 were Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Iowa, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont.\par \par \uc2 In Illinois, depending on family income, parents can pay from zero to $300 per child per month for coverage under All Kids. A family of four making $72,000 a year can pay $140 a month for two or more children, or $70 a month for one child.\par \par \uc2 Some parents don't insure their children because they don't want to pay the premiums, said Dunn, who runs several safety net health clinics in central Illinois. Others neglect to do the paperwork or are embarrassed to sign up for a government program, she said.\par \par \uc2 At about 5 percent, Illinois' rate of uninsured children is far better than the national rate of 9 percent uninsured children in 2009.\par \par \uc2 "Illinois is proud to be among the top states in covering children, and is thrilled that the new data shows that 95 percent of all Illinois' children have health insurance of some kind," said Illinois Healthcare and Family Services Director Julie Hamos.\par \par \uc2 The figures come from the American Community Survey, which is sent to about 3 million households each year. The survey started asking about health coverage in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Nationally, the number of people covered by private health insurance fell from 201.0 million to 194.5 million from 2008 to 2009, according to the Census Bureau.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Post-Crescent, Appleton. Sept. 27, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Office of Lawyer Regulation made wrong decision\par \par \uc2 The Wisconsin Office of Lawyer Regulation announced late last week it will reconsider the complaint against Calumet County Dist. Atty. Ken Kratz.\par \par \uc2 That's good news to us because we think the office's first ruling on Kratz was a big mistake.\par \par \uc2 At the urging of the state Department of Justice, Kratz reported himself to the OLR after he sent text messages to a crime victim seeking a relationship with her in October 2009. At the time, Kratz was prosecuting her ex-boyfriend for a domestic violence incident.\par \par \uc2 On March 5, the woman received what must have been a disturbing letter from the OLR. It stated that while Kratz's behavior "was inappropriate, it did not appear to involve professional misconduct."\par \par \uc2 It told her no investigation would take place.\par \par \uc2 We're puzzled by that decision. It seems clear to most people in the state of Wisconsin that Kratz's text messages calling the woman a "hot, young nymph" would be the definition of misconduct.\par \par \uc2 Kratz's peers certainly think he didn't conduct himself properly. The Wisconsin District Attorneys Association called his behavior "repugnant" and asked him to resign.\par \par \uc2 If the OLR doesn't have a rule triggering disciplinary action against lawyers who do things like this, maybe it should.\par \par \uc2 Or maybe the panel just made a one-time mistake. We might never know because the office, which investigates complaints against lawyers and can discipline them, operates in secrecy.\par \par \uc2 Secrecy is important because not all complaints have merit. But we think the Office of Lawyer Regulation should have a different, more open set of procedures in cases against publicly elected district attorneys.\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Terese Berceau, D-Madison, called last week for a legislative audit of the office. She said Kratz's harassment is the definition of professional misconduct.\par \par \uc2 It looks to us like she's correct. Wisconsin's rules of professional conduct for attorneys states: "It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to harass a person on the basis of sex, race, age, creed, religion, color, national origin, disability, sexual preference or marital status in connection with the lawyer's professional activities."\par \par \uc2 It's time to take a look at the Office of Lawyer Regulation.\par \par \uc2 We're pleased it's reopening the Kratz complaint because other women have come forward with similar complaints, but that might not be enough.\par \par \uc2 Too many others have lost confidence in the office's role as a watchdog over attorneys.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Milwaukee \uc2 Journal Sentinel\uc2 . Sept. 21, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Dreams deferred\par \par \uc2 Having no say in the matter, they came as children with parents who were looking to do the work others wouldn't do. That children have been caught up in the tempest that is the immigration debate is just one of the many unsavory facets of this national discussion.\par \par \uc2 Their dream is to stay in the only country many of them know. As a matter of both compassion and national self-interest, Congress should have answered those dreams with passage of the DREAM Act ... But Senate Republicans, joined by a few Democrats, blocked the defense authorization bill to which it was attached from advancing.\par \par \uc2 So, both the DREAM Act and repeal of the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy are dead for the time being. That's just plain wrong in both instances.\par \par \uc2 In the DREAM Act's case, a coupling with a defense authorization bill might seem incongruous. Not so. The Pentagon knows that an all-volunteer force requires, well, volunteers. To be eligible, the act would have required people to finish high school, be of good moral character and serve at least two years in the military or earn a college degree before they could earn citizenship.\par \par \uc2 This is where national self-interest came in and why this amendment was a good fit. Personal advancement -- which will pay dividends for the country's productivity -- and service to country are part of the requirements here. That many would serve their country in the military if the DREAM Act passed is inescapable.\par \par \uc2 As a matter of compassion, it makes no sense to deny a path to legal residency or citizenship for youngsters who had no say in their arrival here. About 65,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students graduate from U.S. high schools every year.\par \par \uc2 The charge was that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat in a tight re-election contest in Nevada, added this to a defense bill to pander to the Latino vote in his state. As opposed, we guess, to a lack of desire for votes from members of Congress who have blocked this and comprehensive immigration reform generally.\par \par \uc2 One person's pandering is another's stand on principle. And there is plenty of principle to stand on here.\par \par \uc2 Congress had an opportunity to demonstrate principle, compassion and bipartisan pragmatism. Instead, we got gridlock as usual.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Marshfield News-Herald. Sept. 23, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Social pressure needed in fight against OWIs\par \par \uc2 We need tougher penalties for drunken drivers. We need more comprehensive treatment for those who are addicted to alcohol. We need more education programs on the dangers of alcohol, and more funding for programs, such as Safe Ride Home and Wood County's Pub Pilots, that help to keep those who've over-imbibed off the roadways.\par \par \uc2 At times we've agreed with all of those statements, and others. Although the debate about the plague of drunken driving, and the alcohol culture in Wisconsin, sometimes seems polarized -- penalties vs. treatment -- there's no inconsistency in advocating all of the above proposals and more.\par \par \uc2 But here is a thought: What if none of these institutional solutions can work without a hefty dose of social pressure? What if one key to ending drunken driving here really is a matter not just of individual responsibility but actually of simple peer pressure?\par \par \uc2 ... Gene Hilber, 45, of Merrill was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of OWI for the 13th time. Lincoln County Circuit Court Judge Jay Tlusty called the number "mind-boggling," and it is. Surely Hilber represents an extreme end of the spectrum: the drunken driver who won't stop, seemingly no matter what happens.\par \par \uc2 But we all know that there are many, many other repeat offenders who unrepentantly drive drunk without facing any consequences -- namely, those who haven't been arrested for it yet and those who haven't yet harmed anyone in a crash.\par \par \uc2 The reason this exists is because we let it. There are too many cases where, at the end of a Packers game or a night at a bar, we quietly look the other way as a friend who should not be driving gets behind the wheel to head home.\par \par \uc2 A Gannett Wisconsin Media report recently found that the three largest law enforcement agencies in the Wausau area are arresting fewer people for drunken driving since the stiffened penalties went into effect July 1.\par \par \uc2 That could mean fewer are driving drunk. But that's a leap, and even law enforcement leaders aren't willing to say that's what's going on. It also could mean people who are driving drunk aren't getting caught, and that's not as good.\par \par \uc2 There are other things that kill as many or more people as drunken driving. But every single drunken driving death is stupid and preventable. It's time to recognize that stopping them is going to take more than tougher laws, and more than beefed-up treatment. It's up to all of us to step up and take part in the effort.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100927e69r002zk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hearings set for this week at the state Capitol on immigration-enforcement proposals could be a preview of how contentious the topic will be next session.\par \par \uc2 Several lawmakers say they're interested in legislation that mirrors the immigration-enforcement law that took effect in Arizona this year. The statute requires law enforcement officers to check the status of people suspected of being in the country illegally. A federal judge's ruling, however, has put parts of the law on hold.\par \par \uc2 Senate Judiciary A Committee Chairman Joey Fillingane, R-Sumrall, who scheduled the hearings for Tuesday and Wednesday, said he wants to hear from proponents and detractors.\par \par \uc2 "I certainly think the folks who pushed the Arizona bill have a point. If there are illegal immigrants in our state, law enforcement should have the tools available to them to address the situation," Fillingane said. "There's also some strong arguments made by those who have legitimate concerns."\par \par \uc2 Nsombi Lambright, executive director of the state American Civil Liberties Union, said the immigration measure is nothing more than racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 Lambright, who will speak at the hearings, said she'll point to the Jackson City Council's approval last week of an anti-racial profiling ordinance as evidence there's not much appetite for the immigration proposal.\par \par \uc2 The city's ordinance prohibits law officers from questioning or arresting residents based solely on immigration status, physical characteristics, sexual orientation or gender identity. However, the ordinance doesn't apply if officers are looking for a suspect that fits a certain description.\par \par \uc2 The ordinance passed on a 6-1 vote by the majority-black council.\par \par \uc2 Lambright said she'd like to see other cities around the state follow Jackson's lead.\par \par \uc2 As for the immigration proposal, Lambright said it would only burden the state's law enforcement system.\par \par \uc2 No one has an exact figure for the state's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population, but few would argue it has grown over the years.\par \par \uc2 "We know if we have problems with law enforcement right now in terms of racial profiling, and not having racial sensitivity training, an immigration law like this would add extra problems to a system already flawed," Lambright said.\par \par \uc2 Fillingane said he will give the issue a thorough review.\par \par \uc2 Among those expected to appear at the hearings are Department of Public Safety Commissioner Steve Simpson; Rims Barber of the Mississippi Human Services Coalition; Mississippi NAACP President Derrick Johnson; Dr. Rodney Hunt, president of the Mississippi Federation for Immigration Reform and Enforcement; and Bill Chandler, executive director of the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance.\par \par \uc2 Hunt, a dentist, said he began educating himself "about the problems with illegal immigration" after federal officials brought an immigrant to him for treatment shortly after the terrorist attacks of 2001. Hunt said he later learned the man had been in the country for more than two years before he was taken into custody.\par \par \uc2 "My focus is really on jobs and social benefits," Hunt said. "There are thousands of jobs taken here by illegals that could go to residents."\par \par \uc2 Hunt said he's urging MFIRE supporters to contact House members to push for a floor vote on immigration legislation. In previous years, such bills often passed in the Senate, but died in House committees.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100927e69r000md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A poll published Sunday in five major Texas newspapers shows that more than half of the registered voters surveyed support legislation similar to a new Arizona law that cracks down on illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 According to the poll, 53 percent of 1,072 registered Texas voters said they supported passage of such legislation in Texas. That number is less than in previous polls.\par \par \uc2 Pollster Mickey Blum said the addition of the question of possible "racial profiling" as a consequence of such legislation might be the reason for the decrease. But, Blum said, "even having said those words -- 'racial profiling' -- in the question, you've got majority support for that type of law."\par \par \uc2 Thirty-eight percent were opposed to such legislation, while eight percent were uncertain and one percent refused to answer.\par \par \uc2 Also, the poll showed Texas voters almost evenly divided on whether to amend the U.S. Constitution to abolish automatic U.S. citizenship for all children born in the United States, even those whose parents were in the country illegally. Forty-five percent said they supported such an amendment, while 43 percent opposed it and 11 percent were uncertain and two percent refused to answer.\par \par \uc2 Blum & Weprin Associates Inc. of New York conducted the poll for the Houston Chronicle, The Dallas Morning News, the San Antonio Express-News, the Austin American-Statesman and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The results were appearing in their Sunday newspapers.\par \par \uc2 The telephone survey of a random sample of 1,443 Texas adults, including 1,072 registered voters and 629 likely voters, was conducted Sept. 15-22. The margin of error for the likely voters is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 The poll said that of those voters responding to the survey, 78 percent who described themselves as Republicans said they supported the Arizona-style bill, while 71 percent who described themselves as Democrats opposed it.\par \par \uc2 About two-thirds of the white respondents supported such legislation, even if it involved racial profiling, while about 75 percent of the Hispanic respondents and 60 percent of the black respondents opposed it.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Rick Perry has said such legislation would be inappropriate for Texas, but some Republican lawmakers have already introduced similar bills for the legislative session convening in January.\par \par \uc2 The newspapers interviewed some of the poll respondents.\par \par \uc2 Janet Kiekar, 55, of Missouri City, who said she lost her accounting job in the past year, supported Arizona-style legislation. She said the government must tighten immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "Not that I think a whole lot of illegal immigrants are taking away my accounting job, but they are taking somebody's job," she said.\par \par \uc2 Alfredo Lopez, 68, a San Antonio military veteran, opposed such legislation.\par \par \uc2 "I would hate for a police officer to stop me and ask me if I'm an American citizen when I can turn around and tell him, 'I think that I'm more American than you are. I'm the one that was out there dodging the bullets for 16 1/2 months in the foxholes, in the jungles, everything,'" he said.\par \par \uc2 When it came to a possible constitutional amendment to abolish automatic native-born citizenship, Walter Livingston of Burleson said he dislikes exploitation of so-called "birthright citizenship" by \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents.\par \par \uc2 "That is totally wrong," said the 69-year-old retired government weather forecaster. "Down the line, as long as they stay in the United States, they wind up getting all kinds of benefits that the taxpayers are paying for."\par \par \uc2 However, Del Rio service station cashier Marcy Reyes disagreed. Reyes, who said she supports Perry's re-election bid against Democrat Bill White, opposed a constitutional amendment.\par \par \uc2 "If they're born here, just because their parents aren't from here doesn't mean they're not American citizens. They should still be able to have a chance," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100926e69q002gl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - A professional organization for lawyers said Thursday it is drafting a misconduct complaint against the former attorney of a teenager from Ohio who ran away to Florida after converting to Christianity.\par \par \uc2 John Stemberger, an Orlando, Fla., lawyer, represented Rifqa Bary after she alleged her Muslim parents in suburban Columbus would harm her for converting.\par \par \uc2 The Florida Bar's grievance committee found enough evidence of alleged misconduct to prepare a complaint, said bar spokeswoman Karen Kirksey.\par \par \uc2 The bar looked into the matter after a formal complaint was filed with the group by Ohio lawyer Omar Tarazi, who represented Bary's parents in Ohio juvenile court.\par \par \uc2 Tarazi alleged Stemberger misrepresented himself as Bary's lawyer during Fox News interviews in December and January after Bary returned to Ohio and had new lawyers. Tarazi, who is Muslim, also accused Stemberger of alleging that Tarazi has terrorist ties.\par \par \uc2 The bar committee expects to file its complaint with the Florida Supreme Court this fall.\par \par \uc2 Stemberger on Thursday called Tarazi "the disgruntled opposing lawyer" in a high-profile politically and religiously charged case that Tarazi lost.\par \par \uc2 "Every public statement I made on Fox News was in good faith, based on facts known to be true, but have obviously been misconstrued," Stemberger said. "I have no doubt that, in time, this matter will be resolved in my favor and I will be fully exonerated."\par \par \uc2 Stemberger is also named in a $10 million federal defamation lawsuit Tarazi filed earlier this month raising some of the same complaints.\par \par \uc2 Stemberger called that lawsuit a frivolous publicity stunt and said he welcomed the chance to document his statements about Tarazi.\par \par \uc2 Tarazi applauded the Florida Bar for moving ahead, saying disparaging comments against any group, including Muslims, are not acceptable.\par \par \uc2 Bary ran away to Florida last year when she was still 16 with the help of Christian ministers she met on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . She said she could be hurt or killed because she converted to Christianity. Police investigations in Ohio and Florida did not find evidence she was in danger.\par \par \uc2 Stemberger represented Bary after Florida took custody of her. After authorities returned Bary to Ohio, she was represented by new attorneys while a juvenile court judge tried unsuccessfully to reconcile Bary and her family.\par \par \uc2 Bary, who was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Sri Lanka, left the custody of the county children's service agency after turning 18 last month. She received her green card a couple of weeks later. She has refused all interviews.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100923e69n0027x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- Five members of the 101st Airborne Division are among the nine American troops killed in a helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan, the military said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The five were assigned to the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, which deployed in March, said Fort Campbell spokesman Rick Rzepka.\par \par \uc2 The crash Tuesday was the worst coalition helicopter crash in Afghanistan in four years.\par \par \uc2 Killed from the 101st were Maj. Robert F. Baldwin, 39, of Muscatine, Iowa; Chief Warrant Officer Matthew G. Wagstaff, 34, of Orem, Utah; Chief Warrant Officer Jonah D. McClellan, 26; Staff Sgt. Joshua D. Powell, 25, of Pleasant Plains, Ill.; and Sgt. Marvin R. Calhoun Jr., 23, of Elkhart, Ind. The military said McClellan was from Minnesota; his father said his son grew up near Battle Ground, Wash.\par \par \uc2 The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. NATO said there were no reports of enemy fire at the time in the Daychopan district of Zabul province, where the crash took place.\par \par \uc2 However, the Taliban have claimed that insurgents shot down the helicopter. The Taliban often exaggerate their claims and sometimes take credit for accidents.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Ex-diplomat Baker says US must talk with enemies\par \par \uc2 FULTON, Mo. (AP) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker called Wednesday for a foreign policy approach that reflects the country's values yet is flexible, accepts undesirable allies and allows for communication with enemies.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at a private college in central Missouri, Baker also said the faltering national economy was affecting the country's relationships abroad.\par \par \uc2 He said sustained growth and reduced national debt were needed and warned that without improving the country's economic situation, "we will continue to see a drop in the standard of living for our citizens and our standing on the world stage will diminish."\par \par \uc2 Baker served as secretary of state for President George H.W.

(AP) -- Prosecutors have asked a judge to revoke bond for former Missouri running back Derrick Washington on a felony sexual assault charge after he was arrested last week on a domestic violence charge.\par \par \uc2 Associate Circuit Judge Deborah Daniels said she will consider the request on Thursday and ordered Washington to appear in court. A defense attorney pleaded not guilty on his behalf Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 If Daniels agrees with the request, Washington could be ordered to pay a higher bond or even sent to jail without a bond while awaiting trial.\par \par \uc2 The one-time Tiger captain is accused of entering a former Missouri tutor's closed bedroom while visiting her roommate and assaulting the woman in her sleep. Charges in that case were filed on Aug. 30, with Washington posting a $4,500 bond. Two days later, the 21-year-old senior was kicked off the team as Missouri prepared for its first football game that weekend.\par \par \uc2 Missouri agreed to let Washington keep his scholarship if he stayed in school. But school records show that he is no longer enrolled. On Sept. 14, Washington was charged with two counts of misdemeanor domestic assault after an ex-girlfriend said he hit her in the face five to 10 times and choked her during a late-night argument.\par \par \uc2 "He violated the terms and conditions of the bond when he was arrested in the new case," said assistant Boone County prosecutor Andrea Hayes. Christopher Slusher, Washington's attorney, declined to comment after the brief hearing.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Parton ending Dixie Stampede show in Myrtle Beach\par \par \uc2 MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.

The new pirate shows will start in June.\par \par \uc2 Parton's Dixie Stampede shows will continue in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., and Branson, Mo.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 APNewsBreak: Mo. arrests fewer illegal immigrants\par \par \uc2 JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The number of illegal immigrants arrested by Missouri troopers has fallen significantly in the three years since the state began checking the residency status of everyone booked into jail.\par \par \uc2 The Missouri State Highway Patrol turned up an average of one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  per day during the initial months after former Republican Gov. Matt Blunt ordered it to check the immigration status of everyone it incarcerated in August 2007, according to records obtained by The Associated Press under the state Sunshine Law.\par \par \uc2 But the number of illegal immigrants found by those checks declined by more than 40 percent in 2008 and an additional 30 percent 2009, according to the patrol records. It has leveled off at that lower rate this year.\par \par \uc2 Missouri's immigration-check requirement was a precursor to the more stringent and contentious Arizona law, parts of which have been placed on hold by a federal judge. The Arizona law requires police, while enforcing other laws, to question people's immigration status if there is a reasonable suspicion they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Missouri's gubernatorial directive was expanded to all police by a state law that took effect in August 2008 and has continued to be enforced since Democrat Jay Nixon became governor in 2009. But unlike the Arizona law, the Missouri measure applies only to people who already have been jailed -- not merely investigated -- for violating other laws.\par \par \uc2 Since the beginning of the mandatory status checks through Sept. 18, the Missouri State Highway Patrol incarcerated 602 people it determined were in the U.S. illegally. Well over half of those occurred in the first 16 months of the program, according to patrol records.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Big 12 teams lurking in national title mix\par \par \uc2 NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- When Big 12 football fans take a quick glimpse at the top of the rankings, there's something missing.\par \par \uc2 Three weeks into the season and with seven teams still undefeated, the conference doesn't have a team in the top 5. No. 6 Nebraska, No. 7 Texas and No. 8 Oklahoma are there waiting in the wings, but each has some work to do to get into the mix for the national championship.\par \par \uc2 The presence of No. 3 Boise State and No. 4 TCU has the Big 12 in an unusual situation. Not since 2006, when Texas and Oklahoma each suffered early losses, has the league failed to have a top 5 team in the AP poll three weeks into the season.\par \par \uc2 That could start sorting itself out after Texas and Oklahoma play in Dallas on Oct. 2 and the Longhorns visit Nebraska two weeks later. If any of those three teams are still unbeaten, the wins could result in a bump in the polls -- and in the BCS standings, when they come out Oct. 17.\par \par \uc2 "Long term, if you have an undefeated Big 12 team, there's no doubt in my mind they will finish ahead of Boise in the BCS and probably ahead in the polls," BCS analyst Jerry Palm said.\par \par \uc2 The same goes for TCU. With three teams in the top 10, there's enough power in the Big 12 that anyone who can run the table will move up over time.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Columbia drops dinner train accessibility demand\par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Columbia city officials have dropped demands that a proposed dinner train provide a handicapped-accessible dinner car after the owner threatened to abandon the project.\par \par \uc2 The City Council two weeks ago voted to give Central States Rail Associates two years to provide a fully accessible rail car. Company officials said the $175,000 cost probably would prevent the enterprise from moving forward.\par \par \uc2 The Columbia Daily Tribune reports that the Columbia Star Dinner Train is expected to begin service later this month, operating out of locomotives and rail cars that are 50 to 70 years old. The company says the Americans with Disabilities Act exempts historic rail cars from accessibility requirements.\par \par \uc2 The city's Disabilities Commission urged the city to reject the deal.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Columbia Daily Tribune, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.columbiatribune.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.columbiatribune.com}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Rockers Kansas carry on, play with college groups\par \par \uc2 STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- College students who weren't alive the last time the rock group Kansas had a hit are playing with the band on its latest tour -- a series of performances with university symphonies.\par \par \uc2 The '70s supergroup known for songs like "Dust in the Wind" and "Carry On Wayward Son" is touring several states to play with student musicians after what it thought was a one-time performance last year for its 35th anniversary. But the orchestra and band complemented each other so well a tour was born.\par \par \uc2 "If our music didn't fit so well symphonically we might give it a second thought, but it's a natural progression for symphonies and Kansas to play together," said drummer Phil Ehart, adding that the group "didn't have to do a lot of shoehorning to get the orchestra to fit."\par \par \uc2 The band whose members are now in their 50s and 60s released its first album in 1974 and had hits including "Point of Know Return," "People of the South Wind" and "All I Wanted," which in 1986 became its last major hit. "Even still today, those are songs that everybody should know," said 23-year-old Oklahoma State senior Colby Bunch, a drummer in the school's symphony who will play with Kansas on Thursday and Friday as part of the tour that includes stops in Alabama, Missouri, Texas and, of course, Kansas.\par \par \uc2 After Kansas played last year with the Washburn University symphony in Topeka, Kan. -- a concert that was recorded and sold as an album -- representatives of the group called schools to see if their symphonies would be interested in a joint show. The lure: an outside consultant would help raise funds for financially strapped music schools from donors at each university at which the band performed.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 KC children's project continues despite setback\par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Supporters of a project to provide health and education services for inner-city children in Kansas City say work will continue despite a major funding setback.\par \par \uc2 Kansas City was one of more than 300 groups that had applied for a Promise Neighborhoods grant from the Obama administration, but only 21 projects were awarded that funding. No projects in Kansas or Missouri were chosen for the grants, worth up to $500,000 each.\par \par \uc2 The Kansas City Star reports a coalition of community forces are trying to replicate New York's successful Harlem Children's Zone. Mayor Mark Funkhouser has been championing the project since returning from a trip to Harlem early last year.\par \par \uc2 The mayor says the work will continue, possibly with corporate and nonprofit funding.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Kansas City Star, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kcstar.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kcstar.com}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Egnew off to nice start at Missouri\par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri once again has found a go-to tight end.\par \par \uc2 Michael Egnew is second on the team in receptions (29) and yards (257) after three games. It's exactly what the junior envisioned when he was being recruited after watching the exploits of Chase Coffman and Martin Rucker.\par \par \uc2 Coffman caught 90 passes for 987 yards and 10 touchdowns in 2008 and won the John Mackey Award as the nation's top tight end. The previous year, Martin Rucker had 87 catches for 834 yards and eight scores.\par \par \uc2 Both players were NFL draft picks.\par \par \uc2 "I wanted to go to Mizzou from Day 1," Egnew said. "I remember in high school watching a game where they beat Texas Tech pretty handily and Chase was catching passes all over the field. I wanted to do the same thing."\par \par \uc2 The tight end virtually disappeared from the offense last season with Egnew and Andrew Jones combining for just 11 catches for 65 yards. Things are much different this year for the Tigers (3-0), who host Miami (Ohio) on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 MU professor wins $100,000 for BPA research\par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- A researcher at the University of Missouri-Columbia will receive a $100,000 cash prize for his research on a controversial plastic-hardener called BPA, or bisphenol (BIHS'-fen-ahl) A.\par \par \uc2 The Columbia Daily Tribune reports that Frederick vom Saal is one of 10 Heinz Awards recipients this year. The award recognizes people who are addressing environmental issues.\par \par \uc2 Vom Saal is a professor of biological sciences and has been studying the effects of BPA for more than a decade.\par \par \uc2 He has linked its use in baby products to abnormal cell development that has led to early puberty, diabetes and cancer.\par \par \uc2 Just this week, he and several other researchers published a new study that further warns of the health risks posed by BPA.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Groups discuss Mo. economic development ideas\par \par \uc2 JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.

Jay Nixon wants business, labor, education and other officials to help develop a plan for expanding Missouri's economy.\par \par \uc2 Nixon says there are important choices to be made about which new businesses and technologies to focus upon and what strategies to use for enticing economic development. Six local advisory groups are meeting across the state to offer their recommendations. Nixon spoke Wednesday to a panel focused on central Missouri.\par \par \uc2 The governor created the advisory committees earlier this year and wants preliminary recommendations by Dec. 1.\par \par \uc2 The local advisory groups report to a steering committee that will work with a four-person statewide board.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 NY firm to redo grounds around Gateway Arch\par \par \uc2 ST.

Organizers estimate the cost at $300 million, but say it could go higher.\par \par \uc2 The competition for the redesign began in December and drew about 50 teams.\par \par \uc2 The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Wednesday that MVVA's plans include a riverside plaza, an amphitheater and a bird sanctuary.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Flooding closes several Missouri highways\par \par \uc2 LEE'S SUMMIT, Mo.

A weekend storm that hit parts of the Kansas City area and north-central and northeast Missouri downed trees and left thousands without power.

LIEB   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 696 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 September 2010\par 18:18\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - The number of illegal immigrants arrested by Missouri troopers has fallen significantly in the three years since the state began checking the residency status of everyone booked into jail.\par \par \uc2 The Missouri State Highway Patrol turned up an average of one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  per day during the initial months after former Republican Gov. Matt Blunt ordered it to check the immigration status of everyone it incarcerated in August 2007, according to records obtained by The Associated Press under the state Sunshine Law.\par \par \uc2 But the number of illegal immigrants found by those checks declined by more than 40 percent in 2008 and an additional 30 percent 2009, according to the patrol records. It has leveled off at that lower rate this year.\par \par \uc2 Missouri's immigration-check requirement was a precursor to the more stringent and contentious Arizona law, parts of which have been placed on hold by a federal judge. The Arizona law requires police, while enforcing other laws, to question people's immigration status if there is a reasonable suspicion they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Missouri's gubernatorial directive was expanded to all police by a state law that took effect in August 2008 and has continued to be enforced since Democrat Jay Nixon became governor in 2009. But unlike the Arizona law, the Missouri measure applies only to people who already have been jailed -- not merely investigated -- for violating other laws.\par \par \uc2 Since the beginning of the mandatory status checks through Sept. 18, the Missouri State Highway Patrol incarcerated 602 people it determined were in the U.S. illegally. Well over half of those occurred in the first 16 months of the program, according to patrol records.\par \par \uc2 There were a couple sizable busts of illegal immigrants in 2007 and 2008. But the patrol hasn't changed its procedures nor its emphasis on conducting the immigration checks, said spokesman Lt. John Hotz.\par \par \uc2 "There's really no reason why the number of illegals has gone down from our perspective," Hotz said.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for immigrants and the Hispanic community say the decline may be due to the poor economy, which has led fewer people to come to the U.S. and to Missouri.\par \par \uc2 "People come here for jobs, and if there aren't jobs available, then they don't come in the same numbers," said Joan Suarez, chairwoman of the board of Missouri Immigrant and Refugee Advocates.\par \par \uc2 The number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. declined to an estimated 11.1 million in March 2009 from a peak of 12 million in March 2007, according to a study released earlier this month by the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington-based research organization.\par \par \uc2 The center estimated Missouri had 60,000 illegal immigrants, equating to 1 percent of the state's population. That ranks Missouri 43rd nationally in its per capita population of illegal immigrants -- a lower ranking than all of its neighboring states.\par \par \uc2 "Missouri was not, shall we say, a destination of choice to begin with for most undocumented immigrants coming to the country," said Jorge Riopedre, executive director of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan St. Louis. "If those numbers start to fall (nationally), I wouldn't be surprised to see Missouri fall."\par \par \uc2 Besides mandating immigration status checks on incarcerated people, the 2008 Missouri law also took several other steps to target illegal immigrants. It required people to prove they are U.S. citizens when applying for public benefits, and it required public employers and many government contractors to use a federal database that checks immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Missouri's laws on immigration-status checks may also be deterring some people from coming to the state or discouraging those already here from coming in contact with police, advocates for the Hispanic community said.\par \par \uc2 "Undocumented or mixed-status households and communities may be less likely to interact with police generally and try to stay under the radar -- even if they are witnesses or victims of crimes," said Elena Lacayo, the immigration field coordinator for National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy organization.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100922e69m001u0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A suspect in the execution-style killings of three college students in a New Jersey schoolyard in 2007 pleaded guilty Tuesday, days before his trial was set to begin.\par \par \uc2 Melvin Jovel, 21, pleaded guilty to three counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and weapons charges in the Newark attacks.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said Jovel and five other young men lined up Iofemi Hightower and Dashon Harvey, both 20, and 18-year-old Terrance Aeriel, against a schoolyard wall and shot each of them in the back of the head.\par \par \uc2 A fourth victim, who survived, testified at the first trial in the case that she was sexually assaulted, slashed with a machete and shot in the head. She is not being identified by The Associated Press because of the sexual assault charge.\par \par \uc2 "With this guilty plea today, the victim and the surviving family members are spared one trial and Mr. Jovel will spend the rest of his life behind bars," said Essex County Assistant Prosecutor Thomas McTigue. "We can now move on with the prosecution of the remaining cases."\par \par \uc2 The other four defendants are in jail awaiting trial.\par \par \uc2 Jovel faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced on Nov. 4. His lawyer, Joseph Krakora of the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, declined to comment on the plea.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors have portrayed the killings as an initiation ritual for members of the Central American gang MS-13. They say Jovel and at least two of the other suspects had lived in an apartment complex in Newark's Ivy Hill section across the street from the scene of the murders.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say the four victims, who attended or planned to attend Delaware State University, were hanging out listening to music in the schoolyard behind the Mount Vernon school on the night of Aug. 4, 2007, when they were approached by the suspects, who robbed them and forced them to lie on the ground.\par \par \uc2 Soon after, according to testimony of the survivor, three of them were led down a set of stairs and shot. The survivor said she saw Jovel's picture on TV while she was recovering in the hospital and remembered him as the person who shot her as he ran away from the scene.\par \par \uc2 The publicity surrounding the killings focused national attention on violent crime in New Jersey's largest city and jump-started anti-crime initiatives.\par \par \uc2 The killings also prompted state officials to give police the authority to refer violent crime suspects' names to immigration authorities if they are suspected of being in the country illegally, a response to the fact that one of the suspects was free on bail for other crimes despite being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Several of the suspects are Latin American immigrants of differing immigration status. Prosecutors said Tuesday that it wasn't clear whether Jovel, who was from Honduras, is in the United States legally or illegally.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, a jury convicted Rodolfo Godinez, a legal immigrant from Nicaragua, and sentenced him to three consecutive life sentences for the killings.\par \par \uc2 Godinez was not tied to the gun or machete used in the attacks but was convicted under New Jersey's accomplice liability law. His lawyer plans to appeal.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100921e69l001s6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Brown: DREAM Act amounts to 'amnesty' for illegal immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By RUSSELL CONTRERAS   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 786 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 September 2010\par 18:54\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - U.S. Sen. Scott Brown said Monday that a federal proposal to allow illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship through college or military service amounts to amnesty, and claimed that supporters of the measure were "playing politics with military funding."\par \par \uc2 The Massachusetts Republican said he was upset that the so-called DREAM Act might be included in a defense bill.\par \par \uc2 "I am opposed to illegal immigration, and I am deeply disappointed that Washington politicians are playing politics with military funding in order to extend a form of amnesty to certain illegal immigrants," Brown said in a statement, while undocumented students rallied outside his Boston office in support of the measure.\par \par \uc2 A member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Brown made the comments as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is seeking to add the legislation to a defense bill. Some military leaders who believe it would help with recruitment support the proposal. But some Republicans oppose it and are accusing Reid of playing politics.\par \par \uc2 Under the proposal, conditional legal status would be granted to young undocumented immigrants who successfully complete high school or the equivalent. They could qualify for permanent legal residency by enrolling in college or a trade school or by joining the military within six years.\par \par \uc2 A vote on the defense bill may come as early as Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Brown's comments come after months of pressure by student immigrant activists and various immigrant advocacy groups that wanted the senator to commit to passing a bill strongly supported by the man he replaced, the late-Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Democrat. Student activists have pushed letter writing campaigns and phone calls to Brown and staged protests and sit-ins outside his Boston office.\par \par \uc2 "He's missing the point. There are real people here," said Deivid Ribeiro, 21, an undocumented immigrant from Brazil and an aspiring astronaut. "He's the one who is playing politics by not addressing the issue. It's irresponsible of him."\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Ribeiro and a group of undocumented students launched a planned around-the-clock vigil and teach-in in front Brown's Boston office to press him on the DREAM Act.\par \par \uc2 Around 100 people from the Student Immigrant Movement and other immigrant groups marched from the Massachusetts Statehouse to the John F. Kennedy federal building, where Brown has an office, waving U.S. flags and singing songs. They arrived outside the federal building and vowed to stay until Brown announced his stance on the issue or the U.S. Senate took a vote.\par \par \uc2 "All I want is the opportunity to serve," said Carlos Savio Oliveira, 22, of Falmouth, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Brazil, who was brought to the U.S. by his parents when he was 8 years old. "I feel trapped."\par \par \uc2 Ribeiro said the group plans to hold teach-ins, as well, with volunteer professors at the protest site, reminiscent of the 1960s open forums that helped mobilize opposition to the Vietnam War.\par \par \uc2 Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., has promised to support the legislation.\par \par \uc2 Other student groups also coordinated similar protests outside lawmakers' offices in Chicago and Arizona.\par \par \uc2 In Boston, Ribeiro said students want to introduce Brown, a member of the Army National Guard, to Oliveira who said he would join the U.S. Navy if the proposal passed.\par \par \uc2 "For me, the Navy would only be the beginning," said Oliveira, who left for Washington, D.C., after Monday's launch to lobby other lawmakers.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) - On his upcoming album "Before the Dawn," Jamaican reggae star Buju Banton crows about standing strong, though battered and bruised, in the face of a gathering darkness.\par \par \uc2 The songs sound prophetic -- the four-time Grammy nominee recorded them before he was arrested on federal cocaine charges last December. The trial is scheduled to start Monday in Tampa -- a week before the album's U.S. release. He faces a possible life sentence if convicted.\par \par \uc2 "I've been accused, wrongly convicted. Jah knows I'm innocent," he sings in his gravelly voice, invoking the Rastafarian God. "I've been badly singled out by beloved friends ... who sold me out."\par \par \uc2 Banton recorded the album's 10 songs last year in Kingston, Jamaica, before his arrest at his Miami-area home on a charge of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. A grand jury indictment also charged him with carrying a firearm during the course of a drug trafficking crime.\par \par \uc2 He worked on the album with producers and engineers over the phone from Tampa-area jails, where the 37-year-old has been held without bail since the beginning of the year.\par \par \uc2 According to the indictment, Banton and an associate negotiated with an informant to buy the cocaine. Along with a third man, they allegedly met with an undercover officer in Sarasota in early December to buy the drugs. The informant told Drug Enforcement Administration agents that he also saw the singer inspecting the cocaine.\par \par \uc2 Ian Thomas, described by Banton's manager as an old friend of the singer who resurfaced shortly before the arrest, pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiracy to posses with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine. He now faces up to life in prison.\par \par \uc2 The third man, James Mack, has signed an affidavit stating that he never met Banton before his arrest, and that the singer did not know about the money or a gun that were in Mack's car during the drug deal. Mack plans to plead guilty to the drug conspiracy charge and a weapons charge, according to a plea agreement filed Wednesday. He also faces up to life in prison on each charge.\par \par \uc2 Both men agreed to testify for the prosecution as part of their plea agreements. Banton's attorney has requested Mack as a witness as well, according to court documents.\par \par \uc2 Banton's team will try to prove the singer, who rose from the slums of Kingston to massive success in the 1990s, was a victim of entrapment. Banton's attorney, David Markus, has said in court that the confidential informant has been paid $3.3 million for working with law enforcement over several years, including more than $35,000 in Banton's case. The informant met Banton, whose real name is Mark Myrie, in first class on a flight from Spain to Miami at the end of Banton's European tour last summer.\par \par \uc2 Banton's team contends that it was the informant who raised the idea of the cocaine deal with Banton.\par \par \uc2 "Paying a convicted drug trafficker millions of dollars for setting up an innocent productive member of society is wrong," Markus said in an e-mail. "The prosecution's star is laughing at all of us -- he doesn't pay taxes, he stopped paying the mortgage on his million dollar house, he doesn't pay his credit cards, and he gets to stay in this country even though he committed crimes here as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . We're hoping the jury will see through his charade."\par \par \uc2 Banton's arrest derailed plans to tour Japan after a tumultuous U.S. tour for his Grammy-nominated 2009 album, "Rasta Got Soul." Shows in several cities were canceled because of protests over violent, homophobic lyrics from early in Banton's career as a brash dancehall singer.\par \par \uc2 His manager, Tracii McGregor, has dismissed the controversy, saying those lyrics were written in response to a boy's rape in Jamaica, no longer represent Banton's subsequently more traditional reggae music and do not reflect his Rastafarian beliefs.\par \par \uc2 In 2003, a marijuana case in Jamaica resulted in a fine for Banton. The following year, he was acquitted on charges in Jamaica that he participated in the beating of six gay men.\par \par \uc2 He alludes to those problems -- and his current case, though he doesn't refer to it specifically -- in the liner notes to "Before the Dawn." He includes a note written in June from the Pinellas County jail urging fans to "stand firm through our adversities" and to "try life."\par \par \uc2 "Never before could I attest to the trauma experienced by others," Banton wrote, "but my current situation brings the full perspective of what bondage really means."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100919e69j001l1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BERLIN (AP) - Germany sought Friday to downplay a diplomatic incident involving French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the debate over his campaign to clear out illegal migrant camps reverberated across the European Union.\par \par \uc2 Sarkozy's attempts to defend his nation's policy against international complaints that France is being racist and unfairly targeting Gypsies threw a European Union summit into an uproar on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Sarkozy then asserted to reporters that Chancellor Angela Merkel had told him that Germany was on the verge of similar action.\par \par \uc2 Merkel's office was quick to deny that she told Sarkozy anything of the kind, but refused to be drawn on what the chancellor thought of the situation or what might have been behind Sarkozy's comments.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, French authorities have cleared out some 100 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  camps, most inhabited by Gypsies -- also known as Roma, a nomadic ethnic group believed to have roots in the Indian subcontinent.\par \par \uc2 Many have been deported to Romania, which joined the EU three years ago and has a sizable Roma population. Roma, like other EU citizens, are allowed to travel freely within the EU's open borders but all EU citizens must get work or residency papers to reside in a separate country.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to reporters after Thursday's summit, Sarkozy said "Madame Merkel indicated to me her will to proceed in the coming weeks with the evacuation of camps."\par \par \uc2 Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, flatly denied the chancellor had made any such remark, adding that the situation in Germany cannot be compared to that in France.\par \par \uc2 "We do not have camps like that," Seibert said at a regularly scheduled news conference. "It was not a topic."\par \par \uc2 Since the EU expanded its borders to the east, hundreds of thousands of Roma in the bloc's poorer nations have taken advantage of the continent's open borders to seek better lives in the west, despite facing equally desperate circumstances there.\par \par \uc2 There are up to 12 million Roma in the EU, most living in dire circumstances, victims of poverty, discrimination, violence, unemployment and bad housing.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week, EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding sharply criticized France's deportations of Roma and linked them to France's mass deportations of Jews during World War II. She later expressed regret over the wartime comparison, but maintained her threat to take France to court for targeting an ethnic group in the expulsions.\par \par \uc2 Germany criticized the tone of Reding's comments but has avoided comment on the expulsions themselves.\par \par \uc2 The wartime comparison stung many in France. The country deported some 76,000 Jews from France to Nazi concentration camps and interned thousands of Gypsies in camps in France during the war.\par \par \uc2 Also Friday, a group of angry French Roma tussled with police in Draguignan, in southern France, after a gendarme was acquitted in the 2008 slaying of 27-year-old Joseph Guerdner, who fled police custody.\par \par \uc2 Guerdner was from a community of itinerant Roma with roots in France reaching back centuries.\par \par \uc2 ------------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Angela Charlton contributed to this report from Paris\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100917e69h0010n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OXFORD, Miss. (AP) - University of Mississippi student Patricia Pacheco is facing deportation because she is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Growing up poor with a single mother in southern Florida, she knew she couldn't afford a car, but she at least wanted a driver's license. That was when her mother revealed an astonishing family secret.\par \par \uc2 The Commercial Appeal reports Pacheco couldn't get a driver's license, she learned, because she and her mother were illegal immigrants. They had come to the United States from Brazil when Pacheco was 7, in September 1995.\par \par \uc2 "I never thought I was any different," she said. "It hurt our relationship a lot. It just ruined things. I don't hate her. But I hate that she did this and didn't try to make things right sooner."\par \par \uc2 Pacheco's own actions -- not her mother's -- have resulted in a Sept. 28 deportation hearing at the Memphis field office of the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 "She probably could've rocked along for years without anyone noticing," said Jack Richbourg, her lawyer, who has handled immigration cases in Memphis since 1997. "But she tried to do what she thought was right."\par \par \uc2 Five years ago, the 22-yedar-old Pacheco confessed her status and asked for asylum. Asylum is a safe haven the United States offers immigrants who face persecution in their native country on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.\par \par \uc2 "We know that Brazil is civilized. It isn't Pakistan," Richbourg told the newspaper.\par \par \uc2 Richbourg said Pacheco has only two relatives in Brazil -- grandparents in their 80s who live outside of Rio de Janeiro -- and she speaks Portuguese, the national language there, at a kindergarten level.\par \par \uc2 Her asylum request put her on the Department of Homeland Security's radar.\par \par \uc2 She enrolled in Ole Miss -- where she majors in business management with hopes of law school -- while her status was being processed.\par \par \uc2 Because illegal immigrants are ineligible for financial aid, she has been paying full out-of-state tuition -- $10,000 per semester -- thanks to benefactors from her hometown.\par \par \uc2 "It's tragic that the mother is the one who evaded the law, and this young woman who embraced the system is the one facing deportation. The fact that she didn't know she was undocumented is common. We take our parents' word for things like that," said Michael Olivas, a law professor at the University of Houston.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Commercial Appeal, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.commercialappeal.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.commercialappeal.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100916e69g001ca\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BRUSSELS (AP) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy upended a European Union summit to defend his own nation's honor, vowing Thursday to keep clearing out \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  camps despite accusations that France is being racist and unfairly targets Gypsies.\par \par \uc2 The summit was supposed to be a forum for molding a unifying European foreign policy, but it turned into a drama of discord -- with the outspoken Sarkozy usurping the podium to preach his policies and lash out at his critics.\par \par \uc2 Sarkozy said comments by EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding that linked the expulsions to the mass deportations of World War II were "disgusting."\par \par \uc2 "I am head of the French state. I cannot let my nation be insulted," Sarkozy told reporters.\par \par \uc2 The wartime comparison stung many in France and other members of a bloc designed to overcome and prevent the kind of hostilities that divided Europe in the past. France deported some 76,000 Jews from France to Nazi concentration camps, and interned thousands of Gypsies in camps in France during the war.\par \par \uc2 Sarkozy insisted France's expulsions of Gypsies, or Roma, are a matter of security and said France doesn't have to take lessons from anyone, as long as it respects human rights. He called more than 100 Roma camps dismantled in France in recent weeks havens of crime and undignified living conditions.\par \par \uc2 "We will continue to dismantle the illegal camps, whoever is there," Sarkozy said. "Europe cannot close its eyes to illegal camps."\par \par \uc2 Participants at the summit lunch said emotions flared between Sarkozy and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso over the expulsions. Barroso did not want to comment on his exchange with Sarkozy, brushing off "useless rhetoric or unnecessary controversies."\par \par \uc2 "Let's put this behind us, let's work now on substance," he said.\par \par \uc2 Sarkozy downplayed the exchange. "If there is someone who keeps his calm, and abstains from excessive comments, it is surely me," said the French leader -- who has a reputation for having a volatile temper.\par \par \uc2 Britain, so often at loggerheads with France over all issues European, backed Sarkozy.\par \par \uc2 "Members of the Commission have to chose their language carefully as well," said Cameron, a fellow member of the center-right. He added that "you should, of course have the right to remove people from your country if they are there illegally."\par \par \uc2 Reding's office has said she expressed regret over the wartime comparison, but maintained her threat to take France to court for targeting an ethnic group in the expulsions.\par \par \uc2 "All heads of state and government said it was profoundly shocking that one would speak in this way, with historical references that were deeply hurtful to the entirety of our compatriots," Sarkozy said.\par \par \uc2 "It is an insult, an injury, a humiliation and an outrage," Sarkozy said, the kind of comment rarely heard about any of the EU's top officials.\par \par \uc2 The expulsions of more than 1,000 Roma from France in recent weeks, mainly to Romania, have also highlighted persistent divisions between richer, older EU members and poorer, newer ones.\par \par \uc2 Romanian President Traian Basescu accused EU leaders of "hypocrisy" over the Roma expulsions to his country, and warned that those expelled from France may quickly return.\par \par \uc2 "If we are not honestly recognizing this reality, we will not find solutions," he told reporters in Bucharest.\par \par \uc2 While Thursday's tensions centered on the Roma, the EU leaders talked little about them, a group that is among the continent's poorest, most mistreated minorities.\par \par \uc2 "What political power do the Roma have in Europe?" Asked Florin Manole of the Center for Roma Studies at Bucharest University. "I doubt things will change, especially as we have an economic crisis."\par \par \uc2 Beyond the Roma issue, the government leaders did find unity on some other issues.\par \par \uc2 They agreed to temporarily waive World Trade Organization tariffs on key Pakistani imports to help boost the flood-devastated country's economy.\par \par \uc2 The EU already has committed millions of euros in humanitarian aid to help Pakistan recover from the devastation. It also wanted to craft a long-term strategy to help the country get its economy back on track amid fears Islamic extremists could exploit the crisis to strengthen their hold on northwestern regions close to the border with Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 The EU also agreed Thursday to a free trade pact with South Korea that will slash billions of dollars in industrial and agricultural duties, despite some countries' worries that the auto industry could be hurt by a flood of cheaper cars.\par \par \uc2 The deal -- the first such pact between the EU and an Asian trading partner -- will be signed at an EU-South Korea summit on Oct. 6 and come into force on July 1, 2011, said Belgian Foreign Minister Steven Vanackere, whose country holds the union's rotating presidency.\par \par \uc2 However, it first has to be approved by the EU and South Korean parliaments and European carmakers are still hoping lawmakers will ensure safeguards for their industry.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Mike Corder in Brussels and Alison Mutler in Bucharest contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100916e69g000eb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - An Arizona sheriff whose county is at the end of a smuggling corridor between Tucson and Phoenix is calling for more federal help to battle the problem, but he made the call as he tried to persuade his own county to give him money to create an anti-smuggling unit of his own.\par \par \uc2 Smugglers are making the rugged mountains near some rural residents homes' too dangerous, Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said Wednesday, repeating his call for thousands of federal troops to battle the problem that he said is falling on deaf ears.\par \par \uc2 Residents of the rugged area south of Arizona City, about 60 miles south of Phoenix, told how they saw a spotter for smugglers living in a mountain cave overlooking their land in July. The sheriff's office called the U.S. Border Patrol, who Babeu said found the man, determined he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and deported him. Babeu also highlighted a resident whose home was burglarized, presumably by smugglers or illegal immigrants, last week.\par \par \uc2 The problems aren't new, and President Barack Obama announced in May that he was deploying 1,200 National Guard troops to four border states to help the Border Patrol. In Arizona, troops began deploying at the beginning of September and more than 500 are expected to be on duty by Oct. 1.\par \par \uc2 That's not enough for Babeu, who criticized Obama while pointing to pictures of signs warning residents not to stray into the backcountry.\par \par \uc2 "Here's the response when we ask for help from the federal government: 'danger, warning, stay out' to our own citizens," Babeu said. "In response to our pleas for help and for armed soldiers they put up these signs, not written in Spanish, not facing south to the Mexican border, but facing north, in English, warning to our citizens, 'travel not recommended.'\par \par \uc2 "This is unacceptable. These signs need to be taken down and we need to make a stand here in America."\par \par \uc2 Kelly Ivahnenko, spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Washington, said the federal government has poured "unprecedented resources" into the Border Patrol's Tucson sector and continues to add to those numbers, along with help from other federal agencies and prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 That said, "The challenges remain," Ivahnenko said. "The terrain is challenging and the geography is challenging and there is no single solution, which is why the Department of Homeland Security has made such a concerted effort to get additional resources to that area."\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's press conference came the same day that The Arizona Republic ran a story about his county's Board of Supervisors balking at immediately funding seven extra deputy position to tackle smuggling issues.\par \par \uc2 Pinal County board chairman Pete Rios said Babeu made his request for $1.5 million over two years just weeks after the county's fiscal year began.\par \par \uc2 "Now he's basically saying that's it's very urgent and it's an emergency," Rios told The Associated Press. "Well, he just submitted his budget not too long ago, we just got into this fiscal year, and we kind of, especially me, said if it was such an urgent thing why didn't you include it in your budget request?"\par \par \uc2 Babeu suggests the county take the money from its $29 million 'rainy day' fund, which helps the county keep its A-plus bond rating and plan for expected state funding shifts.\par \par \uc2 Rios called the press conference a distraction from trying to get funding for the sheriff's unit. He called for the sheriff to meet face-to-face rather than communicate in the media.\par \par \uc2 "Clearly, my dear sheriff, as much as I like him, loves the publicity and I think that's what we're experiencing," Rios said. "Anything that he can turn into a publicity event is clearly what he's doing."\par \par \uc2 Regardless of the politics, the local residents who spoke Wednesday wanted the public to know they were genuinely fearful of the smugglers who have become so prevalent in the area. In April, a Pinal County deputy was slightly wounded during a reported confrontation with smugglers in the corridor that runs through a southern Arizona Indian reservation and into Pinal County.\par \par \uc2 Pennee Murphree's home is below the mountain cave where the suspected smuggling spotter was living for about a week before she and her neighbors finally called deputies for help. She said it was scary knowing he was up there watching their every move.\par \par \uc2 "We do want the public to know it's close, and it's real, and there's a criminal element there," Murphree said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100916e69g000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - An Arizona sheriff whose county is at the end of a smuggling corridor between Tucson and Phoenix is calling for more federal help to battle the problem, but he made the call as he tried to persuade his own county to give him money to create an anti-smuggling unit of his own.\par \par \uc2 Smugglers are making the rugged mountains near some rural residents homes' too dangerous, Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said Wednesday, repeating his call for thousands of federal troops to battle the problem that he said is falling on deaf ears.\par \par \uc2 Residents of the rugged area south of Arizona City, about 60 miles south of Phoenix, told how they saw a spotter for smugglers living in a mountain cave overlooking their land in July. The sheriff's office called the U.S. Border Patrol, who Babeu said found the man, determined he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and deported him. Babeu also highlighted a resident whose home was burglarized, presumably by smugglers or illegal immigrants, last week.\par \par \uc2 The problems aren't new, and President Barack Obama announced in May that he was deploying 1,200 National Guard troops to four border states to help the Border Patrol. In Arizona, troops began deploying at the beginning of September and more than 500 are expected to be on duty by Oct. 1.\par \par \uc2 That's not enough for Babeu, who criticized Obama while pointing to pictures of signs warning residents not to stray into the backcountry.\par \par \uc2 "Here's the response when we ask for help from the federal government: 'danger, warning, stay out' to our own citizens," Babeu said. "In response to our pleas for help and for armed soldiers they put up these signs, not written in Spanish, not facing south to the Mexican border, but facing north, in English, warning to our citizens, 'travel not recommended.'\par \par \uc2 "This is unacceptable. These signs need to be taken down and we need to make a stand here in America."\par \par \uc2 Kelly Ivahnenko, spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Washington, said the federal government has poured "unprecedented resources" into the Border Patrol's Tucson sector and continues to add to those numbers, along with help from other federal agencies and prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 That said, "The challenges remain," Ivahnenko said. "The terrain is challenging and the geography is challenging and there is no single solution, which is why the Department of Homeland Security has made such a concerted effort to get additional resources to that area."\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's press conference came the same day that The Arizona Republic ran a story about his county's Board of Supervisors balking at immediately funding seven extra deputy position to tackle smuggling issues.\par \par \uc2 Pinal County board chairman Pete Rios said Babeu made his request for $1.5 million over two years just weeks after the county's fiscal year began.\par \par \uc2 "Now he's basically saying that's it's very urgent and it's an emergency," Rios told The Associated Press. "Well, he just submitted his budget not too long ago, we just got into this fiscal year, and we kind of, especially me, said if it was such an urgent thing why didn't you include it in your budget request?"\par \par \uc2 Babeu suggests the county take the money from its $29 million 'rainy day' fund, which helps the county keep its A-plus bond rating and plan for expected state funding shifts.\par \par \uc2 Rios called the press conference a distraction from trying to get funding for the sheriff's unit. He called for the sheriff to meet face-to-face rather than communicate in the media.\par \par \uc2 "Clearly, my dear sheriff, as much as I like him, loves the publicity and I think that's what we're experiencing," Rios said. "Anything that he can turn into a publicity event is clearly what he's doing."\par \par \uc2 Regardless of the politics, the local residents who spoke Wednesday wanted the public to know they were genuinely fearful of the smugglers who have become so prevalent in the area. In April, a Pinal County deputy was slightly wounded during a reported confrontation with smugglers in the corridor that runs through a southern Arizona Indian reservation and into Pinal County.\par \par \uc2 Penny Murphy's home is below the mountain cave where the suspected smuggling spotter was living for about a week before she and her neighbors finally called deputies for help. She said it was scary knowing he was up there watching their every move.\par \par \uc2 "We do want the public to know it's close, and it's real, and there's a criminal element there.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100915e69f002ek\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The 32-year-old was arrested in March in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, at the request of the United States.\par \par \uc2 Puello faces U.S. charges in Vermont for allegedly smuggling illegal immigrants through Canada. He remains in custody in the Burlington area while awaiting a court hearing scheduled for Friday, Gerke said.\par \par \uc2 Puello, who was born in New York and holds dual U.S.-Dominican citizenship, has said he is innocent of all accusations.\par \par \uc2 The charges are not related to his involvement with the 10 U.S. Baptists who were detained in Haiti on child-kidnapping charges in February. He initially provided them with food, medicine and legal assistance but was later accused of absconding with $30,000 in legal fees meant for another lawyer.\par \par \uc2 All the missionaries have been released from a Haitian jail and returned to the U.S.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100914e69e001xe\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc93}{\*\bkmkend toc93}\b \uc2 LA protests over police killing highlight frustration of immigrant area hardhit by recession\b0\par\par\uc2 By CHRISTINA HOAG   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,043 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 September 2010\par 10:05\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - The smell of corn roasting on sidewalk grills, the oompah beat of Latin music blasting from mom-and-pop stores, colorful signs touting tongue-twisting names like Atitlan and Quetzaltenango.\par \par \uc2 This central Los Angeles neighborhood could almost be plucked right out of Guatemala City.\par \par \uc2 Long ago a well-heeled area of Los Angeles, in more recent decades the Westlake district surrounding MacArthur Park has become a densely packed enclave of Central American immigrants fleeing brutal civil wars and grinding poverty in their home countries.\par \par \uc2 This week, the bustling community turned into a hotbed of unrest after a police officer shot and killed a Guatemalan day laborer who allegedly lunged at him with a knife. The incident Sunday sparked three days of protests by people who felt that killing Manuel Jaminez, a 37-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was an unfair and unnecessary use of police force.\par \par \uc2 The demonstrations surprised officials, who blamed the blowback on outsiders who had come to the area to stir up trouble. A visit to the neighborhood of grimy tenements with curlicued cornices and portals that belie a more elegant past reveals a social tapestry fraying from increasingly hardscrabble living and widespread frustration.\par \par \uc2 "Life is very hard here," said Ricardo Fernandez, a retired Nicaraguan truck driver. "I tell people not to come, it's not as good as before. But people still come."\par \par \uc2 The neighborhood has long been a first stop for new arrivals who have made the risky journey to "el Norte." More than two-thirds of residents are foreign-born, almost three-quarters are Hispanic, almost half live in poverty.\par \par \uc2 Drawn to a neighborhood with flavors of home, about 118,000 residents jam the area's 2.7 square miles, making it one of the most crowded districts in Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 Here, they find everything from comfort foods such as tamales and \uc2 Pollo Campero\uc2  -- Central America's beloved fast-food fried chicken chain -- to fake Social Security cards and driver's licenses to cheap lodging in shared bedrooms and living rooms.\par \par \uc2 But they often find it fails to live up to the starry-eyed stories told by friends and relatives eager to appear big shots with their U.S. success.\par \par \uc2 Jobs are few and far between, rents are high, and unfamiliar laws are stringently enforced. Crime is also high, with much of it related to the neighborhood's homegrown Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13, a gang formed by Salvadoran immigrants in the 1980s that has morphed into one of the most vicious in the nation.\par \par \uc2 Particularly vulnerable are campesinos, subsistence farmers from the indigenous communities of rural Mexico and Guatemala who often are far less prepared to cope than other immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Many have only a few years of formal schooling and may barely be able to read and write. Some speak little Spanish, having grown up in isolated areas where native indigenous languages are mainly spoken.\par \par \uc2 Jaminez was a Quiche, one of Guatemala's largest indigenous groups, and barely spoke Spanish.\par \par \uc2 "They're the ones I see coming now. They're not poor, they're destitute," said Carolina Sosa, a Guatemalan pastor. "Before it was the lower middle class fleeing the guerrillas. Now, they're coming because they don't have food."\par \par \uc2 The recession coupled with the backlash against immigrants has toughened life for newcomers.\par \par \uc2 Apartments are often crowded with several families sharing rent. To eke out a living, many have taken to peddling everything from bootleg DVDs to bacon-wrapped sausages, turning the sidewalks into a chaotic flea market on evenings and weekends.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot more people in the street selling," said Andres Morales, a Cuban retiree. "It gets so you can't walk on the sidewalk, but they have nothing else."\par \par \uc2 In Latin American countries, street peddling is a ubiquitous and time-honored way of getting by when jobs are few and government assistance is scarce. Immigrants have a hard time understanding why it is illegal here and they resent crackdowns by police who give out $250 tickets and sometimes confiscate their goods.\par \par \uc2 "I'm making an honest living, but the police come and ticket us," complained Jose Venegas, a Mexican ice cream seller who makes $12 to $15 a day. "I have two appointments in court for two tickets. I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't have the money to pay the fines. I'm going to go to jail."\par \par \uc2 The stress of trying to make ends meet plus social and emotional isolation leads some to seek refuge in alcohol. Jaminez had been drinking when he allegedly menaced two women and then police officers with a knife.\par \par \uc2 Residents said public drinking is out of control.\par \par \uc2 The neighborhood has seen progress. Police have driven gangs out of MacArthur Park and have worked to build trust with the illegal immigrants so they'll report crime, said Councilman Ed Reyes, who represents the area. Street peddlers said that although gangs still extort "taxes," the problem is less serious than it used to be because of stepped-up police presence.\par \par \uc2 Still, many remain suspicious of law enforcement. On top of the common perception they bring from home countries of corrupt, inept cops, Westlake has had its own prickly police history.\par \par \uc2 The area was home to the 1990s Rampart scandal, where police officers were accused of planting evidence on suspects among other wrongdoing. A May Day immigrant rights rally in MacArthur Park descended into chaos when police fired rubber bullets and bludgeoned reporters and peaceful demonstrators three years ago.\par \par \uc2 In the wake of the protests, Reyes plans to start a micro-loan program for fledgling entrepreneurs and work with Guatemalan organizations to educate immigrants about assimilating into U.S. society.\par \par \uc2 Despite the hardship, most immigrants don't want to go home. Tomas Gomez, Jaminez's brother-in-law, said that although day laborer jobs had dried up considerably and Jaminez pined for his wife and three young sons, he did not want to go back to Guatemala.\par \par \uc2 Here, at least there was a chance to make a living, Gomez said. Back home, "he didn't have money to eat."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100911e69b000rw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Amid the poverty and chronic joblessness, some residents say, officers mistreated them and were overly harsh in their enforcement of city ordinances.\par \par \uc2 "They are messing with people all the time," said Juan Lorenzo, a day laborer who knew Jamines.\par \par \uc2 Lorenzo claimed the officer who shot Jamines -- Frank Hernandez -- was disliked by many in the community because he would often ticket people for selling food on the street and would sometimes throw the food in the trash.\par \par \uc2 Beyond complaints from several residents about the police conduct, there were no easy answers to explain why the community has reacted with such anger over the shooting.\par \par \uc2 The neighborhood just west of downtown has been cleaned up in recent years, most notably with police reclaiming MacArthur Park, a recreation area that was once a no-go zone to all but gang members and drug dealers.\par \par \uc2 Now, day laborers wait for construction jobs that sometimes don't come for days on end.\par \par \uc2 On the corner where Jamines was killed, outside the parking lot next to a 99-cent store, a newspaper box was turned into a memorial. A heart-shaped bouquet was tied to the box and a photo of Jamines was taped alongside.\par \par \uc2 Lozano, also from Guatemala, leaned against a metal railing on the corner.\par \par \uc2 He said he did not believe the police account of the shooting and said officers had planted a knife near Jamines's body. He had no proof, but said the folding weapon looked more like the kind of tactical blade a police officer would carry.\par \par \uc2 Chief Charlie Beck and other officials have blamed outside radical groups, including the Revolutionary Communist Party, of stirring up anger and provoking the rioting.\par \par \uc2 Mike Prysner, an organizer with activist group the Answer Coalition, said the anger is endemic to the community.\par \par \uc2 "It's a common tactic by the police to try to blame community outrage on outside agitators," Prysner said. "In reality the outside agitators were the police who came into the community and attacked peaceful vigils."\par \par \uc2 Still, Prysner acknowledged that activists do play a role in helping residents express their frustrations.\par \par \uc2 Members of a different activist group on Thursday produced for the media a woman who said she witnessed the shooting and who presented a version of events at odds with what other witnesses told police.\par \par \uc2 The woman, who only gave her first name Ana, said she was out shopping on Sunday and, from her vantage point on the sidewalk across the street, saw Jamines get shot.\par \par \uc2 Contrary to accounts from six other witnesses, she said, Jamines was not holding a knife.\par \par \uc2 "The police said 'drop the weapon,' and the man looked at them like he'd been drinking," she said in Spanish. "But he was holding nothing, absolutely nothing."\par \par \uc2 Police Capt. Kris Pitcher, who is overseeing the shooting investigation, said Ana had been identified at the scene but detectives had not yet interviewed her.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez, who has been placed on administrative leave after the shooting, was involved in as many as three earlier shootings, Capt. Pitcher said.\par \par \uc2 The Los Angeles Times first reported that he shot a female robbery suspect in 1999 when the woman allegedly pointed a handgun at Hernandez and his partner and refused orders to drop the weapon. Her injury was not life-threatening.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, the Times reported, Hernandez shot an 18-year-old assault suspect who tried to flee, then pointed a gun at Hernandez and another officer. Hernandez shot the man once, wounding him.\par \par \uc2 Tomas Gomez, the brother-in-law of Jamines, said his relative came from a tiny hamlet in the rugged mountainous region of western Guatemala, the province of Solola, where he was married and had three young sons, the oldest of whom is eight.\par \par \uc2 Gomez said life was a struggle for Jamines and his family, whose native language is Quiche, one of about 20 Mayan dialects spoken in Guatemala. He only spoke a little Spanish and no English.\par \par \uc2 "They didn't have enough to eat," Gomez said.\par \par \uc2 Jamines decided to seek work in the U.S. a little more than five years ago. Another brother in law and Gomez came later.\par \par \uc2 Here he worked as a day laborer, mainly doing construction odd jobs, which he obtained at the local \uc2 Home Depot\uc2 . Jamines rented a room in an apartment near the \uc2 Home Depot\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At times, he felt trapped and grew sad at being so far from his family, Gomez said. "He didn't have the money to go back, he wasn't getting a lot of work here," he said. "There were weeks when he wouldn't get any work."\par \par \uc2 Jamines liked to drink beer on the weekends, and was a drinker back in Guatemala, too.\par \par \uc2 Gomez said Jamines was not aggressive or violent. He had never seen him with a knife. He said he believes the police are inventing the story about the knife to justify killing Jamines.\par \par \uc2 "That's a falsehood by the police," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Christina Hoag in Los Angeles and Juan Carlos Llorca in Guatemala contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100909e6990001s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

LOZANO   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 490 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 September 2010\par 17:17\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOMBALL, Texas (AP) - A Houston suburb is stepping into the fray over illegal immigration as it considers banning illegal immigrants from renting property or owning businesses and making English its official language.\par \par \uc2 The Tomball City Council was scheduled to debate several controversial ordinances Tuesday night that would also prevent illegal immigrants from owning property or operating any business. Another proposal calls for mandating that any company awarded a city contract not hire illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 City leaders also were to discuss the future of a city-run day labor site that some critics say is being used by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The proposed ban on renting to illegal immigrants is similar to an ordinance in Farmers Branch that the Dallas suburb has tried for years to enforce. A federal judge ruled the ordinance unconstitutional in March, and Farmers Branch is appealing.\par \par \uc2 Tomball City Councilman Derek Townsend, who is proposing the ordinances, said he fully supports immigration as long as it's legal. Critics are calling his proposals racist and reactionary.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a race issue whatsoever. It has nothing to do with race. It has to do with what's legal and what's not legal," Townsend said ahead of Tuesday's meeting. "If you come here legally, you have every right to the American dream, but otherwise pack your stuff up and go home."\par \par \uc2 He said he's against those who would come into the country illegally and reap all the benefits of living in the United States without paying their fair share of taxes.\par \par \uc2 David Smith, a spokesman for the Progressive Workers Organizing Committee, a Houston-area labor group, said he is outraged by the proposals.\par \par \uc2 "This is all about race and racism," said Smith, who teaches government at a community college near Houston. "Tomball has historically been a white community. It is experiencing demographic shifts. For most, this is a wonderful thing. But there is a reaction among some folks in Tomball to the changing demographics."\par \par \uc2 According to 2000 U.S. Census figures, Tomball's population of 10,000 was about 87 percent white and 12 percent Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 Smith said he planned to detail at Tuesday's meeting how similar ordinances around the country, including those in Farmers Branch, Fremont, Neb. and Hazleton, Pa., have cost their communities millions of dollars in legal fees and are usually declared unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's controversial immigration law is also being challenged in court. It requires police officers while enforcing other laws to ask individuals about their immigration status if there is "reasonable suspicion" that they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Townsend said he doesn't expect his proposals will pass, but he hopes they will bring light to an issue that has frustrated many Americans and prompt residents to demand action from their political leaders.\par \par \uc2 "I've just had enough of giving our country away," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100907e697002kd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Tulsa World. Sept. 6, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Latest outbreak\par \par \uc2 When it comes to watching client accounts, financial institutions cannot do it alone. That became apparent last week with a new round of debit card fraud at several local credit unions.\par \par \uc2 Now, debit card holders are being warned to monitor their accounts and be on guard for fraudulent charges.\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Oklahoma Central Credit Union\uc2 , debit card fraud starting showing up in some member accounts Aug. 27 and continued into the following weekend. So far, less than 1 percent of the credit union's membership has been affected but if you're among that 1 percent the problems created a headache and the need to block some debit card accounts. In turn, some customers had to order new cards and were unable to use their cards to make purchases or get cash.\par \par \uc2 Generally, if accounts are compromised the financial institution will restore the amount of a fraudulent purchase back into the account so the client won't be out of any money. But such fraud can cause a great deal of inconvenience and anxiety for the customer as well as the financial institution.\par \par \uc2 Typically credit unions don't see much fraudulent activity but in the most recent rash of activity, electronic con artists are moving from institution to institution.\par \par \uc2 These problems will pass. In an electronic age, no financial institution is totally immune from such problems. In the meantime, however, customers should check their accounts closely.\par \par \uc2 The sooner your financial institution becomes aware of irregularities the sooner it can start taking steps to minimize the damage.\par \par \uc2 The Oklahoman. Sept. 5, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Approval of SQ 744 would more than change the game in Oklahoma\par \par \uc2 Game-changing state questions were put on the Nov. 2 ballot, measures that supporters touted as a way to dramatically increase spending for schools and health care.\par \par \uc2 The year was 2004. Brad Henry was ending his second year in the governor's office. This Nov. 2, as Henry nears the end of his eighth and final year in office, another game-changing state question is on the ballot. Again, education funding is front and center.\par \par \uc2 Henry opposes State Question 744, which would cripple non-education state services. Six years ago, he supported three state questions that dominated Oklahoma news during a presidential election season.\par \par \uc2 They were the controversial measures creating a state lottery, establishing the "racino" concept and significantly raising the tobacco tax. All three questions passed, two of them having been sold as a way to increase education funding without a general tax increase.\par \par \uc2 How much have these new "sin taxes" benefited the state?\par \par \uc2 A lot. An analysis by the Oklahoma Policy Institute's David Blatt lays out the results of the people's vote on the three questions.\par \par \uc2 State Question 705, which won with about 65 percent of the vote, created a state lottery that's generated nearly $1 billion in revenue in the five fiscal years for which numbers are available. Net proceeds (after lottery payouts and expenses) go to common schools, higher education and CareerTech.\par \par \uc2 Lottery sales "have remained remarkably consistent," Blatt said. Demand for lottery tickets has proved to be elastic, nearly immune from the effects of recession and competition from other gambling options.\par \par \uc2 State Question 712, which won with 59.5 percent of the vote, authorized gaming at racetracks and expanded gambling options at tribal casinos, in exchange for a portion of revenues. Between 2005 and 2010, gaming revenues have totaled $421 million, the lion's share of which came from the tribal side of the ledger.\par \par \uc2 State Question 713, the least popular of the three questions (getting 53 percent of the vote), raised the tobacco tax by a net 55 cents a pack for products sold by nontribal retailers. That increase has generated $649 million over what the state would have gotten had the old tax rate stayed in effect.\par \par \uc2 The bottom line from the people's support of these three state questions in 2004 is that just over $2 billion more has been generated for items benefiting state coffers than would have been the case had the questions failed. A lot of dough, right? Yes. But it's not as much as SQ 744 would cost all taxpayers in less than two years of perpetual funding.\par \par \uc2 This is one reason Henry's predecessor, Frank Keating, calls 744 "the most dangerous, the most audacious and the most insidious" state question imaginable.\par \par \uc2 SQ 744 would not only change the game. It would break the bank. Approving it would be a sin.\par \par \uc2 Muskogee Phoenix. Sept. 1, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Inmate education program likely to reap benefits\par \par \uc2 More than 100 inmates at Eddie Warrior Correctional Center are taking classes this semester from Connors State College.\par \par \uc2 Most of them are able to do so because of money raised by the Friends of Eddie Warrior (FEW) Foundation. The FEW Foundation is a private trust founded by former Muskogee resident Suzanne Edmondson 13 years ago. The foundation underwrites college classes for prison inmates.\par \par \uc2 This is a good -- and needed -- program.\par \par \uc2 "Studies have shown that the more education a female offender gets, the less likely she is to offend again," said Trish Baker, college coordinator for Eddie Warrior.\par \par \uc2 Connors academic adviser Colleen Noble has seen the changes in the inmates wrought by their education.\par \par \uc2 "As they start their classes, you can see their confidence level go up," she said. "At graduation, you can see the smiles, the shoulders thrown back."\par \par \uc2 We hope other prisons can find a way to duplicate the success at Eddie Warrior.\par \par \uc2 More than 25,000 are behind bars in Oklahoma -- fifth highest in the nation per capita -- and most of those are in prison for nonviolent crimes, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.\par \par \uc2 If inmates had the opportunity to go to college and take advantage of it while behind bars, we believe it would reduce our prison population. We think it would help with the recidivism problem, as a convict with a degree would be less likely to throw all that hard work away and end up behind bars again.\par \par \uc2 But employers must be willing to hire a convict. And we believe if a convict showed the initiative to make the best of a bad situation and better themselves, they deserve a shot.\par \par \uc2 The Norman Transcript. Sept. 3, 2010.\par \par \uc2 State's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population on the rise\par \par \uc2 A report from the Pew Center suggests the United States' population of undocumented immigrants has declined. Nationally, it is estimated there are about 7.8 million illegal immigrants with about 60,000 in Oklahoma in 2009.\par \par \uc2 The state's numbers are up about 5,000 over 2008 estimates and an Associated Press report suggests migration from Texas may be impacting the state's numbers.\par \par \uc2 The national dip is the first reversal in the growth in the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population in 20 years. It could be reflective of the labor market as many come here looking for work and could be an increase in deportations.\par \par \uc2 A scholar at the Brookings Institution, writing in USA Today this week, said the government deports about 350,000 annually. Since 1999, more than 2.2 million people have been sent home.\par \par \uc2 Darrell M. West, Brookings' vice president of governance, addressed seven myths of the immigration debate. On taxes, he said a large number of undocumented workers pay income, Social Security and Medicare taxes as well as sales and property taxes.\par \par \uc2 One study found they pay $162 billion in federal, state and local taxes. Another researcher estimated the average \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  paid in $1,800 more in taxes than they received in government benefits.\par \par \uc2 Mr. West also writes that polling data indicates 63 percent of Americans surveyed favor a "path to citizenship" for illegal immigrants. Conditions include a background check, a monetary fine and employment.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100907e6970028v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - A former lawyer for the Muslim parents of a girl who ran away from home after converting to Christianity says in a $10 million federal lawsuit that a blogger and a former attorney for the girl defamed him by alleging he has contacts with terrorists and criminals.\par \par \uc2 Attorney Omar Tarazi is seeking $10 million in a lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Columbus to compensate him for damage he alleges was done to his reputation.\par \par \uc2 Tarazi represented the parents of Rifqa Bary, a Christian teenager who fled to Florida, saying she feared harm from her Muslim mother and father. Bary was returned to Ohio last year and placed in foster care while a juvenile court judge tried unsuccessfully to reunite Bary and her parents.\par \par \uc2 Bary left the custody of Franklin County children services when she turned 18 last month. Police investigations in Ohio and Florida found no evidence she would be harmed.\par \par \uc2 Bary, who emigrated from Sri Lanka with her family when she was 5, was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  until last week when she gained her green card, her attorney, Kort Gatterdam, said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 In his lawsuit, Tarazi said blogger Pamela Oshry wrongly linked him to Hamas, considered a terrorist group by the U.S. government. He said she also falsely said he was appointed to represent Bary's parents by the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\par \par \uc2 CAIR is a Washington-based Islamic advocacy group. Oshry, who typically goes by the name Pamela Geller, repeatedly refers to Tarazi on her website, Atlas Shrugs, as a lawyer appointed or selected by CAIR. Her website also includes links to sites alleging CAIR is a terrorist front.\par \par \uc2 Geller also leads an organization called Stop Islamization of America that placed ads on New York City buses last spring offering information to those wishing to leave Islam. And she is organizing a protest on Sept. 11 in New York against a proposed Islamic cultural center to be built near ground zero.\par \par \uc2 Tarazi says Orlando, Fla., attorney John Stemberger, who represented Bary in Florida, defamed him by calling him unqualified and also alleging in a December TV interview that he has terrorist ties.\par \par \uc2 Stemberger on Tuesday called Tarazi's lawsuit a frivolous publicity stunt and said he would welcome the chance to document his statements about Tarazi.\par \par \uc2 The filing is "typical of the type of sensationalism and outrageous conduct" that lawyers for Bary's parents displayed in Florida and Ohio, Stemberger said.\par \par \uc2 Geller said by e-mail that she had not seen the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Tarazi said he has never worked for CAIR or been appointed by the group to represent Bary's parents, which he said he did pro bono except for some minor expenses his clients paid for.\par \par \uc2 Tarazi said his mother volunteered as a secretary with CAIR-Ohio in Columbus but left that position three years ago.\par \par \uc2 Tarazi says the comments about him have damaged his reputation permanently, in part because Internet searches of his name turn up "accusations of perjury, conflict of interest, being unqualified as an attorney."\par \par \uc2 Individuals are supporting Bary financially as she makes decisions about her future, said Gatterdam, who would not identify the people or say where Bary was or what she was doing.\par \par \uc2 "It's been a very traumatic last nine or 10 months," Gatterdam said. "Now she's sitting back and planning her future."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100907e6970022u\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15
