SHEAR \par \uc2 774 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 September 2018\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- A federal judge in Texas declined on Friday to halt an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation, handing a temporary victory to activists who are waging a legal fight against the Trump administration to save it.\par \par \uc2 The judge, Andrew S. Hanen of the Federal District Court in Houston, said the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, had been relied upon by hundreds of thousands of immigrants since it was established almost six years ago, and should not be abruptly ended.\par \par \uc2 The ruling means that young immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as small children can continue to apply for the program, which shields them from immediate deportation and provides a permit to work legally in the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a huge sigh of relief,'' said \uc2 Marielena Hincapi\u233\'00\'E9\uc2 , the executive director of the \uc2 National Immigration Law Center\uc2 . ''This is a huge loss for Trump and the Department of Justice, who clearly want to end the program.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump announced a year ago an end to the DACA program, calling it an illegal use of executive power by his predecessor, former President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 . Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the time called DACA an ''unfair system'' that had victimized millions of Americans by allowing ''illegal aliens'' to take their jobs.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Trump's effort to end the program was blocked by several other federal judges, who have temporarily required the administration to allow qualified undocumented immigrants to renew their protected status under the DACA program.\par \par \uc2 The State of Texas and eight other states filed a separate lawsuit seeking to declare the DACA program illegal and seeking an injunction to stop it, but Judge Hanen refused to do so.\par \par \uc2 The Texas judge, who in 2015 blocked a similar effort by Mr. Obama that would have added protections for the undocumented parents of citizens and other lawful residents, compared the idea of ending the DACA program to an attempt to ''unscramble'' an egg.\par \par \uc2 ''Here, the egg has been scrambled,'' Judge Hanen wrote. ''To try to put it back in the shell with only a preliminary injunction record, and perhaps at great risk to many, does not make sense nor serve the best interests of this country.''\par \par \uc2 Judge Hanen's ruling was unexpected. In his ruling in 2015 about the program for parents, he made it clear that he thought both efforts to protect undocumented immigrants were \uc2 illegal. Immigrant\uc2  rights activists were bracing for a ruling by Judge Hanen against the DACA program.\par \par \uc2 In his ruling on Friday, Judge Hanen made it clear that he thought the DACA program was likely to be declared illegal in the long run. A spokesman for the Justice Department praised the judge for that part of his ruling.\par \par \uc2 ''As the Justice Department has consistently argued, DACA is an unlawful attempt to circumvent Congress, and we are pleased the court agreed today,'' said Devin O'Malley, the spokesman.\par \par \uc2 But the judge made a distinction between the two programs. He noted that the one aimed at parents, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, had not yet been implemented when conservative attorneys general challenged its legality -- a challenge that the judge agreed with.\par \par \uc2 He also wrote that, in his view, the legal problems with both programs ''are basically identical.''\par \par \uc2 In the case of DACA, however, more than 700,000 young immigrants have come to rely on the program as a way of getting jobs and avoiding the prospect of being sent back to the country of their birth. The judge said that the potential harm to those immigrants was too great to simply end the program.\par \par \uc2 ''The reality of the situation is that it conferred lawful presence and numerous other benefits, and many DACA recipients and others nationwide have relied upon it for the last six years,'' Judge Hanen wrote.\par \par \uc2 He also added that ''DACA is a popular program and one that Congress should consider saving.'' Congressional action to come up with a permanent solution for the DACA program has stalled amid bitter recriminations between Mr. Trump and Democrats.\par \par \uc2 But the legal fight over the DACA program is not over. Judges in the other cases have ordered the Trump administration to keep the program alive while litigation proceeds, though with some limitations. The government has already appealed most of those rulings.\par \par \uc2 ''They are living in a legal limbo so far,'' Ms. Hincapi\u233\'00\'E9 said. ''At the end of the day, we need a permanent solution.''\par \par \uc2 Get politics and Washington news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the Morning Briefing newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020180901ee910003n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

PETERS; Sydney Ember contributed reporting from New York. \par \uc2 1,640 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 August 2018\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- President Trump and congressional Republicans, who are eager to find an issue that can help minimize the losses they expect in the midterm elections, are leaning hard into crime, illegal immigration and public safety to paint a bleak picture of how the country would become less safe under a Democratic-controlled Congress.\par \par \uc2 This week, they sought to put a face with that picture. The news that a missing Iowa college student, Mollie Tibbetts, had been found dead, and that a man the authorities said was an undocumented immigrant was charged with her murder, was seized upon by Republicans, who had already been sounding dire warnings about spreading violence and insecure borders.\par \par \uc2 ''A person came in from Mexico illegally and killed her,'' said Mr. Trump, speaking about Ms. Tibbetts in a video he posted to \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . ''We need the wall, we need our immigration laws changed, we need our border laws changed.''\par \par \uc2 Then, framing the matter as a choice between the two parties in the upcoming elections, he added, ''We need Republicans to do it because the Democrats aren't going to do it.''\par \par \uc2 In messages and ads directed at voters -- especially women, who are most motivated by concerns over personal safety, polling shows -- Republicans say that if the Democrats are victorious in November, violent crime and drugs will become greater scourges, the MS-13 gang will run rampant, and communities will unravel. Republicans point to the sudden popularity on the left of the ''Abolish ICE'' movement, which seeks to dismantle the \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  agency, as evidence of how Democrats would harm public safety.\par \par \uc2 Republicans say they believe they have an advantage over Democrats on the issue of immigration when it is presented as a matter of personal security. And, armed with party research that shows voters are far less likely to support candidates who have said they want to ''abolish ICE,'' Republicans have begun hitting those Democrats with ads, using their own words.\par \par \uc2 An ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC supporting House Republican candidates, features audio of Sharice Davids, a Democrat running for a Republican-held seat near Kansas City, saying she would support eliminating the agency. ''Sharice Davids: Open borders, amnesty -- a risk we can't take,'' the ad says.\par \par \uc2 ''Democrats do not want to have an election on these things,'' said Pat Caddell, a veteran pollster who has worked for Republicans and Democrats and is now helping a group led by \uc2 Stephen K. Bannon\uc2 , the former White House chief strategist, that is trying to protect the Republican House majority. ''On immigration, the Democratic Party has been pulled so far left. And that's the story of our politics this year: deserting the center.''\par \par \uc2 On the surface, these efforts represent the latest flare-up in the intractable national debate over immigration policy. But the death of Ms. Tibbetts -- police say the 20-year-old was killed by Cristhian Rivera, an immigrant farmworker, who stuffed her in the trunk of a car and then dumped her body in a field -- has exposed a deeper cultural and political divide.\par \par \uc2 The din of outrage coming from all sides -- on the left, accusations of callous exploitation and fearmongering; on the right, criticisms that political correctness is trumping public safety -- underlines the growing disparity between those who largely trust Mr. Trump's diagnoses of the country's problems and believe he and Republicans should be given more time to fix them, and those who are disgusted with his leadership and want to throw him and his party out of power.\par \par \uc2 ''She was killed by a person who is exactly what Trump has been warning about,'' \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , the former House speaker, said on Fox News, bringing to mind Mr. Trump's first speech as a presidential candidate in 2015, in which he blamed Mexico for sending criminals and rapists across the southern border. ''The left has to bear the burden of being the party that is tolerating Americans being killed by people who are here illegally,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican who has been one of the president's biggest defenders on issues of immigration, tweeted, ''Mollie would be alive if our government had taken immigration enforcement seriously years ago.''\par \par \uc2 The news of the break in the Tibbetts case on Monday was a tragic ending to her disappearance a month ago. But the timing, as far as Mr. Trump and his allies were concerned, could not have been better. Word that an immigrant had been charged in her death came the same afternoon that Mr. Trump's longtime lawyer and fixer implicated him in a scheme to pay off alleged paramours and his former campaign manager was found guilty of eight counts of financial fraud.\par \par \uc2 The stories, and the different ways they were covered, played to the themes that Mr. Trump returns to frequently: illegal immigration and the crime and economic devastation he says it wreaks; a corrupted, one-sided justice system that he says punishes him and his allies but no one else; and a political system controlled by elites in both parties who he believes never accepted his victory.\par \par \uc2 Fox News set the tone for how prominently the Tibbetts story would feature in the media universe the president and his supporters follow most closely. As other networks covered the president's growing legal exposure, \uc2 Fox\uc2  alone broke in with news of Ms. Tibbetts's death. Its coverage of her disappearance, and of the discovery of her body, has been exhaustive, with correspondents on the scene in Iowa featuring in multiple segments every hour. On Wednesday night, the host who was filling in for Laura Ingraham opened the program by boasting, ''Fox News is the only network fully covering the case.''\par \par \uc2 That most other major news outlets paid the story comparatively little attention only gave Mr. Trump more ammunition to make his case that the media cannot be trusted.\par \par \uc2 Chris Buskirk, a conservative writer and radio host, summed up the attitude of many of Mr. Trump's defenders. ''See, the mainstream media is at it again,'' he said. ''In fact, let's do our fourth hour with \uc2 Michael Avenatti\uc2 ,'' he added, joking about the frequency with which Mr. Avenatti, a frequent critic of the president, appears on cable news shows.\par \par \uc2 The authorities have said that Mr. Rivera, the man charged in Ms. Tibbetts's death, was in the United States illegally. His lawyer has disputed that claim. Most social scientists who have looked at crime among immigrants have concluded that noncitizens are less likely to engage in criminal activity. A recent study by the libertarian-leaning \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2 , for example, found that in Texas, conviction and arrest rates for undocumented immigrants were lower than those for native-born Americans.\par \par \uc2 That has not stopped Mr. Trump, his White House or its supporters from suggesting otherwise. The administration regularly sends out emails to journalists with stories of immigrant crime, including one this week about a killing in Minnesota with the subject line, ''Authorities: Immigrant in U.S. illegally killed Shakopee woman, slashed own throat.''\par \par \uc2 Violent crimes by immigrants have become staples in conservative media, and Breitbart News and Fox News often lead the way. In February, for instance, after a young child was killed in North Carolina when an impaired driver hit the ambulance that was carrying him and his mother, Fox News and other right-wing outlets seized on reports that the man was from El Salvador and was thought to be in the country illegally. Fox News was similarly abuzz earlier this month after a convicted rapist pleaded guilty to re-entering the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump himself often uses these types of violent crimes to resurface his positions on immigration. Last year, after a woman was killed in Los Angeles by a drunken driver who officials said was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , the woman's fianc\u233\'00\'E9 said that Mr. Trump had called him to offer condolences and to reiterate his promise to secure the border.\par \par \uc2 And even before he was elected, Mr. Trump dedicated some of his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to the story of Sarah Root, 21, who had been killed in Nebraska by a Honduran immigrant who was driving drunk.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the case of Kathryn Steinle, whose killing on a San Francisco pier in 2015 was taken up by conservatives as a symbol of what was wrong with the country's immigration laws. Throughout his campaign, Mr. Trump had invoked her name, using her death to justify his hard-line immigration policies. When the suspect, an undocumented Mexican immigrant, was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges late last year, Mr. Trump called the verdict ''disgraceful'' and ''a complete travesty of justice,'' promptly renewing his call to build a wall on the border with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Some members of Ms. Tibbetts's family have objected to the swift politicization of her death. ''I don't want Mollie's memory to get lost amongst politics,'' an aunt, Billie Jo Calderwood, told \uc2 CNN\uc2 . Samantha Lucas, a second cousin who told \uc2 CNN\uc2  that she did not know Ms. Tibbetts well, said she believed Ms. Tibbetts ''would not want this to be used as fuel against undocumented immigrants.''\par \par \uc2 The details that have trickled out about Ms. Tibbetts's life reveal only a glimpse of who she was: a cross-country runner who sat on the homecoming court, had an infectious smile and, recalled her brother, could be ''a little clumsy.''\par \par \uc2 The circumstances of her disappearance and death, however, are now well known.\par \par \uc2 Mollie Tibbetts's body was discovered this week in Iowa after she was reported missing last month.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Until he turned 11\u189\'00\'BD, Isamu Shibayama's childhood was idyllic.\par \par \uc2 His father was a successful textile importer and dress-shirt wholesaler in Lima, Peru. His house was staffed by servants. He was chauffeured to private school. He spent summers living on the coast with his grandparents, who owned a department store, and swimming in the Pacific.\par \par \uc2 Then, on Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.\par \par \uc2 Isamu's father was playing tennis when news of the air raid was broadcast. He was immediately summoned home. His family and their friends were frightened. But even with anti-Japanese sentiment spreading in Peru, nobody predicted what would happen next.\par \par \uc2 The Shibayama family, joining nearly 2,000 others of Japanese heritage living in Peru, were rounded up by the police, turned over to American troops and shipped to prison camps in Texas and other states. They would remain there from 1942 to 1944, sharing the fate of tens of thousands of Japanese-Americans who were also interned.\par \par \uc2 In boarding a chartered military troop ship bound for New Orleans, Isamu Shibayama embarked on what would prove to be a three-decade struggle to become an American citizen. Until then, his wife, Betty Shibayama, said last year, ''he was a man without a country.''\par \par \uc2 Even more, his forced removal from the country in which he was born set him on a lifetime quest for a formal apology and reparations from the \uc2 United States government\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shibayama did become a citizen. But when he died on July 31 in San Jose, Calif., at 88 a retired gas station owner, his ultimate mission remained unfulfilled.\par \par \uc2 Just last year, after he had given up on getting satisfaction in United States courts, he appealed to the \uc2 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights\uc2 , an agency of the Washington-based \uc2 Organization of American States\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At a hearing to determine whether Mr. Shibayama and two of his brothers had been victims of human rights violations during World War II, the commission's president, Francisco Jose Eguiguren Praeli, a former Peruvian justice minister, expressed his personal apologies. But the commission had yet to issue any formal findings when Mr. Shibayama died.\par \par \uc2 Washington's agenda in expatriating the Peruvians of Japanese descent from Latin America was twofold. One aim, the government said, was to make the nation's southern border less vulnerable to infiltration or attack; the other was to provide a pool of people of Japanese ethnicity who might be traded for American civilians stranded in Japan after the Pearl Harbor attack.\par \par \uc2 Whatever resistance the policy generated in Peru, it was tempered by the same kind of anti-Japanese prejudice that the war had stoked in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, there was a growing consensus that expelling the ethnic Japanese, particularly those who ran businesses, would reduce competition for other Peruvians struggling in a depressed economy.\par \par \uc2 Japanese began migrating to Peru in the late 19th century, mostly as contract laborers, but many moved to the cities and had become, like Mr. Shibayama's father, successful entrepreneurs.\par \par \uc2 Isamu Shibayama was born on June 6, 1930, in Lima, Peru's capital. He was the eldest of eight children of Yuzo and Tatsue (Ishibashi) Shibayama, immigrants from Fukuoka, on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. He was baptized Carlos Arturo Isamu and came to be called Art for short.\par \par \uc2 After the war broke out, his grandparents in Peru were among the first to be seized. Sent to the United States, they were put in a detention camp for enemy aliens in Seagoville, Tex., near Dallas, until they were deported to Japan in an exchange for Americans held there.\par \par \uc2 In Peru, Mr. Shibayama's father went into hiding, but he turned himself in after his wife and 11-year-old daughter were arrested.\par \par \uc2 After being shipped to New Orleans, the family was taken by train to the federal government's largest wartime internment camp, in Crystal City, Tex., southwest of San Antonio.\par \par \uc2 [Video: hidden internment part 1 Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shibayama recalled that as a schoolboy he had difficulty in classes taught in English and Japanese -- his primary language was Spanish -- but managed to finish the eighth grade. Around the camp, he delivered mail and ice and joined the baseball team.\par \par \uc2 When the war ended, in 1945, the family was warned that they would be unwelcome in Peru. But neither were they embraced in their new home. The American authorities classified them as illegal immigrants on the grounds that they had entered the country without proper authorization.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shibayama said he was confounded by the government's position. In an interview with Discover Nikkei, an advocacy group that says it supports ''Japanese migrants and their descendants,'' he asked, ''How can I be illegal when we didn't want to come here in the first place, and the government brings us, brings us here, forces us to come here, and they bring us at gunpoint?''\par \par \uc2 With the war over, his family was scheduled to be deported to Japan, by then a devastated country enduring shortages of food and other staples. The family was unwilling to go.\par \par \uc2 They were rescued by Wayne M. Collins, a lawyer with \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 , who intervened and arranged to have Mr. Shibayama's father hired by Seabrook Farms, a frozen-vegetable packing factory in New Jersey. The family was paroled and moved there, settling in the town of Seabrook.\par \par \uc2 In time the family moved to Chicago. In 1952, though still classified as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Mr. Shibayama was drafted into the Army and deployed to Germany. He was honorably discharged two years later.\par \par \uc2 After returning to Chicago, he took the advice of solicitous immigration officials and traveled to Canada so that he could re-enter the United States from there. Once he did, he was told that he could qualify for permanent residency but would have to live in the United States for about five years before he was eligible for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 In the interim, he took a mechanics course, was hired by a car dealer and married Betty Morita, a Japanese-American who had lived on a farm in Oregon before she, too, was sent to an internment camp.\par \par \uc2 She survives him, along with their children, Bekki and Brian; his brothers, Ken, Tac and George; and his sister, Rose Nishimura. His death was confirmed by his daughter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shibayama received permanent resident status in 1956 and was finally granted citizenship in 1970, the same year he moved to California.\par \par \uc2 After the Office of Redress Administration was established as part of the Justice Department in 1988 to indemnify Japanese-Americans who had been interned, Mr. Shibayama applied for reparations. His request was denied; only Japanese-Americans who had been citizens or permanent residents during the war were eligible, and he, of course, had been neither.\par \par \uc2 Years later, a coalition of Japanese Latin Americans called the Campaign for Justice sued for reparations and won its case. In 1999, the federal government expressed regret and awarded each of them $5,000 (compared with the $20,000 in tax-free restitution being paid to Americans of Japanese descent).\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shibayama, however, declined the payment and sued on his own. When he lost in federal court, he and two of his brothers, Ken and Tac, filed their petition before the \uc2 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights\uc2  in 2002. That body can issue findings, mediate and refer cases to the \uc2 Inter-American Court of Human Rights\uc2 , which is also overseen by the \uc2 Organization of American States\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Sixteen years later, Art Shibayama's brothers are still awaiting a decision.\par \par \uc2 Isamu Shibayama, known as Art, in Seabrook, N.J., in 1952 after being drafted into the Army.; Mr. Shibayama testifying before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 2017. At his death the panel was still considering his appeal for official redress for his wartime internment. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020180819ee8j0007w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In 2006, an East Harlem high school's upset victory in a New York City-wide robot-building contest proved to be bittersweet for Amadou Ly, a member of the winning team.\par \par \uc2 Not only was Mr. Ly prevented from boarding a plane to Atlanta for the national finals with the rest of his team, because he lacked government identification; he was also facing deportation as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ly (pronounced Lee) had immigrated from Senegal, West Africa, with his mother in 2001. A year later, after his visitor's visa had expired, she abandoned him.\par \par \uc2 In 2004, when a car he was riding in got into an accident, the police reported him to the immigration authorities. But that encounter, after a series of frustrating court appearances, ultimately delivered him, to his good fortune, to Amy Meselson, a Legal Aid Society lawyer in New York.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Meselson had dedicated her career to defending hundreds of vulnerable immigrants from deportation and helping them navigate the gaps between the child welfare and national security bureaucracies. She recruited volunteers from corporate law firms to represent foster children in immigration cases, and she successfully lobbied for a special juvenile section in immigration court.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ly had been pinning his hopes on the Dream Act, the legislation that would have granted a path to citizenship to undocumented immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children through no fault of their own.\par \par \uc2 When that legislation stalled in Congress, though, Ms. Meselson suggested that Mr. Ly's impressive performance on the East Harlem Tutorial Program team at Central Park East High School might elicit public support for his case.\par \par \uc2 ''I was very scared at that time,'' he recalled, ''but I knew I could trust her.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Meselson helped bring Mr. Ly's plight to public attention, namely providing information for a front-page profile in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . The article produced an outpouring of legal, public and political support.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials were persuaded to drop the deportation proceedings and grant Mr. Ly a foreign student visa. He graduated from Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, became a citizen, embarked on an acting career and moved to Hollywood.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Meselson, who had struggled with depression since she was a teenager, committed suicide on July 22 at her home in Manhattan, her mother, Sarah Meselson, said. She was 46.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ly, now 30, said in a recorded tribute that he sent to Ms. Meselson's family: ''I was able to stay in this country, I was able to live my dream and grow up and feed my family and help out others because she helped me and she did it with open arms. She was my hero.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Meselson worked in the immigration law unit of the \uc2 Legal Aid Society\uc2  in New York from 2002 until 2016, focusing on unaccompanied migrant children. She had recently become the managing attorney of the Immigrant Justice Corps, a volunteer program to provide free counsel.\par \par \uc2 Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, who was instrumental in founding the Immigrant Justice Corps, described Ms. Meselson in an email as ''a life saver and life giver.''\par \par \uc2 ''What Amy did was to give hope to immigrants and their families, to make it possible for dreams for a better life to be realized, for despair to be transformed into hope,'' Judge Katzmann said.\par \par \uc2 Amy Valor Meselson was born on Dec. 4, 1971, in Boston to Matthew Meselson, a molecular biology professor at Harvard, and Sarah Page Meselson, who researched human rights conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean for the political asylum division of the United States immigration service.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Meselson earned a bachelor's degree from \uc2 Brown University\uc2  and a master's from Harvard, both in philosophy. (Her senior thesis at Brown was about free will and determinism.) She earned her law degree at Yale.\par \par \uc2 In addition to her mother, she is survived by her father; her sister, Zoe Forbes; her stepmother, Jeanne Guillemin Meselson; her stepfather, Arthur Podaras; her stepsisters, Paola and Isabel Emerson; and her stepbrothers, Rob and John Guillemin and William Emerson IV.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Meselson earned her middle name by surviving a life-threatening respiratory disease. Besides dealing with depression, she had recently been given a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder and extreme anxiety -- all aggravated when she traveled to Greece two years ago to volunteer at a camp for Syrian refugees, Sarah Meselson said at a memorial service.\par \par \uc2 At the service, she said she wanted to recount her daughter's maladies for two reasons.\par \par \uc2 ''One,'' she said, ''is to emphasize what everyone already knows -- that it is not always possible to comprehend the level of suffering that others may be experiencing, especially when they appear to be successful and to excel to the extent that Amy did.\par \par \uc2 ''The other,'' she added, ''is to applaud my daughter for all that she accomplished despite her mental illness.''\par \par \uc2 Amy Meselson committed suicide at her home in Manhattan. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020180808ee880004y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MATAMOROS, Mexico -- Shortly before dawn one Sunday last August, a driver in an S.U.V. picked up Christopher Cruz at a stash house in this border city near the Gulf of Mexico. The 22-year-old from El Salvador was glad to leave the one-story building, where smugglers kept bundles of cocaine and marijuana alongside their human cargo, but he was anxious about what lay ahead.\par \par \uc2 The driver deposited Mr. Cruz at an illegal crossing point on the edge of the Rio Grande. A smuggler took a smartphone photograph to confirm his identity and sent it using WhatsApp to a driver waiting to pick him up on the other side of the frontier when -- if -- he made it across.\par \par \uc2 The nearly 2,000-mile trip had already cost Mr. Cruz's family more than $6,000 and brought him within sight of Brownsville, Tex. The remaining 500 miles to Houston -- terrain prowled by the United States Border Patrol as well as the state and local police -- would set them back another $6,500.\par \par \uc2 It was an almost inconceivable amount of money for someone who earned just a few dollars a day picking coffee beans back home. But he wasn't weighing the benefits of a higher-paying job. He was fleeing violence and what he said was near-certain death at the hands of local gangs.\par \par \uc2 ''There's no other option,'' Mr. Cruz said. ''The first thought I had was, 'I just need to get out of here at whatever cost.'''\par \par \uc2 The stretch of southwest border where he intended to cross has become the epicenter of the raging battle over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. One clear consequence of the tightening American border and the growing perils getting there is that more and more desperate families are turning to increasingly sophisticated smuggling operations to get relatives into the United States.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz's story provides an unusually detailed anatomy of the price of the journey. The money paid for a network of drivers who concealed him in tractor-trailers and minibuses, a series of houses where he hid out, handlers tied to criminal organizations who arranged his passage, and bribes for Mexican police officers to look the other way as he passed.\par \par \uc2 Even with his family's payment, he slept amid filth and vermin. He watched guides abandon some migrants who could not keep up, and guards prod others to become drug mules. Sometimes the smugglers identified him by a numeric code, other times by an assumed name. But as often as not, they simply called him ''the package,'' to be moved for profit like an illicit good.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Cruz, it was worth it. ''They can build as many walls as they want,'' he said, referring to American officials. ''They can send as many soldiers to the border as they want, but a people's need and desire for a better life is stronger.''\par \par \uc2 President Trump and his supporters have called for greater vigilance along the border to keep out people like Mr. Cruz, a low-skilled worker who followed in the path of other family members who also arrived illegally, and who hopes those left behind will join him.\par \par \uc2 Pledging to halt illegal immigration, Mr. Trump has pushed for a 1,000-mile wall, ordered National Guard units to the border and encouraged workplace roundups of undocumented immigrants, which had largely been curtailed during the Obama years.\par \par \uc2 The number of illegal crossings has dropped significantly in the last decade, but responding to a surge in recent months of Central Americans arriving at the southern border or sneaking across it, the administration has embraced even tougher measures: ''zero tolerance'' for those arriving illegally, by requiring criminal prosecutions; family separation, a policy from which Mr. Trump was forced to retreat after images of children wailing for their parents provoked a public outcry; and eliminating domestic violence and gang violence as grounds for granting asylum to migrants who arrived at legal crossing points.\par \par \uc2 ''The zero-tolerance policy and the publicity surrounding the child separations will further strengthen the smuggling networks and reinforce the patterns we have observed, as the risks, costs and fees are significantly growing,'' said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University and an expert on organized crime. ''This will certainly increase the demand for smugglers and will further strengthen the connection between human smugglers and other criminal actors, such as drug cartels and corrupt local law enforcement.''\par \par \uc2 The homeland security secretary, \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2 , told lawmakers in May that migrants paid $500 million a year to groups fueling violence and instability in the region. A decade ago, Mexicans and Central Americans paid between $1,000 and $3,000 for clandestine passage into the United States. Now they hand over up to $9,200 for the same journey, the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  reported last year. Those figures have continued to rise, according to interviews at migrant shelters in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 To trace Mr. Cruz's journey from El Salvador, The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  relied on extensive interviews with him and his family, and reviewed contemporaneous photographs, text messages, receipts and GPS positions.\par \par \uc2 His uncle in the United States checked in constantly by Facebook Messenger during his weeks on the road. He asked for proof-of-life selfies and confirmed his locations along the route using the Find My iPhone app before wiring money for each leg of the journey.\par \par \uc2 The Times also interviewed dozens of experts, academics, and current and former law enforcement officials about the underground economy of human smuggling. Reporters reviewed more than 200 recent criminal complaints in smuggling cases along the southwest border, including those brought against drivers, stash-house operators, foot guides and migrants.\par \par \uc2 That day at the Rio Grande last summer, a guide prepared to lead Mr. Cruz and some two dozen other migrants to the far side of the river while three lookouts perched in trees, scanning the horizon for any hint of the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 When he arrived at the crossing, Mr. Cruz found that the river wasn't wide, at most a few hundred feet, but the water was murky and full of debris. The smugglers had gathered the migrants at the water's edge, with giant inflated inner tubes for those who couldn't swim. They said the makeshift rafts were slower than swimming, so Mr. Cruz pulled off his skinny-leg khakis and T-shirt and paddled to the other side in his boxer shorts.\par \par \uc2 After climbing up the bank, his first tenuous toehold in the United States, he crouched, wet and shivering, in the brush and got dressed. Mr. Cruz's face had lost much of its roundness as he had shed 30 pounds over a month of hard travel. A life of skateboarding, tinkering with computers and eating his grandmother's cooking had not prepared him for the demands of the road.\par \par \uc2 The smugglers almost hadn't let him cross, because they worried that his coughing fits from a respiratory infection might give the group away. But he had made it. The foot guide passed along the all-clear signal from the sentries in the trees, and the small crowd of migrants began to sprint toward the 18-foot steel security fence blocking their passage into the United States. That area of the border, which Mr. Trump wants to fortify with a new wall, was already among the stretches best defended by the Americans.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz had climbed halfway up the fence when he heard a helicopter overhead and saw patrol cars converging. Agents grabbed those already over the fence and began to arrest them.\par \par \uc2 ''When I saw that, I slid down and I ran back,'' Mr. Cruz recalled. He dived again into the Rio Grande, his only hope to escape back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Under Fear of Death\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz grew up in San Miguel, the fourth-largest city in El Salvador. Gang violence is virtually endemic in the country, and Mr. Cruz dropped out of high school when the infamous MS-13 became too dangerous there. His family relocated to Berl\u237\'00\'EDn, about an hour's drive away, which had less of a gang problem than the big cities.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz's mother lived in the United States, but he was much closer to her brother there, an uncle he considered a father figure and called ''Papi.'' Mr. Cruz lived with his grandmother and younger sister. He also had a 2-year-old son to provide for, though he and the boy's mother had broken up.\par \par \uc2 During coffee-picking season he rose at 4 in the morning, walked an hour to the farm where he worked, then plucked ripe red coffee cherries until dark. He usually earned $15 to $20 a week. Outside harvest season, Mr. Cruz painted murals and cleaned streets for the local government. He briefly worked as a bartender at a restaurant an hour's bus ride away.\par \par \uc2 The police had all but declared open season on gang-age men, Mr. Cruz said, and he and his friends were harassed and beaten by the security forces. Meanwhile, gang members regularly threatened him and shook him down for money because they realized he received support from his uncle in the United States.\par \par \uc2 One night, Mr. Cruz and his friends were walking home when they noticed a blue Honda creeping behind them. When the young men started to run, the car accelerated, then followed Mr. Cruz as the group split up.\par \par \uc2 ''I got to my house and it was locked,'' he recalled. He considered climbing over the front gate but worried the men who were following him might kill his grandmother and sister too. Over his shoulder he saw the gang members draw guns as he fled across a soccer field before taking refuge in a nearby health clinic.\par \par \uc2 After that night, he resolved to leave. ''That is the reality of El Salvador,'' he said. ''You are scared of both, the gangs and the police.'' He did not consider trying to enter United States legally to seek asylum; even under the more lenient asylum policies a year ago only a fraction of gang-violence victims won that status.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz had never gone farther than neighboring Honduras. But in some Central American cities, smuggling services to the United States are openly promoted on the streets, with hawkers luring customers the way agents at tourist destinations advertise sailing or snorkeling excursions. They take potential customers to a back room of a nearby store, where salesmen pitch them on a smuggling route. Some would-be migrants give up homes, cars, livestock and even farmland tilled by their families for generations and take on debt to pay the fees.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz's uncle, who now has legal status in the United States after arriving illegally years ago, spoke to a woman in his local Salvadoran community. She told him of smugglers who brought her three children over for a flat $20,000 fee after gang members back home killed her husband. The uncle used WhatsApp to contact a woman in Mexico representing the smuggling network, who became the point of contact throughout Mr. Cruz's journey.\par \par \uc2 ''Would it be possible to pick up my nephew as close as possible to the edge of San Salvador?'' the uncle asked her in one message. ''The boy is 22 years old but acts more like 12.'' The uncle spoke on the condition of anonymity because he, like other relatives of unauthorized immigrants, feared he could be prosecuted for trafficking a family member.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz worried about the trip. His best friend had made the same journey the year before only to be kidnapped near the American border and held for two months. His family paid $20,000 to free him, and he ended up back in El Salvador. And a female friend of Mr. Cruz had been raped by smugglers on the American side of the border, caught by the authorities and then deported.\par \par \uc2 His uncle assured him over Facebook Messenger that everything would be fine.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz's aunt and uncle earned enough to advance him the money for the journey, but Mr. Cruz would have to pay them back. They wired $800 to El Salvador the day he set out on the initial leg of the trip. ''Any opportunity you have to connect, send me a message with your location,'' the uncle wrote.\par \par \uc2 ''Activate Find My iPhone so you can find out my location from the iCloud,'' Mr. Cruz answered. ''That way you'll know the route I'm taking.'' Mr. Cruz set off for the United States with a backpack carrying three changes of clothes, deodorant, cookies and a charger for the iPhone 5 that would be his connection and lifeline.\par \par \uc2 'You Already Know How Much This Is'\par \par \uc2 His trip began with an idling pickup truck outside a mall in Soyapango, on the edge of San Salvador. The smuggler who would accompany him through El Salvador and Guatemala sat behind the wheel.\par \par \uc2 In the beginning, it was almost like being a tourist. Mr. Cruz crossed into Guatemala legally at La Hachadura, close to El Salvador's Pacific coast, with his national identity card. He even received a printed receipt.\par \par \uc2 The driver left the pickup truck behind in El Salvador and chaperoned him by bus to the capital, Guatemala City. The two of them transferred buses and traveled a few hours further to Huehuetenango, in the western highlands, which serves as a jumping-off point for the Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 They spent a night in a cheap hotel and traveled the next day to La Mesilla along the Mexican frontier. Vendors under colorful umbrellas sold drinks and snacks at the crossing. A blue sign wished travelers a ''feliz viaje,'' or nice trip, above the gate separating the two countries.\par \par \uc2 To skirt the border police outpost, the smuggler directed Mr. Cruz to a nearby industrial area where he walked alone up a gravel path and into Mexico. For the first time, he became an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz boarded a minibus, filled with local passengers, to begin his trip through the southern state of Chiapas. As instructed by the driver, at toll plazas he hunched down between the seats and covered himself with the passengers' backpacks, suitcases and packages. The driver whistled when it was safe to come out.\par \par \uc2 He was vulnerable to criminals who might try to kidnap him, police officers seeking bribes and the more robust immigration enforcement that has taken root in recent years in southern Mexico. Under pressure from Washington, the Mexican government has cracked down on migrants passing through its territory. Because of the greater vigilance along the smuggling routes, between 80 and 95 percent of migrants bound for the United States used so-called coyotes in recent years, compared with fewer than half in the early 1970s, Border Patrol surveys of captured migrants found.\par \par \uc2 Just two days into Mr. Cruz's journey, his family had to wire the smuggling network $1,900 to get him through southern Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz spent several days in a small house near Tuxtla Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez, the capital of Chiapas, sleeping on a sofa. It was comfortable enough, but he wondered what the holdup was. ''They want to move you even more than you do,'' his uncle assured him, ''because they have to pay for every day that you're there but I don't pay extra.''\par \par \uc2 When the smugglers finally continued the trip, Mr. Cruz spent a night on a hammock at an isolated spot near the Malpaso Dam, surrounded by trees. ''I was headed for Puebla yesterday, but immigration stopped two people who had gone ahead,'' he texted his uncle. ''So they moved me here instead.''\par \par \uc2 The next morning, Mr. Cruz climbed into the cab of a tractor-trailer and rode alongside the driver. At a toll area, he had his first run-in with the police. Officers stopped the truck for a routine check, and after seeing Mr. Cruz's Salvadoran ID, realized that he was in Mexico illegally. They demanded money or else they would deport him, Mr. Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 He fished out $170 he had hidden in his shoes. Mr. Cruz remembered one of the police officers telling him it was his lucky day. ''I was getting out of trouble. I was able to get away because I had this money on me,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The officers stole the truck driver's cash as well. Once they left, the driver threatened to hand the migrant over to violent drug traffickers unless Mr. Cruz got him $600. Panicked, Mr. Cruz called his aunt and uncle in the United States for help, but they didn't answer.\par \par \uc2 Thousands of miles away, the couple emerged from a water park -- a rare day off with their young daughter -- to find the missed calls. They had been observing Mr. Cruz's progress on their smartphones and computers, watching him move northward through small towns, streets full of pastel houses and parking lots for Walmarts and \uc2 Pemex\uc2  gas stations.\par \par \uc2 On the phone with his relatives, he described the police theft and the driver's threat. His uncle quickly turned to the Mexican woman at the smuggling network, who found another driver to carry Mr. Cruz to Puebla. The uncle asked Mr. Cruz to remain calm.\par \par \uc2 ''Stay calm, stay calm, everyone keeps saying that,'' Mr. Cruz responded in a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  message. ''Knowing I've never been away from home. That I'm easily frightened in a situation like this. And you want me to keep calm and keep calm. I can't.''\par \par \uc2 On subsequent traffic stops, the bribe for the police was always the same: 1,500 Mexican pesos, or about $84. At first Mr. Cruz tried to lie, saying he wasn't a migrant but was on his way to Monterrey to make a delivery. Eventually he dropped any pretense. The fourth time he was stopped for a payoff, the cop simply said, ''You already know how much this is.''\par \par \uc2 Doors Locked, Windows Barred\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz made it as far as Puebla, southeast of Mexico City and a pivot point on the journey. His family wired $450 to the smugglers, including pocket money for Mr. Cruz for food and bribes.\par \par \uc2 The woman he stayed with in Puebla treated him well, feeding him the local delicacy ''chiles en nogada,'' chiles in cream sauce with pomegranate seeds: green, white and red like the Mexican flag. She took him to buy soap, shampoo and toothpaste, but also got rid of his shoes -- Bracos, a brand that the Mexican authorities would recognize as Salvadoran -- and gave him another pair.\par \par \uc2 After four days there the smugglers tried to move him north, but word came that some migrants had been killed near Monterrey, his next stop, so they brought him back to Puebla. After waiting three more days, Mr. Cruz hid with a young woman and her infant son in the sleeping compartment of a tractor-trailer for the overnight drive to Monterrey.\par \par \uc2 The driver insisted they each take a pill, saying it was to keep them alert in case they were stopped. He then ground another pill into powder and mixed part of it in the baby's bottle before snorting the rest himself. Mr. Cruz said that he did not know what was in the pill but that after taking it he couldn't have slept even if he had tried.\par \par \uc2 He arrived in Monterrey, the third-largest metropolitan area in Mexico and an industrial and commercial hub. Far from the booming downtown, behind a metal front gate, the windows and doors were shut and barred on the cinder-block house where Mr. Cruz was kept. Trash was everywhere. The small courtyard was filled with mud and debris. Ants and cockroaches crawled indoors. The only water ran brown and unfiltered from the faucet. A terrible smell wafted from the bathroom.\par \par \uc2 ''It was like a prison,'' Mr. Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 Migrants like Mr. Cruz had to pay their captors to bring them bottled water or snacks, if they even had the cash to pay prices that were triple those at the local convenience store. Otherwise food arrived only every other day, in the form of a carton of 30 eggs to feed the dozen or so people typically there. At night, Mr. Cruz said, he lay on a thin mat on the floor but couldn't sleep with mice and insects running over him.\par \par \uc2 Every day smugglers dropped off and picked up migrants, who were kept locked inside. A Guatemalan man everyone called ''el due\u241\'00\'F1o,'' ''the owner,'' was in charge because he had been there the longest. He had run out of money to continue his journey a month and a half earlier.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz was stuck there for four days. His uncle sent $2,800, and they carried him onward to the eastern Mexican border state of Tamaulipas, just below southern Texas. His journey took him first to Ciudad Miguel Alem\u225\'00\'E1n, across from Roma, Tex., before he boarded a bus for Matamoros, two and a half hours away, with the assumed name Carlos Hernandez on his ticket.\par \par \uc2 Tamaulipas has become known for violent confrontations between organized crime groups, and migrants caught in the middle have been massacred. In the summer of 2010, the corpses of 72 migrants killed by cartel members were discovered there in San Fernando. The message was clear: Crossing into the United States without permission from the drug traffickers, or narcos, who controlled the border territory could be lethal.\par \par \uc2 Rodolfo Casillas, an expert on illegal migration at the Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales in Mexico, estimated that up to $1,000 of the total smuggling price went to pay off the narcos for the ''derecho de paso,'' or right to pass. One migrant testifying in a human-smuggling case in Texas last year told the authorities that he had paid 11,000 pesos, or about $630, for protection from the Zetas criminal organization, and just 1,500 pesos for assistance with the river crossing.\par \par \uc2 The house where Mr. Cruz was kept in Matamoros was better maintained than the hovel in Monterrey. He and the 30 other migrants could bathe with buckets of water from a pair of concrete basins with spigots outside. The men watching the house, tied to the narcos, brought them beers and even offered them drugs from bundles of cocaine and marijuana.\par \par \uc2 ''If you ran out of money, that's when they would offer to cross you as a mule,'' Mr. Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 Some migrants at the house agreed to ferry drugs.\par \par \uc2 After sending off the migrants with drugs one day, the traffickers returned to the stash house seething. ''They were extremely angry,'' Mr. Cruz recalled, not because the migrants had been arrested but because they had lost their shipment of drugs.\par \par \uc2 Back and Forth Across the Rio Grande\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz was sick. The temperature along his journey had yo-yoed 40 degrees as the altitude climbed to 7,000 feet in Puebla before dropping to sea level in Matamoros. The unsanitary conditions in Monterrey probably hadn't helped.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz was eager to leave the house in Matamoros, but his coughing spasms gave the smugglers pause. They didn't want him giving their position away as a group tried to slip past Border Patrol agents.\par \par \uc2 His uncle asked Mr. Cruz if the Mexican woman from the smuggling network could insist that they move him anyway. But Mr. Cruz realized she had little sway at the border. ''Someone else decides who leaves,'' he told his uncle, ''and she pays them.''\par \par \uc2 His family sent $180 to the smugglers, who said half would go toward medicine and half for a backup phone. Doses of cough syrup, along with several days of rest, seemed to help. That Saturday night Mr. Cruz wrote to his uncle, ''They're going to say if I leave in the morning.'' Shortly after midnight he wrote again, saying, ''At 4 o'clock in the morning I go.''\par \par \uc2 The region, where the Rio Grande coils and bends in switchbacks, has become the central battleground of the southwest frontier for illegal entries. Some 138,000 people were caught trying to cross here in 2017, close to half of all those apprehended from the California coast all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Illegal crossings fell significantly in the initial months of the Trump administration but shot up this year: From March to May, the number of migrants apprehended along the southwest border was triple the total for the same period in 2017, though far below the levels of a decade or two ago. Last year Customs and Border Protection intercepted 303,916 people there -- compared with more than 1.6 million in 2000.\par \par \uc2 As part of the $1.3 trillion spending bill that Congress passed in March, $1.375 billion in funding went for more than 90 miles of physical barriers along the border with Mexico. Of that, 33 miles will be built in the Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas, where Mr. Cruz was trying to cross.\par \par \uc2 For all the debate about Mr. Trump's proposed wall, a virtual barrier was steadily strengthened under previous administrations. Doughy blimps equipped with cameras provide video surveillance, with thermal imaging for nighttime. Migrants unknowingly trip advanced seismic sensors with their first steps on American soil. The number of Border Patrol agents has grown to about 20,000 from roughly 9,000 in 2001, while budgets have quadrupled, spent on everything from all-terrain vehicles and horse patrols to helicopters and advanced reconnaissance drones.\par \par \uc2 That gives the Border Patrol a much better chance of combating criminal smuggling networks, which use \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Craigslist\uc2  to recruit drivers, satellite phones and encrypted communication applications to direct them, night-vision technology to scan for patrols, and off-the shelf tracking devices to monitor moving vehicles.\par \par \uc2 ''They have evolved as the technology has evolved, and we have as well,'' said Benjamine Huffman, chief of strategic planning and analysis for the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 Early that morning, the smugglers gathered Mr. Cruz, one of two dozen migrants from two stash houses in town, and crammed them into the back of an S.U.V., stacking them like cordwood. Wedged into a corner of the trunk with the weight of his fellow migrants crushing down on him, Mr. Cruz struggled to catch his breath.\par \par \uc2 Once at the Rio Grande, he swam to the other side, while those who couldn't swim were pulled on the inner tubes. The migrants in his group began to mount the border fence. But the Border Patrol descended, grabbing some of the first arrivals. He realized he had to turn back.\par \par \uc2 ''There was no other alternative but to cross the river,'' Mr. Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 As was customary, the smugglers would give him three tries to make it across safely. One chance was gone. Mr. Cruz steeled himself to try again at a different bend along the river.\par \par \uc2 The temperature had climbed to 93 degrees by midday Sunday when Mr. Cruz made his second illegal visit to the United States, at another crossing nearby. It was even shorter than his first.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol agents swarmed the group as they made landfall on the north bank again. One agent got a hand on Mr. Cruz's back but, instead of arresting him, sent him sprawling into the river. Swallowing water and struggling to stay afloat, Mr. Cruz said, he barely managed to swim back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The sun was low and dusk approaching by the time the coyotes brought the migrants to their third crossing point. The smugglers said the spot, more isolated, was usually reserved for moving drug shipments, more valuable than migrants. Mr. Cruz would have to swim across the Rio Grande for the fifth time that day.\par \par \uc2 Of the 17 people left from the two dozen in the morning, Mr. Cruz recalled, five were women, including one who appeared about eight months pregnant and another in her 50s, he guessed. He wondered how they would make it, but his family had warned him: Worry about yourself. Do not stop for anyone.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz could hardly believe the determination of the pregnant woman as they emerged from the river again and started to run. But the older woman slipped behind and fell to the ground. The guide did nothing. ''He just left her there,'' Mr. Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 Checkpoints and Hidden Compartments\par \par \uc2 The driver of the waiting S.U.V. honked his horn to get their attention. He was angry, expecting just a few migrants to crawl out of the South Texas field and instead finding 16 people. In a region full of Border Patrol agents, it was a risky load to carry.\par \par \uc2 The driver told Mr. Cruz to ride shotgun, and he saw bundles of cocaine on the passenger seat. But it was only a short drive to a parking lot where the smugglers separated the group into different cars, depending on their destinations. Mr. Cruz and five others got into a Cadillac headed an hour northwest to a stash house in McAllen, Tex.\par \par \uc2 Drop-offs and pickups are often meticulously planned so that migrants are ready to jump in as soon as the car pulls up. Smugglers sometimes mark migrants with colored tape to quickly sort who is going where. Smugglers often drive two cars, using one to draw the attention of law enforcement and another to carry the migrants.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol officers have grown more aggressive in their search for unauthorized immigrants throughout the 100-mile band of territory inside the United States border, where they have authority to establish checkpoints and perform searches.\par \par \uc2 At the stash house in McAllen, the caretakers took away phones and even migrants' shoes so they wouldn't run away. ''One particular person, they beat him up and kicked him because he wasn't paying attention,'' Mr. Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 He estimated there were 70 people inside. They were given no food and were not allowed to speak to one another or even move without permission. Neighbors in border regions can be quick to report suspected stash houses. More than a third of all those busted by Customs and Border Protection last year -- 140 out of 407 in the Southwest -- were in the Rio Grande Valley, where Mr. Cruz was.\par \par \uc2 After just a day and a half in McAllen, Mr. Cruz huddled with four other migrants in the sleeping compartment of a tractor-trailer headed to San Antonio. They were nearly discovered by agents during a routine search at a highway checkpoint, cowering under blankets as they felt someone check the bedding they were hiding under. Mr. Cruz was transferred to a minivan with a concealed compartment built under the back seat, where he hid for part of the ride.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz was brought to one last stash house, stripped to just his boxer shorts in a room ''with no electricity, no light coming through, no windows and one big bed with four men,'' as he described it, essentially a hostage until the final payments were made. Two days passed.\par \par \uc2 His family had to transfer the remaining $6,500 to the smuggling network. Although a record $28.8 billion in remittances was sent to Mexico last year, the authorities regularly flag suspicious transactions. Mr. Cruz's uncle had to break up the sum into smaller, less conspicuous transfers.\par \par \uc2 Even with the precautions, one of the payments was flagged, canceled and had to be re-sent to a different recipient. Only when the final installment arrived in Mexico could Mr. Cruz go. ''They gave me my clothes to put back on, and they blindfolded me again,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The smugglers drove him to a gas station. There he saw the familiar face of his uncle. Mr. Cruz began to cry.\par \par \uc2 Relief at finishing his journey did not last long. Mr. Cruz was now in an unfamiliar country, where he did not speak the language and could not legally hold a job. He would have to hide in plain sight. He was $12,630 in debt. But, he said, at least he didn't fear for his life. ''Here I know I'm safe,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 His uncle found him tougher and more mature after the journey's hardships. Mr. Cruz looked ahead to earning enough money to begin the cycle again, paying for his son, his sister and his grandmother to join him in the United States. ''I dream of bringing them over here,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Last year, a young man left El Salvador and crossed into Guatemala to begin a 2,000- mile, nearly $13,000 run for the U.S. Above, a bus ticket.

Arriving in the United States as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Europe by way of Cuba with his parents in 1926, he rose to become President and Chief Executive Officer of Presto Lock Co., Inc., and Executive Vice President of Kidde Corp. An engineer and inventor, he held more than thirty patents, including those for the pocket lighter gas release valve, and the well-known settable three-wheel combination lock for luggage of all kinds. A problem solver and mechanical designer par excellence, he loved the challenges of innovation. He served in the Army Air Corps Combat Cargo Command as a flight engineer under General Chenault from 1943-45, flying men and materials "over the hump" between China and Burma in C-47s.\par \par \uc2  He was married to his late wife Jeanette (2014) for 71 years, and leaves three children: Mark, Lisa, and Holly; six grandsons: Adam, Eric, Ian, David, Sanders, and Abram; five great grandchildren, and a lifetime of friends. 1/3\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020180701ee7100008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Scared: Americans Are Divided on Justice Kennedy's Retirement\b0\par\par\uc2 By RICHARD FAUSSET, FARAH STOCKMAN and JOSE A. DEL REAL; Monica Davey, Elizabeth Dias, John Eligon, Simon Romero and Julie Turkewitz contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,673 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2018\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 D.A. King, the head of an Atlanta-area group that opposes illegal immigration, heard word of Justice \uc2 Anthony M. Kennedy\uc2 's retirement while vacationing on St. Simons Island, off the Georgia coast. He was elated thinking of the conservative who might replace him.\par \par \uc2 Kristen Clarke\uc2 , a civil rights lawyer, heard the news on the radio not far from the Supreme Court itself, as she was driving to a Capitol Hill hearing about the Voting Rights Act. She figured her job defending voting rights was about to become much more of a challenge.\par \par \uc2 In West Hollywood, Curtis Collins was working out at Barry's Bootcamp, and he said the Supreme Court justice's announcement dominated the Wednesday afternoon conversation among the predominantly gay group of men exercising there. ''Everybody was talking about it, how appalling it was,'' he said. ''Everyone was saying they were scared. We don't normally talk about politics in there.''\par \par \uc2 And in North Carolina, as the news of the impending retirement flashed on Amy Mahle's phone, she wondered whether God might soon answer her prayers -- and let her finally see the high court overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case establishing a constitutional right to abortion. ''I think it's possible,'' she said. ''I would love that.''\par \par \uc2 It is not exactly shocking when an 81-year-old man decides to retire after 30 years on the job. And yet, Justice Kennedy's announcement this week still managed to deliver a powerful jolt to the nation. His departure comes at a fragile time for the country, as a first-term president has vigorously assumed the role of disrupter-in-chief. President Trump said he wanted to pick a jurist who could serve at least 40 years on the court, potentially cementing the president's impact on the country for generations.\par \par \uc2 Justice Kennedy, a centrist swing vote, is likely to be replaced by a reliable conservative, tipping the institution decidedly rightward. For many conservatives, this amounts to a kind of judicial grand prize, one that outweighs any concerns about Mr. Trump's departures from conservative orthodoxy.\par \par \uc2 For many liberals, the departure was almost too much to bear, particularly after a month in which they were disappointed by Supreme Court rulings that, among other things, narrowly upheld Mr. Trump's travel ban, curtailed union power, and let stand a plan to purge state voter rolls in Ohio.\par \par \uc2 ''We are so much more screwed today than we were yesterday, and we were pretty screwed yesterday,'' said Monica Russo, a 41-year-old stay at home mother on Long Island, who had just put her daughter down for a nap when she saw the news on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Coming on the heels of Tuesday's decision upholding the travel ban, Ms. Russo felt overwhelmed.\par \par \uc2 ''My stomach dropped,'' she said. ''I know that Trump is hellbent on replacing any justice with somebody who would be a threat to reproductive rights. It makes me want to do anything that I can to make sure that everybody knows the importance of voting in November.''\par \par \uc2 Americans of all political persuasions are now bracing for what is likely to be an incendiary confirmation battle, and pondering what effect a newly constituted court will have on longstanding issues, like abortion, and more recent controversies, like immigration, that Mr. Trump has stoked.\par \par \uc2 Mr. King, eagerly awaiting who will move into Mr. Kennedy's office, is a well-known and influential activist in Georgia whose flavor of anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  activism prefigured that of Mr. Trump: He is president of a group called The Dustin Inman Society, named for a teenage boy killed in 2000 in a wreck with an undocumented immigrant driver.\par \par \uc2 ''I trust that the president is going to nominate a pro-borders, pro-enforcement, pro-\uc2 American Supreme Court\uc2  justice that will recognize the importance of immigration,'' Mr. King said. ''There is no universal right to live in the United States.''\par \par \uc2 His sentiments stood in stark contrast to those of Cindy Nava, an immigrant from northern Mexico who was brought to the United States as a child by her parents. ''There was a point where we had faith in our court system in protecting immigrants,'' she said Wednesday. ''But I feel like everything is in jeopardy. I'm sort of speechless at the moment.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Nava, who now lives in Albuquerque and runs a nonprofit aimed at enhancing education opportunities for children, said the fear undocumented immigrants live in extends even to people who, like her, have recently become legal residents.\par \par \uc2 ''There's a growing sense that no one is safe unless you obtain citizenship,'' she said. ''Will the Supreme Court protect people like me? I just do not know.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump may have once called himself ''very pro-choice,'' but in the lead-up to the 2016 general election, he promised to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.\par \par \uc2 Still, the idea that the abortion rights case would ever fall had long seemed like a distant possibility to Ms. Mahle, 47, a program director at a North Carolina community college. A devoted Christian, she said that in 1998, she and her husband adopted a 12-year-old boy who she is thankful was not aborted when his biological mother became pregnant as a teenager.\par \par \uc2 ''I really believe that the Supreme Court probably plays the singular most important role in the entire country,'' she said. ''They are lifetime appointees. They have the responsibility to interpret the Constitution. And I believe that they have a responsibility also to have a moral and ethical compass to lead our country according to the Constitution, and not be swayed by political agendas or societal trends.''\par \par \uc2 Diane Derzis, the owner of the sole abortion clinic in Mississippi, anticipated the next court veering away from Roe. ''There's no question,'' Ms. Derzis said, her voice full of frustration. Abortion would be severely restricted ''within a year,'' she predicted.\par \par \uc2 ''And how many well-educated people have looked me in the eye and said that that cannot happen? Well, now our No. 5 is leaving,'' she said, referring to Justice Kennedy, who earned a reputation as the court's ''firewall'' for abortion rights.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Derzis, 64, had an abortion in Alabama as a 20-year-old married woman, one year after Roe was decided. ''I just knew that I wanted more than to have a baby and be stuck,'' she said. ''I knew that I wanted more out of my life and I wasn't ready to become a parent.''\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi, a Republican, signed into law a measure that would ban almost all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, but Ms. Derzis's clinic sued in federal court and blocked the law's implementation.\par \par \uc2 Justice Kennedy, who was appointed by President \uc2 Ronald Reagan\uc2  in 1988, has disappointed liberals over the years with his decisions as much as he has heartened them. But there is a sense on the left that things are about to change, and for the worse.\par \par \uc2 ''That swing vote has been critical in so many civil rights cases,'' said Ms. Clarke, the director of the \uc2 Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law\uc2 . ''These have been some devastating moments for people who care about the most vulnerable in the country. These last few weeks of the court are just a reminder of how high the stakes are.''\par \par \uc2 Though liberals see Mr. Kennedy's record on protections for ethnic and religious minorities in a mixed light, they have almost universally applauded his legacy on gay rights. His official opinions on high-profile cases like Lawrence v. Texas in 2003 and Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015, to name just a few, are fundamental pillars in the framework of legal protections afforded to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the United States today.\par \par \uc2 ''Millions of L.G.B.T. people have come out of the closet and they are able to pursue dreams they weren't to pursue a decade ago,'' said Camilla Taylor, the director of constitutional litigation at Lambda Legal. ''And by leaving at this time, he puts that legacy in jeopardy.''''\par \par \uc2 ''His words about the equal dignity of lesbian gay and bisexual people may mean a great deal less now,'' Ms. Taylor added. ''Given the track record for President Trump in nominating ideologues, we're extremely worried. Extremely worried.''\par \par \uc2 But in the divided nation there was also extreme relief. Paul Donahue, 53, is a financial adviser and part-owner of the Centennial Gun Club outside of Denver. He is a former mayor of Castle Rock, Colo., and has been a vocal supporter of gun rights.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Donahue said that he was thrilled to hear that the president would have a chance to appoint another justice, and that he was looking for ''someone who is more of constitutionalist'' to fill the slot.\par \par \uc2 But it wasn't just gun rights he wanted the next justice to protect -- it was everything he saw as under threat by justices appointed in the Obama administration who have ended up ''ruling in accordance with their feelings or emotions.'' Those rights, he said, include freedom of speech and freedom of religion.\par \par \uc2 ''I am forever grateful that President Trump is in that position and not President Clinton,'' he said, imagining the difference the nation would be in if the last presidential election had resulted in a victory for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . ''I see the Supreme Court as the last hope, and I think that's probably the best way to put it.''\par \par \uc2 Americans of all political persuasions, and on every side of social matters, are pondering what effect a newly constituted Supreme Court will have on issues such as abortion and gay rights.

SHEAR, HELENE COOPER and KATIE BENNER; Reporting was contributed by Thomas Kaplan, Eileen Sullivan, Robert Pear, Katie Rogers and Nicholas Fandos from Washington; Miriam Jordan and Caitlin Dickerson from New York; Simon Romero from Del Rio, Tex.; and Manny Fernandez from Brownsville, Tex. \par \uc2 1,783 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 June 2018\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The United States is preparing to shelter as many as 20,000 migrant children on four American military bases, a Pentagon spokesman said on Thursday, as federal officials struggled to carry out President Trump's order to keep immigrant families together after they are apprehended at the border.\par \par \uc2 The 20,000 beds at bases in Texas and Arkansas would house ''unaccompanied alien children,'' said a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Michael Andrews, although other federal agencies provided conflicting explanations about how the shelters would be used and who would be housed there. There were reports of widespread confusion on the border.\par \par \uc2 It was unclear whether the military housing would also house the parents of children in migrant families that have been detained, and officials at the White House, the \uc2 Defense Department\uc2  and the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  said on Thursday that they could not provide details.\par \par \uc2 The Pentagon announcement followed Mr. Trump's executive order on Wednesday to keep families together after they illegally cross the Mexican border into the United States. The order called for detaining families at the same location.\par \par \uc2 Democrats questioned the 20,000-bed plan. ''Is it even feasible?'' Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2  of New York, the minority leader, asked from the Senate floor.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for the migrants expressed concern about the prospect of vast settlements of families housed on military bases.\par \par \uc2 ''There's conflicting instructions being given,'' said Michelle Bran\u233\'00\'E9, the director of Migrant Rights and Justice at the Women's Refugee Commission. ''It's another example of this administration making these big, bold policy announcements with no plan for how they are going to implement them.''\par \par \uc2 ''It's adding to the chaos on the ground,'' she said. The tumult echoed the level of confusion among law enforcement agencies at airports after Mr. Trump barred travel for visitors from predominantly Muslim countries a week after he took office last year.\par \par \uc2 The president's order this week directed Pentagon officials to provide ''any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families'' and to ''construct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law.''\par \par \uc2 Defense Secretary \uc2 Jim Mattis\uc2  sidestepped questions on Wednesday about whether bases might be used as migrant camps, except to say: ''We have housed refugees. We have housed people thrown out of their homes by earthquakes and hurricanes.''\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, the Pentagon did not say which bases would be used for the shelters.\par \par \uc2 According to estimates, more than 2,300 children under 12 -- many of whom are toddlers and infants -- are being held in special ''tender age'' shelters.\par \par \uc2 A Trump administration spokesman said on Wednesday afternoon that the government would not immediately reunite those children with their parents. But that was contradicted Wednesday night by a more senior official.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Justice Department officials denied a report, apparently issued by officials from another agency, that prosecutions of immigrants traveling with families had been suspended.\par \par \uc2 Scrambling to adjust and comply with the president's order, the Border Patrol temporarily stopped referring immigration cases to the Justice Department for prosecution, setting off rumors that it would be halted altogether.\par \par \uc2 That forced the Justice Department to insist in a statement that ''there has been no change to the department's 'zero tolerance' policy to prosecute adults who cross our border illegally instead of claiming asylum at any port of entry at the border.''\par \par \uc2 Two internal Customs and Border Protection emails supplied to The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  showed similar confusion.\par \par \uc2 In one, sent at 9:54 p.m. Wednesday, Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings of the Border Patrol told supervisors that they could continue prosecution referrals for one parent who entered the country illegally if there was another adult migrant present.\par \par \uc2 But at 4:09 a.m. Thursday, he followed up, saying that agents should ''maintain family unity for multi-parent/adult families.''\par \par \uc2 Last week, federal officials opened a tent city outside El Paso to house up to 360 immigrant teenagers in custody. The temporary shelter site, at a border station in Tornillo, Tex., was still in use on Thursday, and its capacity remains 360, officials said.\par \par \uc2 In the border city of Del Rio, Tex., American officials continued deporting undocumented immigrants. Luis Alexis Morales, 20, of Veracruz State in eastern Mexico, said he was left in the middle of a bridge that links Del Rio with Ciudad Acu\u241\'00\'F1a, Mexico.\par \par \uc2 ''The Border Patrol caught me a week ago crossing the river near Piedras Negras,'' Mr. Morales said, referring to a city in northern Mexico across from Eagle Pass, Tex. He said American authorities had held him in jail for the past seven days before deporting him.\par \par \uc2 On the legal front, Mr. Trump's lawyers asked Judge Dolly M. Gee of Federal District Court in Los Angeles to modify a 1997 court ruling to allow the indefinite detention of families.\par \par \uc2 The ruling, known as the Flores settlement, requires that children must be released within 20 days. After that, they are to be sent to a family member or placed in the custody of a licensed, government-sponsored shelter.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department said the only way to prevent migrant children from being separated from their parents would be to detain entire families. It seemed to suggest that the practice of separating families could resume if the judge refused to alter the 1997 ruling.\par \par \uc2 It also echoed a 2016 argument by the Obama administration during a similar migrant surge. The judge and an appeals court denied the requests by the administration's lawyers.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, the Obama administration briefly sheltered migrant children at military bases in Texas, California and Oklahoma, establishing emergency housing for a steep increase in unaccompanied minors crossing the border. Around 7,000 children were housed on the bases for about three months until the number of migrants ebbed.\par \par \uc2 At the time, officials said the government was responding to a rise in the number of unaccompanied children fleeing violence in Central America. The military's role then was limited to housing the migrants and giving officials from the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  access to bases.\par \par \uc2 It was unclear on Thursday whether the military would play a more central role in Mr. Trump's plan.\par \par \uc2 At the White House, the president again lashed out at ''extremist, open-border Democrats,'' and he again falsely blamed Democrats for the political crisis that continues to roil his administration and was amplified in recent days by images and recordings of young children crying for their parents.\par \par \uc2 Choosing hard-edge remarks at a cabinet meeting before the House was scheduled to vote on overhauling immigration laws, Mr. Trump asked for Democratic lawmakers' support on the legislation, even as he said they were causing ''tremendous damage and destruction and lives.''\par \par \uc2 He repeated his false claim that Democrats forced family separations. ''They don't care about the children. They don't care about the injury. They don't care about the problems,'' Mr. Trump said. ''They don't care about anything.''\par \par \uc2 In a stream-of-consciousness commentary, the president also attacked Mexico for what he claimed was a failure to help stop illegal immigration into the United States. He said the trek through Mexico from Central America was like a walk through Central Park.\par \par \uc2 ''Mexico is doing nothing for us except taking our money and giving us drugs,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump said he has directed his administration to ''keep \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families together and to reunite these previously separated groups.'' But he offered no details about how the government intends to reunite the families.\par \par \uc2 Melania Trump, the first lady, visited a facility in McAllen, Tex., that is holding 55 children who have been separated from their parents.\par \par \uc2 She took a tour of the Upbring New Hope Children's Shelter, and in one classroom, she met with a group of children, some of whom spoke to her in English and others in Spanish, which was translated by a teacher.\par \par \uc2 Officials at the shelter said that the children held there were allowed to communicate with their families by phone twice a week.\par \par \uc2 ''How long are you here? Where are you from?'' asked Mrs. Trump, who traveled with \uc2 Alex M. Azar II\uc2 , the health and human services secretary. As she left, she said, ''Be kind and nice to others, O.K.? Nice to meet you.''\par \par \uc2 Back in Washington, House lawmakers had been scheduled to vote on Thursday on two broad immigration proposals, even as Mr. Trump's executive order relieved some of the pressure to act quickly.\par \par \uc2 The House rejected a hard-line immigration bill in a vote on Thursday afternoon, as had been expected. And Republican leaders delayed the vote on the second bill, which would provide a path to citizenship for young unauthorized immigrants while keeping migrant families together at the border.\par \par \uc2 That bill, a compromise between moderate and conservative Republicans, had been set for a vote early Thursday evening, but the vote will now take place next week, as it appeared destined to fail as Republicans remained at odds over immigration.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Trump reiterated on Thursday his position that congressional action would be the best way to resolve the border crisis, critics of the president announced that they would not wait for such a measure.\par \par \uc2 A coalition of 10 states filed a lawsuit aimed at making sure that the Trump administration stops separating children from their parents at the border.\par \par \uc2 ''President Trump yesterday signed an empty and meaningless order that claims to take back policies that he put in place himself as a political stunt,'' said \uc2 Xavier Becerra\uc2 , the California attorney general, who is a plaintiff in the suit. ''Meanwhile, these children, their parents and people around the world need answers regarding what comes next.''\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  has already filed a separate lawsuit that demands the government stop separating families and reunite the children who have already been separated with the parents who brought them into the United States.\par \par \uc2 Get politics and Washington news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the Morning Briefing newsletter.\par \par \uc2 President Trump criticized Democrats in a meeting on Thursday, hours before a scheduled House vote on immigration laws.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 American Airlines\uc2  asked the federal government on Wednesday to stop using its commercial planes for ''transporting children who have been separated from their families due to the current immigration policy.''\par \par \uc2 The announcement, which was posted on American's website, was the latest fallout from the Trump administration's decision to separate parents who have arrived at the southern border illegally from their children. Soon after American's announcement, and similar statements by other major airlines, President Trump signed an executive order to end the separation of families and detain parents and children together.\par \par \uc2 The involvement of the airline industry in the drama showed just how pervasive and passionate the opposition to the original policy had become. Several flight attendants for American, the world's largest airline, had posted testimony on public and private social media channels in recent days, describing how they had seen groups of Latino children on domestic flights, accompanied not by parents but by federal agents.\par \par \uc2 In a tweet Wednesday, \uc2 Frontier Airlines\uc2  stated that it would ''not knowingly allow our flights to be used to transport migrant children away from their families.'' \uc2 United Airlines\uc2  said it had told federal officials that they ''should not transport immigrant children'' who had been separated from their parents. \uc2 Southwest Airlines\uc2  asked that ''anyone'' involved in separating children from their parents not fly with them.\par \par \uc2 A press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, Tyler Q. Houlton, said it was unfortunate that airlines ''no longer want to partner with the brave men and women of D.H.S. to protect the traveling public, combat human trafficking, and to swiftly reunite unaccompanied \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children with their families.''\par \par \uc2 ''Despite being provided facts on this issue, these airlines clearly do not understand our immigration laws and the longstanding devastating loopholes that have caused the crisis at our southern border,'' Mr. Houlton said.\par \par \uc2 It is difficult to discern whether the children seen by the \uc2 American Airlines\uc2  flight crews were those who had been separated from their parents under the administration's ''zero tolerance'' policy. Indeed, the airline, in its statement, said that it ''has no way to know what kinds of government passengers it transports.''\par \par \uc2 ''While we have carried refugees for nonprofits and the government, many of whom are being reunited with family or friends, we have no knowledge that the federal government has used American to transport children who have been separated from their parents due to the recent immigration policy, but we would be extremely disappointed to learn that is the case,'' the statement said.\par \par \uc2 It continued: ''We have therefore requested the federal government to immediately refrain from using American for the purpose of transporting children who have been separated from their families due to the current immigration policy. We have no desire to be associated with separating families, or worse, to profit from it.''\par \par \uc2 The number of children being moved on domestic flights is unclear. The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  contacted media offices of both the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  and the agency under its jurisdiction, \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , but only received the statement from Mr. Houlton in response.\par \par \uc2 The Times also talked to several flight attendants who said they had been disturbed by seeing Latino children on \uc2 American Airlines\uc2  flights, accompanied by government agents. But they declined to give their names, for fear of retaliation.\par \par \uc2 The topic has been a searing one for flight attendants. \uc2 Sara Nelson\uc2  is the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines (American's flight attendants are represented by a different union). In a statement, Ms. Nelson acknowledged that the topic was a heated one among members.\par \par \uc2 ''This national discussion and response is being felt on the planes and discussed among crews,'' Ms. Nelson said in a statement. ''Some are struggling with the question of participating in a process that they feel deeply is immoral.''\par \par \uc2 For flight attendants, the mere possibility that they could be involved in a process that is increasing, rather than ameliorating, children's fears runs counter to one of their core missions. They are regularly entrusted with the care of unaccompanied minors, and take pride in making them feel welcome, many say. Jill Sanders, 51, an American Airlines flight attendant with three decades of experience, said that they were also trained to recognize and report cases of children who might be victims of human trafficking.\par \par \uc2 ''We all can tell at least one story of holding a child while their mother goes to the bathroom on the airplane,'' she said, ''and know what it's like when their mother is gone for one minute and 30 seconds.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Sanders said she had not personally seen any children who appeared to be migrants separated from their families. But she said she had read several accounts from her colleagues that had been posted on a private \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page.\par \par \uc2 She said that she deemed a number of the posts on the private \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page to be ''credible and verifiable,'' given her personal knowledge of the writers and the details of the flights they described.\par \par \uc2 ''Personally, I cannot imagine how I would justify, in my own mind, my decades-long experience of giving comfort to a child who is upset with being required to participate in the transport of a child away from its mother,'' Ms. Sanders said.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, a Dallas-based flight attendant named Hunt Palmquist published an essay on the website of The Houston Chronicle.\par \par \uc2 ''Several weeks ago, I worked two flights (one to San Antonio and the other to McAllen) which proved to be two of the most disturbing flights I've ever experienced in my career,'' wrote Mr. Palmquist, who did not disclose which airline he worked for. ''On board these particular flights were ICE agents and migrant children (approximately four to eleven years old) who had been separated from their families and were being flown to a 'relocation' site.''\par \par \uc2 It was not clear how Mr. Palmquist determined that the children were ones who had been separated from their families by the ''zero-tolerance'' policy. He wrote that a co-worker had been told by immigration agents that children on one flight were part of a soccer team, but that the agents later admitted to the co-worker that ''they were, indeed children who were being relocated to assigned camps.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Palmquist, who has worked in the airline industry for 29 years, said that he would refuse, in the future, to work on any flight ''with children who've been separated from their families.''\par \par \uc2 ''Since working the two flights, the images of those helpless children have burned into my psyche. The little children whose faces were full of fear, confusion, sadness and exhaustion left me somewhat traumatized as it occurred to me a few weeks later that I might as well have been a collaborator in their transport.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020180621ee6l00031\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump and top administration officials have continued to defend their practice of breaking up families who arrive at the border in the face of bipartisan outcry, criticism from the United Nations and a lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 They've denied the existence of a policy and that they were the first to enforce it, pointed to surges in illegal immigration and fraud, trotted out decades-old court cases and human trafficking laws, blamed Democrats and even cited the Bible.\par \par \uc2 Here are their defenses, fact-checked.\par \par \uc2 what was said\par \par \uc2 ''We have to get the Democrats to go ahead and work with us. Because as a result of Democrat-supported loopholes in our federal laws, most \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families and minors from Central America who arrive unlawfully at the border cannot be detained together or removed together, only released. These are crippling loopholes that cause family separation, which we don't want.''\par \par \uc2 -- Mr. Trump, in remarks on Tuesday to the \uc2 National Federation of Independent Business\par \par \uc2 False.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump is again wrongly claiming that Democrats are responsible for ''loopholes'' that necessitate breaking apart families at the border.\par \par \uc2 The White House cites a 1997 court settlement and a 2008 law as these loopholes. Neither mandates detaining parents and separating children from their families.\par \par \uc2 Under the court settlement, the government agreed to quickly release children under an established preference that ranks for custody. In 2016, an appeals court held that the government must do the same for children who arrive with families.\par \par \uc2 The 2008 law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, requires the government to transfer children from countries other than Mexico and Canada to the care and custody of the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  and then place them in formal removal proceedings. It does not apply to children who travel with family.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump is also wrong that Central American families who enter the United States illegally cannot be removed together. Like individual adults, families with children can be placed under a process known as expedited removal -- unless they seek asylum.\par \par \uc2 Through expedited removal, immigration officials can quickly remove an unauthorized immigrant from the country without having to go through an immigration court. If the families do make a claim of credible fear and are denied, they are then placed into removal proceedings.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Trump said, his administration could release one or both parents with their children. But it has instead chosen to prosecute people who cross the border illegally under a new ''zero tolerance'' policy, leading to the separation of children from their parents.\par \par \uc2 what was said\par \par \uc2 ''We now have thousands of judges -- border judges -- thousands and thousands. And, by the way, when we release the people, they never come back to the judge anyway.''\par \par \uc2 -- Mr. Trump\par \par \uc2 This is exaggerated.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump rejected a proposal from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, to end family separation by hiring more immigration judges by suggesting that doing so would be useless.\par \par \uc2 There are about 350 immigration judges in the United States, according to the Justice Department, not ''thousands'' of ''border judges.'' (There are just 1,300 sitting federal judges in all.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump is also wrong that immigrants ''never'' appear for a hearing before an immigration court. Around 20 to 40 percent of immigrants have failed to show up at a hearing over the past five years, data from the Justice Department shows.\par \par \uc2 what was said\par \par \uc2 ''The Obama administration, the Bush administration all separated families at the -- They absolutely did.''\par \par \uc2 -- The secretary of homeland security, \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2 , in a news conference on Monday\par \par \uc2 This is misleading.\par \par \uc2 While previous administrations did break up families, it was rare, according to former officials and immigration experts. The Trump administration, by contrast, has knowingly enacted the practice that some officials have characterized as a deterrence against illegal entry.\par \par \uc2 In 2005, President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  introduced Operation Streamline, which, like the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy, referred for prosecution immigrants illegally crossing the border. Unlike the Trump administration, the Bush administration made an exception for parents with children.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security could not provide data on how many children were separated from their parents in previous administrations.\par \par \uc2 Jeh Johnson, Ms. Nielsen's predecessor under President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , said in a recent interview with \uc2 NPR\uc2  that it was possible that families were separated, ''but not as a matter of policy or practice.''\par \par \uc2 ''I can't say that it never happened,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''There may have been some exigent situation, some emergency. There may have been some doubt about whether the adult accompanying the child was in fact the parent of the child.''\par \par \uc2 Cecilia Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz\uc2 , Mr. Obama's top domestic policy adviser, told The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  that the Obama administration had decided against separating children from their parents because ''the morality of it was clear -- that's not who we are.''\par \par \uc2 A 2016 report from the \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2  details the stories of children detained with one parent, but separated from the other. One woman was detained with her children and separated from her nephew, who was transferred to the care of a foster family.\par \par \uc2 But neither the Bush nor Obama administration had a policy that had the effect of widespread family separation, said Sarah Pierce of the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 . ''Nothing like what the Trump administration is doing has occurred before,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 what was said\par \par \uc2 ''In the last five months, we have a 314 percent increase in adults and children arriving at the border, fraudulently claiming to be a family unit.''\par \par \uc2 -- Ms. Nielsen\par \par \uc2 This requires context.\par \par \uc2 As The Times has previously reported, Ms. Nielsen's statistical claim is correct, according to figures released from the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . But it is not evidence of rampant fraud.\par \par \uc2 There were 46 cases of fraudulent family claims in the 2017 fiscal year. In just the first five months of the 2018 fiscal year, there were 191 cases. That is a 315 percent increase, but the comparison is not year to year. And those instances make up less than 1 percent of the families apprehended at the border.\par \par \uc2 WHAT WAS SAID\par \par \uc2 ''D.H.S. is not separating families legitimately seeking asylum at ports of entry.''\par \par \uc2 -- Ms. Nielsen\par \par \uc2 ''If they enter the country at a port of entry and there are many of those along the border, they are not violating the law. The mother or father in that circumstance would not be prosecuted and the families are staying together. They're -- presumably, they are claiming an asylum and that's -- they would not be prosecuted and not be separated.''\par \par \uc2 -- Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in an interview on Monday with Fox News\par \par \uc2 This requires context.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  has filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Congolese woman who says her daughter was taken from her when she applied for asylum at a port of entry.\par \par \uc2 As The Times and others have reported, asylum seekers are also being turned away when they do present themselves at ports of entry. Even when immigrants improperly cross the border, they can still legally seek asylum.\par \par \uc2 But the administration's zero-tolerance policy subjects all who cross the border illegally, including asylum seekers, to prosecution.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020180620ee6k00048\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Homeland Security secretary, \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2  , addressed on Monday the zero-tolerance immigration policy amid growing outcry over the forced separation it is causing to families apprehended at the border.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Nielsen opened with a statement on the policy and then answered questions from reporters in the White House briefing room.\par \par \uc2 [Read our latest coverage of President Trump's immigration policy and the separation of families at the border.]\par \par \uc2 The following is a transcript of that appearance.\par \par \uc2 _____________________\par \par \uc2 SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS\uc2  , White House press secretary: ... To answer your questions on this topic, I invited Secretary of Homeland Security \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2  and the Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to the podium. And as always, I'll be back up afterwards to take questions on other news of the day. Thanks.\par \par \uc2 KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, secretary of homeland security: Well, good afternoon. It is my pleasure to be here, because I would love to see if I can help explain some of what is going on and give you some of the facts. I know there have been a lot put out there but hopefully we can clarify some things today. I just wanted to start by thanking the sheriffs of the United States. I had the privilege of speaking to them this morning at the National Sheriffs' Association Conference. We are so thankful for their partnership at D.H.S. and all they do to protect our community. So I thank them.\par \par \uc2 So, I want to provide you an update on the illegal immigration crisis on the southern border and the efforts the administration is taking to solve this crisis and to stop the flood of illegal immigrants, drugs, contraband and crime coming across the border.\par \par \uc2 So let's just start with a few numbers and facts. So, in the last three months we've seen illegal immigration on our southern border exceed 50,000 people each month, multiples over each month last year. Since this time last year, there has been a 325 percent increase in unaccompanied alien children and a 435 percent increase in family units entering the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Over the last ten years, there has been a 1700 percent increase in asylum claims, resulting in asylum backlog of 600,000 cases. Since 2013, the United States has admitted more than half a million \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  minors and family units from Central America, most of whom today are at large in the United States. At the same time, large criminal organizations such as MS-13 have violated our borders and gained a deadly foothold within the United States. This entire crisis, just to be clear, is not new. It is been occurring and expanded over many decades. But currently it is the exclusive product of loopholes in our federal immigration laws that prevent \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  minors and family members from being detained and removed to their home countries.\par \par \uc2 In other words, these loopholes create a functionally open border. Apprehension without detention and removal is not border security. We have repeatedly called on Congress to close the loopholes. I myself have met with as many members as have been willing to meet with me, and I testified seven times, and I will continue to make myself available to ask that they work with us to solve this crisis.\par \par \uc2 Yet the voices most loudly criticizing the enforcement of our current laws are those whose policies created this crisis and whose policies perpetrate it. In particular, we need to reform three major loopholes. Let me quickly walk you through them.\par \par \uc2 First, we need to amend the 2008 Trafficking Victims Prevention Reauthorization Act, or T.V.P.R., which is much easier to say. This law encourages families to put children in the hands of smugglers to bring them alone on this dangerous trek northward. And make no mistake, we've talked about this before: This trek is dangerous and deadly.\par \par \uc2 Second, we need to reform our asylum laws to end the systemic abuse of our asylum system and stop fraud. Right now, our asylum system fails to assist asylum seekers who legitimately need it. We are a country of compassion and heart. We must fix this system so that those who truly need asylum can, in fact, receive it.\par \par \uc2 Third, we need to amend the Flores Settlement Agreement and recent expansions which would allow for family detention during the removal process. And we need Congress to fully fund our ability to hold families together through the immigration process. And until these loopholes are closed by Congress, it is not possible as a matter of law to detain and remove whole family units who arrive illegally in the United States. Congress and the courts created this problem and congress alone can fix it.\par \par \uc2 Until then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States. Those who criticize the enforcement of our laws have offered only one countermeasure: open borders, the quick release of all illegal alien families and the decision not to enforce our laws. This policy would be disastrous. Its prime beneficiary would be the smuggling organizations themselves, and the prime victims would be the children, who would be plunged into the smuggling machines on the trip north.\par \par \uc2 There is a lot of misinformation about what D.H.S. is and is not doing as it relates to families at the border. And I want to correct the record here. Here are the facts.\par \par \uc2 First, this administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border. We have a statutory responsibility that we take seriously to protect alien children from human smuggling, trafficking and other criminal actions while enforcing our immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 We have a long existing policy -- multiple administrations have followed -- that outline when we may take action to protect children. We will separate those who claim to be a parent and child if we cannot determine a familiar or custodial relationship exists. For example, if there is no documentation to confirm the claimed relationship between an adult and a child. We do so if the parent is a national security, public, or safety risk, including when there are criminal charges at issue and it may not be appropriate to maintain the family in detention together.\par \par \uc2 We also separate a parent and child if the adult is suspected of human trafficking. There are cases where minors have been used and trafficked by unrelated adults in an effort to avoid detention. And I'd stop here to say in the last five months, we have a 314 percent increase in adults and children arriving at the border fraudulently, claiming to be a family unit. This is obviously of concern.\par \par \uc2 And separation can occur when the parent is charged with human smuggling. Under those circumstances, we would detain the parent in an appropriate secure detention facility separate from the child. What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law. Everyone is subject to prosecution. When D.H.S. refers a case against a parent or legal guardian for criminal prosecution, the parent or legal guardian will be placed into the \uc2 U.S. Marshals Service\uc2  custody for pretrial determination, pursuant to an order by a federal judge, and any accompanied child will be transferred to the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  and will be reclassified as an unaccompanied alien child.\par \par \uc2 That is in accordance with the T.V.P.R.A., a law that was passed by Congress, and following a court order, neither of which actions the Trump administration has taken. And let's be clear: If an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States, they would go to jail and they would be separated from their family. This is not a controversial idea.\par \par \uc2 Second, children in D.H.S. and H.H.S. custody are being well taken care of. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement provides meals, medical care and educational services to these children. They are provided temporary shelter, and H.H.S. works hard to find a parent, relative or foster home to care for these children. Parents can still communicate with their children through phone calls and video conferencing.\par \par \uc2 And a parent who is released from custody can be a sponsor and ask H.H.S. to release the child back into their care. Further, these minors can still apply for asylum under U.S. immigration law, if eligible. We take allegations of mistreatment seriously. And I want to stress this point: We investigate, we hold those accountable when and if it should occur. We have some of the highest detention standards in the country. Claiming these children and their parents are treated inhumanely is not true, and completely disrespects the hard working men and women at the \uc2 Office of Refugee Resettlement\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Third, parents who entered illegally are, by definition, criminals. Illegal entry is a crime as determined by Congress. By entering our country illegally, often in dangerous circumstances, illegal immigrants put their children at risk.\par \par \uc2 Fourth, C.B.P. and I.C.E. officers are trained to care for minors in their custody. D.H.S. and H.H.S. treats all individuals in its custody with dignity and respect and complies with all laws and policy. This reinforces and reiterates the need to consider the best interest of the children, and mandates adherence to established protocols to protect at-risk populations to include standards for the transport and treatment of minors in D.H.S. and H.H.S. custody.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, all U.S. Border Patrol personnel on the southwest border are bilingual. Every last one of them. They are directed to clearly explain the relevance process to apprehended individuals and provide detainees with written documentation in both Spanish and English that lays out the process and appropriate phone numbers to contact. And finally, D.H.S. is not separating families legitimately seeking asylum at ports of entry. If an adult enters at a port of entry and claims asylum, they will not face prosecution for illegal entry. They have not committed a crime by coming to the port of entry.\par \par \uc2 As I mentioned, D.H.S. does have a responsibility to protect minors and, in that case as well, we will only separate the family if we cannot determine there is a familial relationship, if the child may be at risk with the parent or legal guardian, or if the parent or legal guardian is referred for prosecution. We have a duty to protect the American people and it is one that I take very seriously.\par \par \uc2 Here is the bottom line: D.H.S. is no longer ignoring the law. We're enforcing the laws as they exist on the books. As long as illegal entry remains a criminal offense, D.H.S. will not look the other way. D.H.S. will faithfully execute the laws enacted by Congress, as we are sworn to do. As I said earlier today, surely it is the beginning of the unraveling of democracy when the body who makes the laws, instead of changing them, tells the enforcement body not to enforce the law.\par \par \uc2 I ask Congress to ask this week so that we could secure our borders and uphold our humanitarian ideas. These two missions should not be pitted against each other. If we close the loopholes, we could accomplish both. Before I take questions, I just want to ask that in your reporting, please consider the men and women of D.H.S. who are dedicated law enforcement officers and who often put their lives at risk. Let's remember their sacrifice and commitment to this country. And with that I'll take some questions. Yes.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Secretary Nielsen, what you talked about there, D.H.S. is no longer ignoring the law, you're calling on Congress to change the law. I mean, that is the big message here.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: Yes.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Members of Congress on the Democratic side say that you are using children as a lever to try to get them to take legislative action. What do you say to that?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I say that is a very cowardly response. It is clearly within their power to make the laws and change the laws. They should do so.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: You have seen the photos of children in cages? Have you heard the audio clip of these children wailing that just came out today?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I have -- I have not seen something that came out today but I have been to detention centers and, again, I would reference you to our standards and I would reference you to the care provided not just by the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  , but by the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  when they get to H.H.S.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: But is that the image of this country that you want out there, children in cages?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: The image I want of this country is an immigration system that secures our border and upholds our humanitarian ideals. Congress needs to fix it.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: I want to give you a chance to respond to \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2 . In an op-ed, she says this is cruel, she supports an application of the law. Even the current first lady, Melania Trump, has said we should be a nation of laws, we should do so with heart. Do you have anything you want to tell them, do you believe they are misunderstanding the situation or do you believe there is any component of this policy, which as you've outlined other administrations have done but you are using it in a way that is more intense and creates the separation issue.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: What my response would be is calling attention to this matter is important. This is a very serious issue that has resulted after years and years of Congress not taking action. So I would thank them both for their comments, I would thank them both for their concerns, I share their concerns, but Congress is the one that needs to fix this.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: The policy is not by your definition in any way cruel?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: It is not a policy. Our policy at D.H.S. is to do what we're sworn to do which is to enforce the law.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: I'm following up on Megan's question there. Former first lady \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2  compared this to Japanese internment during World War II, one of the darkest days in the nation's history. Do you believe that the effect of this policy, so not the law, but the effect of it on separating children from families in those specific instances is moral? Is it ethical? Is it American?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: What I believe is that we should exercise our democratic rights as Americans and fix the problem. It is a problem and let's fix it. Yes.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: How is this not child abuse?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: Which -- Be more specific, please. Enforcing the law?\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: These images that Cecilia was talking about and the sounds that we've seen from the big box stores, the Walmarts and the other stores. When you see this, how is this not specifically child abuse for these innocent children who are indeed being separated from their parents?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: So I want to be clear on a couple of other things. The vast majority, vast, vast majority of children who are in the care of H.H.S. right now -- 10,000 of the 12,000 -- were sent here alone by their parents. That is when they were separated. So somehow we've conflated everything. But there is two separate issues. 10,000 of those currently in custody were sent by their parents with strangers to undertake a completely dangerous and deadly travel alone. We now care for them. We have high standards. We give them meals, we give them education, we give them medical care. There is videos, there is TVs, I visited the detention centers myself -- that would be my answer to that question.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: If I could follow up, though. For the hundreds that are not included in there -- you said 10,000 -- but for the hundreds that we have seen, perhaps up to 2,000, are there any examples of child abuse that you believe and how could this not be child abuse for the people who are taken from their parents? Not the ones who are sent here with their parents blessing or with the smuggler, the people taken from their parents.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: Unfortunately, I'm not in any position to deal with hearsay stories. If someone has a specific allegation, as I always do when I testify, I ask they provide that information to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  . We will look into it. Of course we do not want any situation where a child is not completely adequately taken care of. Yes.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: A couple of questions. One, why is the government only releasing images of the boys being held? Where are the girls? Where are the young toddlers?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I don't know. I'm not familiar with those particular images so I would have --\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Do you know where they are? Do you know where the girls are? Do you know where the young toddlers are?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: We have children in D.H.S. care both, but as you know, most of the children after 72 hours are transferred to H.H.S. So I don't know what pictures you're referencing but I would have to refer you to H.H.S.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: We've seen images of boys but we just haven't seen any of the girls, any of the young toddlers and you're saying they are being well cared for. So how could you make that claim if you don't know where they are?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: It is not that I don't know where they are. I'm saying that the vast majority of children are held by \uc2 Health and Human Services\uc2  . We transfer them after 72 hours. I don't know what pictures you're speaking about. But perhaps they're --\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Pictures have been released to the public, they've been aired all over national television.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: O.K., by D.H.S. or H.H.S.?\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: By [inaudible] .H.S.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: So let's find out from H.H.S. I don't think there is anything other than [cross talk] the pictures --\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: [cross talk] released by your department. I mean, they've have been aired all over national television throughout the day, the kids being held in the cages. We've only seen the boys.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I will, I will look into that. I'm not aware that there's another picture. Yes.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Let me ask, secretary, just to follow up very quickly, because you continue to insist that this is something that Congress can change and yet --\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: Yes.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: This is something enacted after the attorney general announced the zero-tolerance policy. This never happened before he announced the zero-tolerance policy.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: That is actually not true. The last administration -- the Obama administration and the Bush administration all separated families at the --\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: [Inaudible question]\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: They absolutely did. Their rate was less than ours but they absolutely did do this. This is not new.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: [inaudible] unaccompanied minors, there is no doubt about that. But this --\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: They separated families.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Separating kids at this rate from their parents is something new and specific to this administration once the attorney general announced the zero-tolerance policy. So why doesn't the president pick up the phone and change the policy? He said that he hates it.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I think what the president is trying to do is find a long-term fix. So why don't we have Congress change the laws --\par \par \uc2 [inaudible cross talk]\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: No, Congress could fix this tomorrow. [cross talk] Yes, I think you were next, right?\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Madam secretary, President Trump had a lot to say the last few days about immigration, but he's offered no compassion to the families that are being separated at the border. Do you know why that is and why won't he simply pause your department's enforcement of this administration policy until Congress reaches that long-term fix so that these families can be reunited.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: He has been attempting to work with Congress since he's been in office. He's made it very clear that we will enforce the laws of the United States as long as this administration is here. As part of that, he has continually reached out to Congress to fix this. And I think what you've seen him do in the last few days is that. Is continue to tell Congress, please work with us, the system is broken. The only people that benefit from the system right now are the smugglers, the traffickers, those who are peddling drugs and terrorists. So let's fix the system.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: That didn't answer the question. Does he feel any compassion for the families being separated? He's talked about the parents being possible criminals, he's blamed it on Democrats, he's offered no words of compassion.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I think he has said in tweets that he would like Congress to act to end the underlying laws that require the separation.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Madam Secretary, it seemed like a couple of days ago both the president and your tweets -- that the main posture or point was to say this is not the administration's policy, but it seems like in the last couple -- well today -- that the message is a little bit different and to say this is our policy but it is because either we believe it is a deterrent or we don't believe we have the resources to move families entirely. And I'm just wondering -- I want to make sure we get the reporting right -- which of those is the most precise way to describe how the administration feels? And given the blowback by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats, are you considering rethinking this based on feedback or is this the administration's position going forward, period paragraph?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: The laws prohibit us from detaining families while they go through prosecution for illegally entering the border and while they go through prosecutions for immigration proceedings. If we close the loopholes, we can keep the families together. Which is what they did in the last administration until a court ruled that we can no longer do that. After 20, days we have to release both unaccompanied children and accompanied children. Which means that we cannot detain families together. The only option is to not enforce the law at all.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Ok, so going back to these two questions from Kristen and Margaret -- you said that you want Congress to close some loopholes. With that, you also said that you want to make this work. Now are these kids being used as pawns for a wall? Many people are asking that and Democrats are saying this is your discretion and there is no law that said that this White House could separate parents from their children.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: The kids are being used by pawns by the smugglers and the traffickers. Again, let's just pause to think about this statistic: 314 percent increase in adults showing up with kids that are not a family unit. Those are traffickers, those are smugglers and that is MS-13, those are criminals, those are abusers.\par \par \uc2 [cross talk]\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: So -- thank you -- all I'm trying to say is the closing that loophole will enable us to detain families together throughout the proceeding, as they've done in previous administrations.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Madam Secretary, can you definitively say, are the children being used as pawns against -- for a wall? Yes or no? Can you say yes or no to that?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: The children are not being used as a pawn. We're trying to protect the children, which is why I'm asking Congress to act.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: [Inaudible] as the legal framework for the decisions that your administration is taking? Are what we're seeing -- the pictures, the audio, the stories -- are they an intended consequence of the administration's decision making or unintended consequence?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I think that they reflect the focus of those who post such pictures and narratives. The narratives we don't see are the narratives of the crime, of the opioids, of the smugglers, of who are people killed by gang members, of American children who are recruited and then when they lose the drugs they're tased and beaten. So we don't have a balanced view of what's happening, but what's happening at the border is the border is being overrun by those who have no right to cross it. As I said before, if you are seeking asylum, go to a port of entry. You do not need to break the law of the United States to seek asylum.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: People are being turned away from ports of entry.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: That actually is incorrect. We have limited resources, we have multiple missions at C.B.P. and what we do is based on the very high standards we have, if we do not have enough bed space, if we do not have enough medical personnel on staff, if we do not have enough caretakers on staff, then we will tell people that come to the border that they need to come back. We are not turning them away. We are saying we want to take care of you in the right way, right now we do not have the resources at this particular moment in time, come back.\par \par \uc2 [cross talk]\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Thank you very much. Are you intending for this to play out as it is playing out? Are you intending for parents to be separated from children? Are you intending to send a message?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I find that offensive. No. Because why would I ever create a policy that purposely does that.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Perhaps as a deterrence?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: No. The way that it works --\par \par \uc2 [cross talk]\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: That is not the question that you asked me. But the answer is, it is a law passed by the \uc2 United States Congress\uc2  . Rather than fixing the law, Congress is asking those of us who enforce the law to turn our backs on the law and not enforce the law. It is not an answer. The answer is to fix the laws.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Will the administration refrain from its current policy if Congress were to pass something that is close to what you want, or will it continue to require the separation of parents from children until the president gets exactly what he wants?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: If Congress closes the loopholes, some of which -- many of which are closed in the two bills that we hope are taken up this week by the House, then they close the loopholes and the families will stay together throughout the proceedings. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Get politics and Washington news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2  , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the Morning Briefing newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020180619ee6j0004t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PASADENA, Calif. -- A few weeks ago, Juan Carlos Osorio, the coach of Mexico's national soccer team, sat in the sunny courtyard of a Beverly Hills hotel, nursing a cup of coffee and reliving the moment in 2016 that very nearly derailed his 20-year journey from a small club on Staten Island to his first World Cup.\par \par \uc2 Osorio, 57, had just presided over the most humiliating defeat in Mexico's history, a 7-0 demolition by Chile in the quarterfinals of the Copa Am\u233\'00\'E9rica, the world's oldest international tournament. It was the sort of loss that gets a coach fired, especially in Mexico -- provided Osorio didn't quit first.\par \par \uc2 ''I went into the locker room, splashed cold water on my face, loosened my tie and told my team, 'If there is no trust in our work then I will go out there right now and tell everyone I resign,''' he recalled.\par \par \uc2 Osorio's players stood behind him, and, to the surprise and dismay of the Mexican fans and news media, so did the country's soccer federation. Twelve full-time and interim coaches in 12 years were apparently enough, at least for the moment.\par \par \uc2 The decision may be vindicated in the coming weeks, as El Tri, which opens play on Sunday against Germany at the 2018 World Cup, tries to advance beyond the round of 16 for the first time since 1986. Or it may not be. In which case, there's no mystery about whom the nation will blame for another underachieving performance: their Colombian-born, United States-educated coach.\par \par \uc2 Osorio has been under more or less sustained attack from the moment he was awarded the Mexico job in the fall of 2015. El Tri legends came forward like a Greek chorus to denounce the choice, mocking him as a physical trainer (which he was early in his career), putting air quotes around his ''titles'' and insisting that there were dozens of better options in Mexico alone.\par \par \uc2 In the two and a half years since then, Osorio has won more than two-thirds of the games he has coached, and yet the chants for his ouster -- ''Fuera Osorio!'' -- have only grown louder.\par \par \uc2 ''If Osorio is such a good coach, why isn't he managing the Colombian team?'' said Hugo S\u225\'00\'E1nchez, a former national team coach and Mexico star.\par \par \uc2 Fans complain that Osorio is too analytical -- ''Profesor'' they call him, not entirely out of respect. They wave off the many teams Osorio has beaten as second rate, and fixate on the handful of games he has lost. Most of all, they complain that he is not Mexican.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a matter of identity,'' S\u225\'00\'E1nchez said. The relentlessly negative Mexican news media, which is given very little access to Osorio and the national team, only amplifies these complaints.\par \par \uc2 ''El Tri Leaves Doubts on Its Way to Russia,'' was a typical headline assessing the team after it tied Wales here, 0-0, in a warm-up match recently before the Cup.\par \par \uc2 Osorio has clearly reached his limit. During an interview in May and one last year in New York, he was remarkably candid about the untenability of his position.\par \par \uc2 ''They're not happy with us winning,'' he said. ''We have to win and humiliate the opposition. There is no country in the world that keeps so much pressure on a national team coach. There is none.''\par \par \uc2 As much as anything, this is a function of Mexico's modern World Cup history.\par \par \uc2 Since 1994, the team has never failed to advance out of its group. It has also never managed to win a knockout game, losing six consecutive times in the round of 16 in a highlight reel of soccer heartbreak: Mexico has gone down on penalty kicks (Bulgaria, 1994), on a botched offsides call (Argentina, 2010) and on a penalty that wasn't (the Netherlands, 2014).\par \par \uc2 It is a record of failure that in most other nations would produce a certain kind of fatalism, if only as a form of self-protection. But to Mexico's fans, each World Cup disappointment has increased the size of the debt they feel is owed to them, and ratcheted up the heat on the team's coach to finally collect it -- to right this cosmic wrong and validate a nation's unwavering faith.\par \par \uc2 In Mexico, the blending of fantasy and reality is not just a literary tradition. ''To coach Mexico you have to be sort of a magician, you have to sell illusions,'' the Mexican novelist and soccer columnist Juan Villoro said.\par \par \uc2 Going into this World Cup, Mexico's fantasies may be more vivid than ever. With more than a dozen of its members playing in top leagues around Europe, the Mexico team is considered one of its best.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the quadrennial curse looms. Mexico had a punishing draw: It shares a group with the defending champion, Germany, and strong teams from Sweden and South Korea. If Mexico finishes second, a likely outcome, it probably will play Brazil, one of the most heavily favored teams to win the tournament, in the round of 16.\par \par \uc2 The glare also will be unusually intense. El Tri has long been America's Other Team: It plays most of its friendlies on American soil, selling out stadiums, such as the Rose Bowl, that the United States national team could never hope to fill.\par \par \uc2 The Mexican top level league, Liga MX, routinely draws larger TV audiences than \uc2 Major League Soccer\uc2  or England's Premier League. With the American team failing to qualify for the World Cup, Fox and \uc2 ESPN\uc2  are pouring resources into exhaustive coverage of Mexico in both English and Spanish.\par \par \uc2 On top of all this, Osorio knows he is auditioning for his next job. He will almost certainly leave Mexico after the World Cup, whether by his own choice or the federation's.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not that I'm not happy with the players -- I'm very happy with the players -- but the environment is just unbelievable,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Osorio makes no secret about his desire to coach the United States team -- ''that's a job that any manager would like to have,'' he said -- and he is, in some respects, the perfect candidate for it.\par \par \uc2 He has the international pedigree, having coached in Colombia, Mexico and even England, as an assistant at Manchester City. As a native Spanish speaker steeped in Latin America's soccer culture, he might give the United States an edge it badly needs in the competition for young stars of Mexican descent who live in the United States and can choose to play for either national team.\par \par \uc2 But Osorio also has a deep personal connection to the United States. It is where he met his wife, and where both of his teenage sons were born.\par \par \uc2 He first came to the United States at age 26, after an injury cut short his playing career in Colombia and Brazil. He attended a small college in Dubuque, Iowa, but dropped out after a semester and moved to New York City. An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , he cobbled together a living in construction and food service.\par \par \uc2 Osorio went back to school and regained his legal status, finishing his degree in exercise science and playing soccer at Southern Connecticut State University, before returning to New York to work as a personal trainer in Queens.\par \par \uc2 In 1998, at age 37, he landed his first soccer job, as a conditioning coach for the now-defunct Staten Island Vipers in the United Soccer League. Over the next two decades, he bounced from country to country and from club to club, always seeking the next opportunity to coach at a higher level.\par \par \uc2 As a coach, Osorio is as much a product of the United States as he is of Latin America. His high-intensity, situation-centric training sessions are modeled after a Michael Jordan-era Chicago Bulls practice that he managed to talk his way into during his time in Iowa. And he has tried to import some of the physicality and competitiveness of American sports culture to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 He is always changing his lineup, often benching stars, both to better exploit his competition and so that his players won't become complacent. This is another source of his unpopularity among a Mexican public that sees his refusal to commit to a single group of players as a lack of confidence in the team. Osorio has little patience for the criticism, which he considers emblematic of Mexico's problematic attitude toward soccer.\par \par \uc2 ''We think we can win by just being talented; we don't like really the competition,'' Osorio says. ''We are more into diving, faking and talking bad about other people, creating animosities and creating problems.''\par \par \uc2 Stylistically, Osorio is everything his beloved predecessor, Miguel Herrera -- last seen rolling around on the grass of the 2014 World Cup in fits of operatic fury and elation, before being fired for punching a broadcaster -- was not. He takes extensive notes on the sideline in color-coded pens, quotes the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges and is prone to lengthy digressions about the chemistry of the human brain.\par \par \uc2 Without the pedigree of a successful playing career, the calling card for most professional soccer coaches, Osorio's rise has been fueled by an obsessive quest to master the tactical aspects of the game.\par \par \uc2 He persuaded \uc2 Manchester United\uc2  to allow him to observe its practices when Sir \uc2 Alex Ferguson\uc2  was still in charge there; and he not only befriended a Liverpool family whose home overlooked the team's training ground, he moved in with them.\par \par \uc2 Osorio's players, at least, appreciate his hard-won expertise. ''I call him, in a way, like a genius because they live in a completely different world than ourselves,'' said Javier Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez, the Mexican star known as Chicharito, or Little Pea. ''Even if you can speak five minutes with him about one game or one player, he gives you the way he sees football and the way he sees that player, and it's knowledge that you can learn if you want.''\par \par \uc2 (Osorio stood by the players after photos and videos leaked of a party several of them attended with escorts hours after the team beat Scotland, 1-0, in its final appearance in Mexico before heading to the Cup.)\par \par \uc2 After the Chile defeat, with a traumatized nation baying for his firing, Osorio went on something of an intellectual and emotional journey, consuming books about failure and humility, while seeking out other coaches who had endured devastating losses. He had his players study a video of Chile's goals, and hired a mental coach from Spain to help them recover and prepare for this World Cup.\par \par \uc2 Now, Osorio will finally have the chance to erase the loss from his and Mexico's collective memory and maybe even break the nation's World Cup curse.\par \par \uc2 ''If he can get through to the fifth game, all will be forgiven,'' said H\u233\'00\'E9rculez G\u243\'00\'F3mez, a Mexican-American broadcaster for \uc2 ESPN\uc2  who played professionally in the United States and Mexico. ''That's what they've long yearned for.''\par \par \uc2 The image of Juan Carlos Osorio, the coach of the Mexican national team, loomed over the Rose Bowl after a 0-0 draw against Wales last month.; A fan displaying his allegiance before the Rose Bowl match against Wales.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LONDON -- Renford McIntyre was just a child when he left Jamaica to join his parents in Britain.\par \par \uc2 He spent the next 50 years here, working various jobs and paying taxes. Like tens of thousands of people from families encouraged to come from British colonies in the Caribbean to help rebuild postwar Britain, he had always assumed that he was a full-fledged British citizen.\par \par \uc2 Until, that is, the government decided he wasn't. At the age of 60, he was declared an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He lost his job. He could no longer apply for benefits. He became homeless.\par \par \uc2 ''I've lost out on everything,'' said Mr. McIntyre, who is now 64.\par \par \uc2 The issue has simmered in Britain since \uc2 Theresa May\uc2  was home secretary and set out to create a ''really hostile environment'' for illegal immigrants, imposing tough new requirements in 2012 for people to prove their legal status. But that was not easy for thousands of people like Mr. McIntyre, many of whom did not have British documents and whose parents came to Britain before the Caribbean colonies gained independence.\par \par \uc2 Just this month, as leaders of former British colonies gathered in London for a Commonwealth meeting, Mrs. May, now prime minister, found herself forced to apologize for the harsh treatment many Caribbean immigrants were experiencing and pledged to grant citizenship to all those caught up in the bureaucratic tangle.\par \par \uc2 ''We are genuinely sorry,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Friction within the Commonwealth was not what Mrs. May needed. Britain is already at odds with its neighbors as its leaders struggle through the difficult negotiations over leaving the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Great strides have been made to improve race relations in Britain. The engagement last year of Prince Harry, the sixth in line to the throne, to \uc2 Meghan Markle\uc2 , a biracial American actress, was seen by many as a watershed.\par \par \uc2 But Britons of Caribbean descent say the immigration fiasco reveals far more than bureaucratic fumbling, exposing a willful ignorance of Britain's colonial past and its rich black history, which goes back many centuries.\par \par \uc2 Sharon Baptiste, a researcher, said Britain had never truly faced the realities of its black history. ''On the one hand,'' she said, ''you've got the empire, and on the other, you've got the consequences of the empire'' -- immigration -- ''but most British don't seem to make the link between the two.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McIntyre's parents were among thousands of colonial subjects invited to come to Britain to help rebuild a nation shattered by World War II. They were part of the ''Windrush Generation,'' named for a passenger liner that carried many of them to Britain. Because Jamaica had yet to gain independence when his parents switched islands, their passports said ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McIntyre's descent after the British changed the rules was quick.\par \par \uc2 When he applied for housing aid, officials refused him, even though he provided school records and reams of tax returns showing he had lived and worked in Britain all his adult life.\par \par \uc2 ''They said I'm not a British subject,'' he said. ''I was confused. They put me through a rough time. Ever since, I rely on alcohol to numb the pain.''\par \par \uc2 Thousands of people who came to Britain between 1948 and 1971 from the Caribbean are thought to be in the same predicament as Mr. McIntyre. Estimates of the number of people affected vary from 50,000 to 500,000.\par \par \uc2 Some have been detained. At least one man was denied cancer treatment because he could not prove to his doctors that he was in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Prime Minister May at first tried to place the blame on the Labour Party, but she was forced to back down in the face of evidence that the groundwork for the scandal was laid during the years that she was the home secretary, the cabinet minister responsible for overseeing immigration.\par \par \uc2 The Labour Party, in the person most prominently of \uc2 David Lammy\uc2 , a black member of Parliament whose parents were Windrush-era migrants, has accused Mrs. May of presiding over racist policies and has demanded that her home secretary, \uc2 Amber Rudd\uc2 , resign.\par \par \uc2 Beyond pledging to grant citizenship to all those caught up in the migration crackdown and to waive the fees and tests usually involved in that process, the \uc2 Home Office\uc2  has established a special team to expedite applications.\par \par \uc2 But the scandal has had a particularly distasteful resonance for black Britons, who say it is a symptom of lingering racism within government institutions.\par \par \uc2 Under the rules imposed when Mrs. May was home secretary, people were required to prove their identity and legal status in the country in order to get a job, rent an apartment, receive free medical care, open a bank account or enroll in school, among other things.\par \par \uc2 That created an immediate problem for Windrush-era migrants like Mr. McIntyre, who struggled to prove their status. They had been unaware that they had to apply for the necessary documentation; theoretically, they have indefinite permission to remain under a 1971 law.\par \par \uc2 Their plight surfaced now and then in the news, but came to prominence after a series of reports in \uc2 The Guardian\uc2 . The \uc2 Home Office\uc2 , the newspaper reported, had not kept a record of those granted permission to remain or issued any paperwork confirming it. Then, in 2010, it even destroyed the landing cards recording migrants' arrivals from the Caribbean.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McIntyre questioned the motive behind the destruction of landing cards. ''Why did they do that?'' he asked. ''To me, it seems like they want to get rid of us.''\par \par \uc2 It has seemed that way to many in a generation of workers who accepted an invitation to come to Britain. They pitched in as construction and railway workers, nurses, bus and truck drivers, among other, mostly blue-collar pursuits, never suspecting that their status as British citizens or legal residents would be challenged.\par \par \uc2 Many black Britons say institutionalized racism of the kind endured by the Windrush migrants remains deeply ingrained and rarely publicized.\par \par \uc2 Danesha Forte, 37, whose parents were Windrush migrants from Barbados, could not hide her exasperation.\par \par \uc2 ''It's atrocious,'' Ms. Forte said, as she stood in Windrush Square in Brixton, the heart of London's West Indian community. ''Why are they targeting us? Are they trying to create a riot?'' The neighborhood was the scene of major riots in 1981 and again in 1985, as young black men clashed with a police force they believed was persecuting their community.\par \par \uc2 ''Black people are always targeted for something,'' Ms. Forte said, adding that the police still disproportionately stopped and searched black people, particularly the young. ''It's one thing after the other. We just can't catch a break.''\par \par \uc2 Britain, Ms. Baptiste said, remains enamored with romantic visions of its imperial past, a sentiment that in part drove its decision to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . ''We are an empire,'' she said, ''but for some people here, there are still too many dark faces.''\par \par \uc2 Most Britons are not taught about the prominent roles blacks played at royal courts in 15th-century Tudor Britain. Nor is it widely known that millions of ordinary Britons, even humble shopkeepers, owned shares in the slave trade. And across Britain, heritage plaques on Georgian townhouses euphemistically describe former slave traders and slave owners as West Indies merchants or planters.\par \par \uc2 A rose-tinted narrative of the British Empire was also peddled to its colonial subjects. Barbadians, for example, had been taught to revere the ''mother country,'' a mythical land populated by gentlemen, said Peter Fryer, author of ''Staying Power: The History of Black People in Britain.''\par \par \uc2 Before moving to Britain for work, ''They took their British citizenship seriously, and many regarded themselves not as strangers but as kinds of gentlemen,'' he wrote. ''Everything taught in school encouraged this belief. What they found here dismayed and shocked them.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lammy, the Labour lawmaker, who last year forced \uc2 Oxford University\uc2  to reveal data showing that in 2015 a third of its colleges had failed to admit a single black British high school graduate, expressed outrage at the way the government had treated a generation of workers who contributed a great deal to the country.\par \par \uc2 ''These are descendants of former enslaved people, colonized by the state, who served in two world wars, who were invited to work in Britain, and who are now effectively expelled from the country,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Rudd, the home secretary, apologized last week for the treatment of the Windrush migrants, calling it ''appalling'' and ''wrong.''\par \par \uc2 But immigration lawyers said the apology was too little, too late. Officials were warned of the precarious status of Windrush migrants several years ago, when the immigration rules were tightened, they said, and had done nothing.\par \par \uc2 The treatment of Windrush-era migrants in recent years is reminiscent of how they were treated when they first arrived in the country, said Danny Keen, who came to Britain from Jamaica on his mother's passport in 1952.\par \par \uc2 ''It's reinvoking those early racial prejudices that we experienced in the 1950s, when people could stop you in the street and say, 'Why don't you go back to your country?''' he said.\par \par \uc2 As late as the 1960s, Mr. Keen said, notices were displayed saying, ''No Irish, no dogs, no blacks.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Keen, 70, a portrait artist who organizes Black History Month in Norfolk, said his mother could not take out a mortgage to buy property because of her skin color. His schoolteachers regarded him as mentally inferior to his white classmates, he said.\par \par \uc2 When the engagement of Ms. Markle and Prince Harry was announced five months ago, he said, ''we thought maybe we've got no more work to do.''\par \par \uc2 But then the Windrush scandal broke.\par \par \uc2 ''So I say, the work still needs to be done,'' he said. ''We've got to keep kicking down the door.''\par \par \uc2 Renford McIntyre, 64, lost his home and his job in Britain after working there all of his adult life.

PETERS \par \uc2 1,620 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 April 2018\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Scott Lloyd's unadorned job title betrays little hint of the power he has over the pregnant teenagers in his custody.\par \par \uc2 As director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, he oversees the assistance program for the tens of thousands of refugees who still seek shelter in the United States, even with the Trump administration's crackdown. But as the government official who is also responsible for the care of young, undocumented immigrants who enter the United States without their parents, he spends much of his time trying to stop those who want an abortion.\par \par \uc2 He has instructed his staff to give him a spreadsheet each week that tells him about any unaccompanied minors who have asked for one and how far along they are in their pregnancy. In at least one case he directed staff to read to one girl a description of what happens during an abortion. And when there's a need for counseling, Mr. Lloyd's office calls on someone from its list of preferred ''life affirming'' pregnancy resource centers.\par \par \uc2 Last fall Mr. Lloyd's refusal to let a 17-year-old in Texas leave the shelter where she was living to get an abortion drew an admonishment from a federal judge who said she was ''astounded'' the government had been so insistent on keeping someone from obtaining a constitutionally protected procedure. Last week another judge barred him from trying to prevent any girl in his care from getting an abortion, but government lawyers have asked for a stay and plan to appeal.\par \par \uc2 How Mr. Lloyd, an appointee of President Trump, turned a small office in the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  that provides social services to refugees into a battleground over abortion rights is part of the larger story of the Trump administration's push to enact rules that favor socially conservative positions on issues like abortion, contraception and gay, lesbian and transgender rights.\par \par \uc2 Unlike some traditional Republicans, many religious conservatives eagerly sought jobs in the administration and the chance to shape policy after eight years of a Democratic president. This was especially true at H.H.S., where the senior ranks are staffed with former activists who have built careers advancing socially conservative causes.\par \par \uc2 Some of those hires at H.H.S. include a deputy general counsel who was a lawyer with the \uc2 Alliance Defending Freedom\uc2 , a well-funded conservative legal group that opposes gay rights and abortion and fought the Obama administration's contraception coverage requirements; the chief of staff to the assistant secretary for health, who used to lead an abstinence advocacy group; and the head of the department's \uc2 Office for Civil Rights\uc2 , whose work at \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2  involved promoting religious freedom initiatives.\par \par \uc2 After a relatively slow start as key personnel were put in place, the department has been responsible for a flurry of new policies. It has told states that they no longer have to follow Obama-era rules that made it difficult to withhold Medicaid funding from \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 . It has announced the creation of an entity inside its \uc2 Office for Civil Rights\uc2  called the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division, which will respond to alleged violations of conscience and religious protections. And its new strategic plan commits the department to ''protecting Americans at every stage of life, from conception.''\par \par \uc2 The result, activists on both sides of the fight say, is that no White House has been as aggressive in shaping policy in a way that hews so closely to the priorities of the religious right.\par \par \uc2 ''Times are changing,'' said Roger Severino, the head of the \uc2 Office for Civil Rights\uc2 , as he announced the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division this year. ''And we are institutionalizing a change in the culture of government, beginning with H.H.S.''\par \par \uc2 Unlike previous Republican administrations, when it was Congress or the Supreme Court that initiated the biggest changes to abortion law, many of the most significant developments today are occurring at the agency level, largely out of public view. And that troubles liberal advocates like \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 , which has sued Mr. Lloyd and won several times.\par \par \uc2 ''There's much more action at the federal level under Trump than there has been with other administrations,'' said Jennifer Dalven, the director of the A.C.L.U.'s Reproductive Freedom Project.\par \par \uc2 And when that action occurs mostly under the radar, she added, ''you don't provoke the same level of outrage from the public. It's quiet. People don't see it. And unlike if you were to overturn Roe v. Wade, you don't have people marching in the streets.''\par \par \uc2 Since the week he took office, Mr. Trump has issued several orders that have thrown up roadblocks to access to abortion and reproductive health care.\par \par \uc2 Just three days after his inauguration, he reinstated a policy first implemented by President \uc2 Ronald Reagan\uc2  in 1984 that prohibits foreign nongovernmental organizations from performing or discussing abortions as a family planning option if they want to receive American funding.\par \par \uc2 While this decision was something Presidents George H.W. Bush and \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  also implemented, the Trump administration went further and expanded its order to say that if these nongovernmental organizations did offer or suggest abortion as an option, they would be ineligible not just for family planning assistance but for funding for a host of other unrelated health concerns -- like HIV awareness, malaria and nutrition. That put billions of dollars of American aid in jeopardy.\par \par \uc2 ''Trump being Trump, he didn't just reinstate,'' said Ilyse Hogue, the president of Naral Pro-Choice America. ''He applied it to a much larger pot of money.''\par \par \uc2 But the administration's most sweeping changes yet could come with proposed rules it announced in January. The proposals would expand protections for doctors, nurses and possibly a much wider pool of workers more loosely connected to health services who say that assisting with procedures like abortion and gender reassignment surgery would violate their religious beliefs. The administration is reviewing more than 55,000 comments on the proposals and could issue final rules later this year.\par \par \uc2 Critics say the language is so broad it could apply to virtually anyone, no matter how tangentially connected to the health care procedure or service they consider immoral.\par \par \uc2 ''If you are the contractor who empties the waste baskets at a health plan and that health plan covers abortion, you can refuse without being fired,'' said Clare Coleman, the president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association.\par \par \uc2 Like his colleagues in other parts of H.H.S., Mr. Lloyd, who declined requests for comment, has a history in the anti-abortion movement. Before he joined the Trump administration, he worked as a policy coordinator for the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic fraternal order, and served on the board of a crisis pregnancy center in Virginia. On the r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 and cover letter he submitted to the department, he listed his work experience as the ''architect'' of a late-term abortion ban that is now law in six states.\par \par \uc2 While anti-abortion work has been his passion, Mr. Lloyd's job as director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement entails broad responsibilities for helping people of all ages who are trying to resettle in the United States with financial, medical and other assistance. That undocumented minors have been caught up in his personal quest to fight abortion is something of a bureaucratic quirk. Minors are under the care of his office; the placement of adult refugees is overseen by the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Administration for Children and Families\uc2  at H.H.S., which oversees the \uc2 Office of Refugee Resettlement\uc2 , said in a statement that as the legal guardian for the minors, Mr. Lloyd's office is required by law to act with the girls' interests in mind. And the Trump administration has determined, the statement added, that ''the best interests of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children in our care include the protection of mothers and their babies in our facilities, and we will defend human dignity for all in our care.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lloyd has taken the position that as unauthorized immigrants, the girls are not entitled to the same constitutional protections as citizens. Under questioning from an A.C.L.U. lawyer during a deposition, he said he did not know of any set of circumstances that would cause him to grant an abortion request, though he said that if a girl's life were in danger that could ''potentially'' sway him. He has denied at least one request for an abortion from a girl who said she had been raped.\par \par \uc2 Anti-abortion groups have welcomed his defiance as a hopeful sign. And they echo what H.H.S. officials have said themselves: A new culture is taking hold inside the Trump administration.\par \par \uc2 ''If you think this is just an appendectomy, you rush that person to the hospital,'' said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List. ''But if you think that an abortion is actually taking another person's life, you pause, you think, you consider and figure out other options. And I think that's where the Trump administration is coming from.''\par \par \uc2 A rally in October supporting a 17-year-old in Texas who had sought an abortion while in immigration custody.

ARCHIBOLD \par \uc2 1,308 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 February 2018\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PYEONGCHANG, South Korea -- They are united here, at the Winter Games, at the bottom ranks of a sport considered among the most dangerous and daring, flopping belly first on a heavy sled and rocketing headfirst down a twisting and swirling ice track at 80 miles an hour.\par \par \uc2 It's called skeleton, not because of what may break, but because of the bony appearance of the sled (or from a corruption of a Norwegian word for sled, ''kjaelke''). Some call it plain crazy.\par \par \uc2 The two skeleton athletes here from Jamaica and Ghana, two countries where there is very little natural ice, if any, were apprehensive, too, at first, neither of them knowing much about the sport before giving it a shot.\par \par \uc2 Anthony Watson, 28, a sometime actor from New Jersey representing Jamaica through his father's lineage, recalled lying on the sled a few years ago as a training coach lifted his legs before that first run down, way down.\par \par \uc2 ''He didn't tell me anything,'' he recalled. ''He was just like, 'All right, see you at the bottom,' and he just shoved me on the track.''\par \par \uc2 Akwasi Frimpong, 32, a once promising track athlete in the Netherlands who immigrated there illegally from Ghana as a child and represents that country, remembers thinking on that first run: ''Oh, man, I'm going to die. You want to brake, but there are no brakes. If there was a button to press stop, I would have.''\par \par \uc2 But then he got to the bottom nearly a minute later, alive, and recovered his athletic instincts.\par \par \uc2 ''The competitiveness in you says why not go back up and make less mistakes and go even faster,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Now, here they are, improbably, proudly, at the Olympics.\par \par \uc2 They met in October 2016 at a training camp for what are called emerging countries in the sport. They became fast friends, sharing a quick laugh, skin darker than their competitors', the bond of representing ancestral countries where they did not live and a determination to get to the Olympics in an unfamiliar sport.\par \par \uc2 They have trained together. They have lost together. They have prayed together.\par \par \uc2 They share a storage and preparation shed for their sleds here and also the bond of minor celebrity. They also get the same question a lot: What are you doing here?\par \par \uc2 To which they say: This is the Olympics. What is everybody else doing here? Dreaming big, testing their limits and, in some cases, sending a message.\par \par \uc2 ''I want to break barriers, to show that people from warmer countries, black people, can do this sport as well,'' Frimpong said. ''I want to write the history for my country, and hope more kids come out of their comfort zone. And I want to gain experience for the next Olympics in 2022.''\par \par \uc2 They finish each other's sentences and have their own rituals, a handshake and chest bump of solidarity, before and after races, as a way to ground themselves in a sport in which the color of their skin makes them stand out and sometimes invites skepticism.\par \par \uc2 ''Before every run we dap up, and at the bottom we dap up, and at the end of the day we dap,'' Watson said.\par \par \uc2 There are nearly 3,000 athletes here from 92 countries. Most of them will go home empty-handed, as Watson and Frimpong surely will. They were at the very bottom of the standings before the final runs on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Yet they demand to be taken seriously as athletes, juggling news media attention while trying to focus and train.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want to be just a media guy,'' said Frimpong, who, like Watson, competed in the sport's world championships last year. ''I want to show I can slide as well.''\par \par \uc2 His journey was particularly circuitous.\par \par \uc2 He left Ghana at age 8, carried to the Netherlands by his mother, who had left five years before to work cleaning houses and selling flowers to provide for her 11 children living in a cramped house in Ghana. She had promised to send for him, but he landed in an alien European world where organized sports helped him earn acceptance.\par \par \uc2 He excelled at track, gaining notice as a Dutch junior national champion at 17 in 2004, and eventually earning a scholarship to a university in Utah. But his status as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  initially kept him from leaving the Netherlands, until a public campaign helped smooth over the paperwork.\par \par \uc2 He came close to making the 2012 Olympic track team for the Netherlands, but an injury kept him off and sidelined his track career. He was steered to bobsled and nearly made the 2014 Sochi Games team for the Netherlands.\par \par \uc2 A coach suggested skeleton. It was 2015, and he was selling vacuum cleaners in Arizona, where he had moved with his wife. He knew not giving it a shot to make the Olympics again would gnaw at him.\par \par \uc2 ''It was like a bucket list thing,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 He chose Ghana, he said, because he felt he had given to two countries by then, the Netherlands and the United States, where he was engaged in charitable endeavors related to track.\par \par \uc2 ''At the age of 31, you ask, what have you done for your country?''\par \par \uc2 Ghana was more than willing to have him, though he is getting by mostly on sponsorships. His racing helmet, showing a rabbit escaping the jaws of a lion, represents his breaking free from life's challenges.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, Watson struggled to make the Olympics in track, and ended up in skeleton as a last-ditch effort. He had scrolled through the qualifications for nearly every sport and found that skeleton offered walk-ons who passed physical tests a path.\par \par \uc2 He went to a combine for the sport in Lake Placid, N.Y., and did well enough to earn a spot in an elite camp. Gradually, however, he accepted that it would be highly competitive to make the American team.\par \par \uc2 Jamaica, with its ''Cool Runnings'' vibe and history of recruiting promising athletes for bobsled and skeleton, opened the way.\par \par \uc2 He had paid the bills by working in the family furniture business and acting, even turning down a temporary spot as a hyena in ''The Lion King'' on Broadway so he could train for the Olympics.\par \par \uc2 They both know skeptics and doubters remain. They read it on the faces of some athletes, but try to keep focus.\par \par \uc2 ''This is bigger than ourselves,'' Watson said, as Frimpong nodded hard in agreement. ''Which is why we connect so well, because you see a lot of athletes and the reason they are so depressed and on themselves and lashing out at other people is because this is literally all they have.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SITTWE, Myanmar -- He was a member of the Rohingya student union in college, taught at a public high school and even won a parliamentary seat in Myanmar's thwarted elections in 1990.\par \par \uc2 But according to the government of Myanmar, U Kyaw Min's fellow Rohingya do not exist.\par \par \uc2 A long-persecuted Muslim minority concentrated in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine, the Rohingya have been deemed dangerous interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh. Today, they are mostly stateless, their very identity denied by the Buddhist-majority Myanmar state.\par \par \uc2 ''There is no such thing as Rohingya,'' said U Kyaw San Hla, an officer in Rakhine's state security ministry. ''It is fake news.''\par \par \uc2 Such denials bewilder Mr. Kyaw Min. He has lived in Myanmar all of his 72 years, and the history of the Rohingya as a distinct ethnic group in Myanmar stretches back for generations before.\par \par \uc2 Now, human rights watchdogs warn that much of the evidence of the Rohingya's history in Myanmar is in danger of being eradicated by a military campaign the United States has declared to be ethnic cleansing.\par \par \uc2 Since late August, more than 620,000 Rohingya Muslims, about two-thirds of the population that lived in Myanmar in 2016, have fled to Bangladesh, driven out by the military's systematic campaign of massacre, rape and arson in Rakhine.\par \par \uc2 In a report released in October, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said that Myanmar's security forces had worked to ''effectively erase all signs of memorable landmarks in the geography of the Rohingya landscape and memory in such a way that a return to their lands would yield nothing but a desolate and unrecognizable terrain.''\par \par \uc2 ''The Rohingya are finished in our country,'' said Mr. Kyaw Min, who lives in Yangon, the commercial capital of Myanmar. ''Soon we will all be dead or gone.''\par \par \uc2 The United Nations report also said that the crackdown in Rakhine had ''targeted teachers, the cultural and religious leadership, and other people of influence in the Rohingya community in an effort to diminish Rohingya history, culture and knowledge.''\par \par \uc2 ''We are people with our own history and traditions,'' said U Kyaw Hla Aung, a Rohingya lawyer and former political prisoner, whose father served as a court clerk in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine.\par \par \uc2 ''How can they pretend we are nothing?'' he asked.\par \par \uc2 Speaking over the phone, Mr. Kyaw Hla Aung, who has been jailed repeatedly for his activism and is now interned in a Sittwe camp, said his family did not have enough food because officials have prevented full distribution of international aid.\par \par \uc2 Myanmar's sudden amnesia about the Rohingya is as bold as it is systematic. Five years ago, Sittwe, nestled in an estuary in the Bay of Bengal, was a mixed city, divided between an ethnic Rakhine Buddhist majority and the Rohingya Muslim minority.\par \par \uc2 Walking Sittwe's crowded bazaar in 2009, I saw Rohingya fishermen selling seafood to Rakhine women. Rohingya professionals practiced law and medicine. The main street in town was dominated by the Jama mosque, an Arabesque confection built in the mid-19th century. The imam spoke proudly of Sittwe's multicultural heritage.\par \par \uc2 But since sectarian riots in 2012, which resulted in a disproportionate number of Rohingya casualties, the city has been mostly cleared of Muslims. Across central Rakhine, about 120,000 Rohingya, even those who had citizenship, have been interned in camps, stripped of their livelihoods and prevented from accessing proper schools or health care.\par \par \uc2 They cannot leave the ghettos without official authorization. In July, a Rohingya man who was allowed out for a court appearance in Sittwe was lynched by an ethnic Rakhine mob.\par \par \uc2 The Jama mosque now stands disused and moldering, behind barbed wire. Its 89-year-old imam is interned.\par \par \uc2 ''We have no rights as human beings,'' he said, asking not to use his name because of safety concerns. ''This is state-run ethnic cleansing and nothing else.''\par \par \uc2 Sittwe's psyche has adapted to the new circumstances. In the bazaar recently, every Rakhine resident I talked to claimed, falsely, that no Muslims had ever owned shops there.\par \par \uc2 Sittwe University, which used to enroll hundreds of Muslim students, now only teaches around 30 Rohingya, all of whom are in a distance-learning program.\par \par \uc2 ''We don't have restrictions on any religion,'' said U Shwe Khaing Kyaw, the university's registrar, ''but they just don't come.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kyaw Min used to teach in Sittwe, where most of his students were Rakhine Buddhists. Now, he said, even Buddhist acquaintances in Yangon are embarrassed to talk with him.\par \par \uc2 ''They want the conversation to end quickly because they don't want to think about who I am or where I came from,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In 1990, Mr. Kyaw Min won a seat in \uc2 Parliament\uc2  as part of a Rohingya party aligned with the National League for Democracy, Myanmar's current governing party. But the country's military junta ignored the electoral results nationwide. Mr. Kyaw Min ended up in prison.\par \par \uc2 Rohingya Muslims have lived in Rakhine for generations, their Bengali dialect and South Asian features often distinguishing them from Rakhine Buddhists.\par \par \uc2 During the colonial era, the British encouraged South Asian rice farmers, merchants and civil servants to migrate to what was then known as Burma.\par \par \uc2 Some of these new arrivals mixed with the Rohingya, then known more commonly as Arakanese Indians or Arakanese Muslims. Others spread out across Burma. By the 1930s, South Asians, both Muslim and Hindu, comprised the largest population in Yangon.\par \par \uc2 The demographic shift left some Buddhists feeling besieged. During the xenophobic leadership of Gen. Ne Win, who ushered in nearly half a century of military rule, hundreds of thousands of South Asians fled Burma for India.\par \par \uc2 Rakhine, on Burma's western fringe, was where Islam and Buddhism collided most violently, especially after World War II, during which the Rakhine supported the Axis and Rohingya the Allies.\par \par \uc2 Later attempts by a Rohingya insurgent group to exit Burma and attach northern Rakhine to East Pakistan, as Bangladesh was then known, further strained relations.\par \par \uc2 By the 1980s, the military junta had stripped most Rohingya of citizenship. Brutal security offensives drove waves of Rohingya to flee the country.\par \par \uc2 Today, far more Rohingya live outside of Myanmar -- mostly in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia -- than remain in what they consider their homeland.\par \par \uc2 Yet in the early decades of Burma's independence, a Rohingya elite thrived. Rangoon University, the country's top institution, had enough Rohingya students to form their own union. One of the cabinets of U Nu, the country's first post-independence leader, included a health minister who identified himself as Arakanese Muslim.\par \par \uc2 Even under Ne Win, the general, Burmese national radio aired broadcasts in the Rohingya language. Rohingya, women among them, were represented in \uc2 Parliament\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 U Shwe Maung, a Rohingya from Buthidaung Township in northern Rakhine, served in \uc2 Parliament\uc2  between 2011 and 2015, as a member of the military's proxy Union Solidarity and Development Party. In the 2015 elections, however, he was barred from running.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya were disenfranchised in those polls.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shwe Maung's electoral district, which had been 90 percent Rohingya, is now represented by a Rakhine Buddhist.\par \par \uc2 In September, a local police officer filed a counterterrorism suit accusing Mr. Shwe Maung of instigating violence through \uc2 Facebook\uc2  posts that called for an end to the security offensive in Rakhine. (The military operation began after Rohingya militants besieged government security posts in late August.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shwe Maung, the son of a police officer himself, is in exile in the United States and denies the charges.\par \par \uc2 ''They want every Rohingya to be considered a terrorist or an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ,'' he said. ''We are much more than that.''\par \par \uc2 Clockwise from top: Rohingya refugees from Myanmar crossing the Naf River into Bangladesh, where over 620,000 have fled to since August; U Kyaw Min, a former teacher who once won a seat in Parliament, at his party's office in Yangon; a Rohingya home burned by the military in Rakhine State.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc16}{\*\bkmkend toc16}\b \uc2 California Resolute in Sanctuary Status as a Heated Case Ends\b0\par\par\uc2 By JENNIFER MEDINA \par \uc2 1,076 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 December 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES -- When Kathryn Steinle was killed in July 2015 while strolling with her father on a San Francisco pier, Donald J. Trump's campaign was just two weeks old.\par \par \uc2 For the next 16 months, he seized on the killing as an example of the problems with illegal immigration and sanctuary cities. The man who fired the gun, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, was an undocumented immigrant who had been deported several times and had recently been freed by the San Francisco County sheriff.\par \par \uc2 Even amid the drumbeat of outrage from Mr. Trump and other Republicans over Ms. Steinle's death -- and now, Mr. Garcia Zarate's acquittal on Thursday of murder -- San Francisco and the rest of California have not taken a harder line against undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Instead, they have effectively doubled down on policies protecting them.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco has successfully sued the Trump administration to stop it from financially punishing sanctuary cities, which limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers. Both California and San Francisco, along with other cities, have set aside money to help pay for lawyers for undocumented immigrants facing deportation.\par \par \uc2 And in October, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed a law strictly limiting communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers, effectively turning all of California into a sanctuary state.\par \par \uc2 ''California's local law enforcement cannot be commandeered and used by the Trump Administration to tear families apart, undermine our safety, and wreak havoc on our economy,'' Kevin de Le\u243\'00\'F3n, the Democratic leader of the State Senate, said in a statement when Mr. Brown signed the law, calling it ''a wall of justice against President Trump's xenophobic, racist and ignorant immigration policies.''\par \par \uc2 But while the fight over immigration has become symbolic of California's role as a leader of the Democratic opposition to the president, the only fiery remarks over the last two days have come from Mr. Trump and other Republicans, a sign of the delicate position for leaders here in the face of the death of an American citizen.\par \par \uc2 After the acquittal, Mr. Trump called again for the construction of a border wall and threatened to use Ms. Steinle's death against Democrats, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions again criticized sanctuary cities for ''having put the public's safety at risk.''\par \par \uc2 The reaction in California was far more muted. ''San Francisco is and will always be a sanctuary city,'' a spokesman for Edwin M. Lee, the city's mayor, said in a statement, declining further comment.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of sanctuary policies say they build trust with immigrant communities and ultimately stop crime, and have argued that Ms. Steinle's death was an aberration that was unfairly turned into political fodder. They say the policies also protect undocumented immigrants who are otherwise law-abiding, but opponents counter that such immigrants should not be immune from deportation.\par \par \uc2 ''There is nothing more repugnant than the racist exploitation of tragedy and I think that people of California have a heightened sensitivity when that happens,'' said \uc2 Chris Newman\uc2 , legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which pushed for the statewide legislation.\par \par \uc2 In a poll this year by the \uc2 Public Policy Institute of California\uc2 , respondents were split when asked if they supported the new state law -- 48 percent said they were in favor, compared with 42 percent who said they were opposed. Some of the support, said Mike Madrid, a Republican consultant based in Sacramento, may have had as much to do with feelings about Mr. Trump than about support for undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ''This has become more than an immigration and economic issue, it's become a cultural issue,'' Mr. Madrid said. ''This happened in California, the place that has become the beating heart and center of the resistance. Everyone is going to get out their shovel and dig deeper.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Steinle's parents -- who, unlike other relatives of victims killed by undocumented immigrants, never appeared alongside Mr. Trump during the campaign -- personify the difficulty of fitting the killing into the immigration debate. They have said that they support the concept of sanctuary cities, but that San Francisco officials made a mistake in releasing Mr. Garcia Zarate.\par \par \uc2 The family was not in the courtroom when the verdict was read on Thursday, but told The San Francisco Chronicle they were ''shocked and saddened.''\par \par \uc2 At the time of the shooting, Mr. Garcia Zarate had a criminal record that included seven felony convictions, and he had been deported from the United States five times. He spent almost four years in a federal prison for illegally re-entering the country, then was sent to jail in San Francisco because of a warrant for a 20-year-old felony marijuana charge, which a local court dismissed almost immediately.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials said they issued a request to be notified when he would be released from jail, noting that they had an order for deportation. But the sheriff who runs the jail said that the city's sanctuary ordinance meant that he could only respond to immigration authorities if they had a formal court order, which are rare with immigration charges. Mr. Garcia Zarate was released, and later that year, fired the gun that killed Ms. Steinle.\par \par \uc2 During the trial, lawyers for both sides reminded jurors that they were there to decide a criminal case, not debate immigration issues. Defense attorneys argued that Mr. Garcia Zarate had found the gun on the pier and fired it accidentally, which created enough reasonable doubt in juror's minds against prosecutors' claims that he had intentionally killed Ms. Steinle. Mr. Garcia was acquitted of murder, manslaughter, and assault with a firearm, and was convicted only of being a felon in possession of a firearm.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, federal officials moved to avoid a repeat of Mr. Garcia Zarate's release. They secured an arrest warrant accusing him of violating his supervised release from prison, which will allow them to take custody of him for possible prosecution and deportation.\par \par \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate; A photo of Kathryn Steinle near the spot in San Francisco where she was fatally shot by Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a criminal record.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc17}{\*\bkmkend toc17}\b \uc2 In Case Invoked by Trump, Mexican Man Is Acquitted in Killing\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT STEVENS, THOMAS FULLER and CAITLIN DICKERSON \par \uc2 1,043 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 December 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 An undocumented Mexican immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges on Thursday in the killing of Kathryn Steinle, whose death while out walking on a San Francisco pier became a touchstone in the national debate over immigration fueled by Donald J. Trump.\par \par \uc2 The man, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 45, who was also found not guilty of assault with a firearm, was convicted only of being a felon in possession of a firearm after a trial that lasted more than five weeks. His sentence could range from 16 months to three years. Mr. Zarate has already spent more than two years in county jail awaiting trial. A sentencing date had not yet been set.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Steinle's death in July 2015 fed into a fierce debate over whether immigrants without legal status -- Mr. Garcia Zarate had been deported five times -- should be dealt with more aggressively, and over the role local law enforcement should play.\par \par \uc2 ''For anyone that would question the outcome in this case, this jury was deliberating for six days,'' Jeff Adachi, the San Francisco public defender, said after the verdict. ''There was a tremendous amount of misinformation that was spread about this case from Day 1. You had then-candidate Trump espousing that this was an intentional shooting.''\par \par \uc2 In a telephone interview, Alex Bastian, an assistant district attorney in the office of the San Francisco district attorney, George Gasc\u243\'00\'F3n, said the verdict ''was not the one we had hoped for.''\par \par \uc2 ''Both the prosecution and defense worked very hard in litigating this case,'' he said. ''At the end of the day, however, it is up to the jury to determine what they believe is an appropriate verdict. They came back the way they did and we will respect the jury's decision.''\par \par \uc2 After the verdict was read, the victim's father, Jim Steinle, told The San Francisco Chronicle, ''We're just shocked -- saddened and shocked.''\par \par \uc2 ''There's no other way you can coin it,'' he said. ''Justice was rendered, but it was not served.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump invoked Ms. Steinle's killing as he campaigned for president and tried to rally national support for his hard-line immigration agenda, which ultimately helped to catapult him into office.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday night, Mr. Trump wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : ''A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.''\par \par \uc2 In a statement, a \uc2 United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  official said that after the conclusion of the case, the agency would ''work to take custody of Mr. Garcia Zarate and ultimately remove him from the country.''\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a longtime hard-liner on immigration enforcement who has threatened to strip federal funds from cities like San Francisco because of sanctuary policies, responded to the verdict in a statement.\par \par \uc2 ''San Francisco's decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle,'' he said. ''The Department of Justice will continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens. I urge the leaders of the nation's communities to reflect on the outcome of this case and consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement officers.''\par \par \uc2 Jurors declined to speak to the media, a court spokeswoman told The Chronicle.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Steinle, known as Kate, a 32-year-old medical equipment saleswoman, was walking along Pier 14 in San Francisco when she was struck by a bullet and collapsed into her father's arms. Mr. Garcia Zarate acknowledged firing the weapon, but said it was an accident.\par \par \uc2 Evidence was presented in court that the bullet had ricocheted before striking Ms. Steinle.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garcia Zarate had been homeless at the time of the shooting and had multiple felony convictions. He had been set free from jail only months before the shooting, in defiance of requests by federal immigration authorities, who had asked that he be held longer so he could be deported again.\par \par \uc2 The backlash to his release crescendoed when Mr. Trump cited the case during the campaign.\par \par \uc2 In a major speech on immigration in August 2016, Mr. Trump argued that ''countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump then named several young people who he said had become victims of policies he considered failures. Among those he named was Ms. Steinle, who Mr. Trump said had been ''gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , deported five previous times.''\par \par \uc2 ''And they knew he was no good,'' Mr. Trump said of the man who had shot her.\par \par \uc2 Unlike some other families whose personal tragedies have become political talking points, Ms. Steinle's parents have largely avoided the news media. But, at times, they have acknowledged the utility to politicians of their experience.\par \par \uc2 ''For \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , we were just what he needed -- beautiful girl, San Francisco, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , arrested a million times, a violent crime and yadda, yadda, yadda,'' her mother, Liz Sullivan, told The Chronicle. ''We were the perfect storm for that man.''\par \par \uc2 In June, the House approved a bill known as Kate's Law that would stiffen penalties for immigrants caught illegally re-entering the country after being deported. It was received in the Senate about two weeks later, where it has apparently stalled.\par \par \uc2 After the verdict, the lead defense lawyer in the case said Mr. Garcia Zarate's immigration status was not relevant to the crime, an argument he said he had posed during jury selection.\par \par \uc2 ''I think it brought home the idea that, 'Hey, you know what, if he committed murder, prove it,''' the lawyer, Matt Gonzalez, said in an interview. ''But you can't just convict him because he's not from the United States.''\par \par \uc2 Still, conservative commentators, including Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter, quickly condemned the verdict.\par \par \uc2 ''Jury convinced that illegal alien killed Kate Steinle accidentally,'' Ms. Coulter wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . ''She would still be alive if we had a wall.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020171201edc10006h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

But they are fiercely blaming each other for allowing them to happen.\par \par \uc2 The case has stirred up a tempest because the man accused of crawling through the bedroom window of a 65-year-old woman, tying her up and raping her is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Sergio Jose Martinez, who has been deported to Mexico 20 times and has been arrested 10 times this year.\par \par \uc2 Under political fire for releasing Mr. Martinez after his most recent stint in jail, the sheriff declared that President Trump's immigration agency was at fault for failing to provide a legal basis for holding him longer, while the White House blamed the sheriff for letting him go.\par \par \uc2 Cases like that of Mr. Martinez around the country are inciting outrage, amplified by an administration that is eager to expel undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In a recent speech in Miami that made national headlines, Attorney General Jeff Sessions described the case and several others like it in graphic detail, and said that releasing potentially deportable immigrants like Mr. Martinez when their jail terms were over does ''far broader damage to the country than many understand.''\par \par \uc2 ''At its root,'' he added, ''it is a rejection of our immigration laws.''\par \par \uc2 The political jockeying is rooted in a vexing constitutional disconnect between criminal justice and immigration enforcement, which is a matter of civil, not criminal, law. Questions about the legality of trying to connect the two may become one of the most significant legal challenges to the Trump administration's immigration policy, experts say.\par \par \uc2 The way the administration sees it, the nation's jails have the potential to become a powerful pipeline for deportation. But jailed immigrants must serve their sentences first, before they can be detained by the immigration authorities -- and as a practical matter, it is often impossible for immigration agents to be present and ready at the jail the moment the immigrants are released, which may happen on short notice, late at night or on a weekend.\par \par \uc2 The immigration agency has tried to solve that problem by requesting that the local police keep holding inmates like Mr. Martinez for days after their sentences end, to allow time for agents to pick them up. In a series of decisions, federal judges have declared the practice unconstitutional -- but the Trump administration has continued to demand compliance anyway.\par \par \uc2 Since he took office, the president and his attorney general have mounted an unbridled political assault against local officials who refuse to honor the requests, which are known as detainers. At the same time, though, cities and states across the country have adopted policies that bar local officials from doing so. The situation has local sheriffs and police chiefs in a bind: Whom should they obey, the president or the courts?\par \par \uc2 ''Until the Supreme Court speaks on this, you will continue to see a division in the country,'' said \uc2 Muzaffar Chishti\uc2 , the director of the Migration Policy Institute at the New York University School of Law.\par \par \uc2 Making matters worse, both sides of the argument have tended to mischaracterize the underlying legal issues in order to score political points.\par \par \uc2 In his frequent public scoldings of local officials, Mr. Sessions routinely ignores the constitutional issues that the detainer requests raise. Judges have said that holding people in criminal custody for a civil infraction violates the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable seizures, and the administration's demands violate the 10th Amendment by forcing states to do the federal government's bidding.\par \par \uc2 The Multnomah County sheriff, \uc2 Mike Reese\uc2 , whose jurisdiction includes Portland, has responded to criticism over the Martinez case with another problematic argument, one that has been frequently advanced by officials under fire from the administration.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Sheriff Reese said he could not have held Mr. Martinez after his sentence ended because immigration officials had not produced a valid criminal warrant. ''Instead, they processed a civil detainer, which they know cannot be legally used in Oregon,'' Sheriff Reese wrote.\par \par \uc2 Under federal law, though, immigration officials have no standing to obtain a warrant in the criminal courts.\par \par \uc2 While the legal issues remain unresolved, cases like that of Mr. Martinez continue to pile up, and to be trumpeted by the administration with unrelenting pressure.\par \par \uc2 Nery Israel Estrada Margos, who had previously been deported to Guatemala, turned himself in to the police in Santa Rosa, Calif., for killing his girlfriend about two weeks after he was released on bail awaiting trial for battery.\par \par \uc2 The local sheriff in Santa Rosa told enraged residents that he was legally bound to release Mr. Estrada after he posted bail. But a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, James Schwab, faulted the sheriff, saying that his policy concerning detainers had ''clearly failed in this case, as it has in too many others.''\par \par \uc2 ''Not only does the policy undermine ICE's ability to carry out its mission, but it needlessly puts our communities at risk,'' Mr. Schwab said.\par \par \uc2 Advocacy groups for immigrants are campaigning to strengthen the legal firewall between jails and immigration enforcement with legislation to restrict extended jail holds or ban them altogether. At least four state legislatures and many more cities and counties have considered enacting such laws this year.\par \par \uc2 The advocates say that when the local police cooperate too closely with the immigration agency, undocumented immigrants avoid coming forward to report crimes or act as witnesses.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not about those individuals,'' \uc2 Thomas A. Saenz\uc2 , president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said of defendants like Mr. Martinez and Mr. Estrada. ''It's about the message that's sent to the community.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Saenz and others say that while the extreme cases capture public attention, most of the people for whom the immigration agency issues detainers were arrested for low-level offenses like driving without a license -- charges that they say hardly justify throwing aside the Bill of Rights.\par \par \uc2 For many sheriffs, though, the worst stories can be too jarring, both ethically and politically, to ignore. Most sheriffs are elected, and the cases often prompt indignant letter-writing campaigns and explosive town-hall-style meetings, with constituents on both sides of the debate demanding answers.\par \par \uc2 ''They're mortified,'' Jonathan F. Thompson, executive director of the \uc2 National Sheriffs' Association\uc2 , said of his group's members. ''They know that the people they are trying to keep off the street, they are unable to.''\par \par \uc2 More than a dozen people who were held on detainers have brought lawsuits against local governments, and the vast majority of those suits have been successful, resulting in settlement payments as high as $145,000. Even so, some sheriffs honor detainer requests despite the risk of litigation.\par \par \uc2 ''When they take a chance and they hold them, it can boomerang and be very damaging,'' Mr. Thompson said.\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration has turned up its use of detainers, issuing about 11,000 a month, or nearly 80 percent more than last year, and is playing a more active role in defending their use.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sessions made his recent speech on the issue in Miami-Dade County, which is currently being sued for honoring a detainer, and held the county up as a positive example for other local governments. The Justice Department has filed legal briefs supporting the county, and has asked to present oral arguments in court.\par \par \uc2 In addition to the administration's public criticism of local officials who do not comply with detainers, Mr. Trump has threatened to withhold federal grant money from jurisdictions that refuse to comply with them.\par \par \uc2 State governments have split on the issue. Texas recently enacted a law that requires local law enforcement officials to comply with detainers, or face a $25,000-a-day fine and removal from office. (It has not yet taken effect because of litigation in federal court.) In Illinois, on the other hand, the governor has promised to sign a bill that would severely restrict extended jail holds, and in California, which already limits them, there is legislation pending to restrict them further.\par \par \uc2 Sheriffs from across the political spectrum have called on the federal government to settle the issue definitively, which would probably require an overhaul of the country's immigration laws, an unlikely undertaking in the current political climate. In the meantime, local governments are left with administrative moves by the executive branch that have widely been perceived as cosmetic and ineffectual.\par \par \uc2 For example, in April, the immigration agency changed its standard form for detainers to remove the word ''voluntary'' from the top. It also announced that each request would be accompanied by an administrative warrant, a type not reviewed by a judge. Experts say neither step would appear to make any legal difference.\par \par \uc2 A meeting this spring between Mr. Sessions and several sheriffs offered one reason the Trump administration may seem so far out of sync with local authorities on the issue. According to one sheriff who was there -- Richard Stanek of Hennepin County, Minn. -- when the federal court decisions from the last three years concerning extended jail holds came up in discussion, Mr. Sessions appeared to be unfamiliar with them.\par \par \uc2 ''He was still living in 2014,'' Mr. Stanek said. ''He had no idea what we were talking about.''\par \par \uc2 Follow Caitlin Dickerson on Twitter @itscaitlinhd.\par \par \uc2 Thomas A. Saenz says detainers are mostly sought for low-level offenders.

Reporting was contributed by Staci Semrad in San Antonio, Vivian Yee in Atlanta and Nicholas Kulish and Liz Robbins in New York. \par \uc2 1,500 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 August 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON -- This has been a harrowing year for the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who have put down stakes in Houston.\par \par \uc2 Stepped-up enforcement of immigration measures put many on edge over deportations, while Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed one of the nation's most punitive laws against cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. President Trump has amplified his harsh line on illegal immigration and renewed his promise to build a border wall.\par \par \uc2 Then came the chaos of Hurricane Harvey.\par \par \uc2 Families among Houston's estimated 600,000 undocumented immigrants -- the largest number of any city in the United States except New York and Los Angeles, according to the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  -- fled their homes to escape the flooding despite their anxiety over being turned away at shelters or facing hostile immigration agents.\par \par \uc2 ''People were telling each other that the immigration men were coming to check our papers,'' said Eloy Gonz\u225\'00\'E1lez, 40, a truck driver who made it to the sprawling shelter at the George R. Brown Convention Center. All he had were the drenched clothes he was wearing when he escaped the flooding in Pasadena, a suburb of Houston where thousands of immigrants live in the shadow of oil refineries.\par \par \uc2 ''The rumors are false but the fear is still there,'' said Mr. Gonz\u225\'00\'E1lez, an immigrant from northern Mexico, emphasizing that he was one of the ''lucky ones'' who is legally in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Even as political leaders in Houston sought to reassure residents that routine immigration enforcement would not be conducted at shelters and food banks, many people fleeing their homes expressed dismay over what they described as mixed signals coming from immigration authorities in the upheaval around Hurricane Harvey.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol did not suspend operations at checkpoints in Texas on Saturday even after the storm unleashed destruction in parts of the state, drawing sharp rebukes from human rights activists who said the decision put the lives of undocumented immigrants and mixed-status families at risk.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  said that maintaining the checkpoints stood in contrast to the position taken just last October by the Border Patrol during Hurricane Matthew, when authorities explicitly said that there would be no immigration enforcement checkpoints.\par \par \uc2 Officials with the Border Patrol sought to ease fears, contending that the checkpoints in Texas are set up south of areas affected by the storm, but rights groups pointed out that many people in Houston could potentially pass through the checkpoints to reunite with family members or seek refuge in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Public statements from some immigration authorities added to the sense of confusion and unease. In a joint statement Tuesday, the Border Patrol and \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , or ICE, said that routine enforcement would not be conducted at evacuation sites, shelters or food banks.\par \par \uc2 But in the same statement the organizations said, ''The laws will not be suspended, and we will be vigilant against any effort by criminals to exploit disruptions caused by the storm.''\par \par \uc2 As many immigrants coped with the flooding of their homes, a sense of dread over state and federal immigration policies hung over shelters here in Houston and other parts of the state where people are hunkering down as rain continues to fall.\par \par \uc2 Houston, which emerged as one of the nation's most diverse cities after receiving a huge influx of immigrants and refugees from around the world in recent decades, exemplifies the undercurrents of opportunity and distress. Vietnamese and Indian entrepreneurs dominate certain corridors, where they run restaurants and shops. The city is home to the largest Afghan refugee population in the United States.\par \par \uc2 But the biggest group hails from Latin America, and many of them are undocumented immigrants who crossed the border to fill jobs in restaurants, hotels and construction.\par \par \uc2 Houston has been the destination for thousands of Central Americans fleeing gang violence and poverty since 2014, advocates say. Typically, mothers who arrive with children are fitted with ankle monitors that track their movement while they wait for their asylum case to be adjudicated. The monitors, which are clunky, must be charged every 12 hours or so. Even in normal conditions, they cause rashes and cuts.\par \par \uc2 ''Most of our clients have ankle monitors, and we don't know how these devices will withstand being underwater,'' said Miriam Camero, a caseworker in Houston for RAICES, an immigrant legal-aid group based in San Antonio.\par \par \uc2 Sowing confusion and fear among some people here, more than two dozen Border Patrol agents from a special operations detachment in South Texas arrived in Houston with a dozen vessels to help with the emergency relief effort. But Manuel Padilla Jr., a chief patrol agent with the agency, found it necessary to go on the local \uc2 Univision\uc2  news in Houston to reassure people in Spanish that the agents were here to save the lives of people endangered by the storm, not to check their documents.\par \par \uc2 For many undocumented immigrants, the sight of Border Patrol boats on their flooded streets was enough to frighten them. ''Just physically and visually seeing the Border Patrol out there caused panic,'' said Cesar Espinosa, executive director of FIEL Houston, an immigrant rights organization. ''They thought they were coming to get them.''\par \par \uc2 Houston's mayor, \uc2 Sylvester Turner\uc2 , a Democrat, sought to ease some of the anxiety, reflecting Houston's reputation as a frequently progressive, immigrant-friendly city. But Mr. Turner also stepped into the fray over a bill passed by the State Legislature in May, known as Senate Bill 4, scheduled to go into effect on Friday unless a federal judge enjoins it after several localities challenged it in court.\par \par \uc2 The law would ban police chiefs, sheriffs and other law-enforcement officials from stopping an officer from questioning an individual about his or her immigration status. It would also mandate that jail administrators honor all requests from ICE to hold an immigrant who is deportable for the agency to pick up.\par \par \uc2 In a news conference on Monday, Mr. Turner called for putting the ''law on the shelf'' while the city focuses on rescuing victims of the storm.\par \par \uc2 Still, organizations that assist immigrants expressed an array of concerns over S.B. 4, considered the harshest anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  law since Arizona passed a tough bill years ago that was watered down by the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 ''The S.B. 4 issue is very real in our community, and although S.B. 4 does not require any local official to check immigration status it certainly has created a climate of fear,'' said Geoffrey Hoffman, director of the immigration clinic at the University of Houston Law Center.\par \par \uc2 ''I think the recent words of the mayor may have ameliorated some of our concerns,'' he added, ''but again people do not know how or if things will change after September 1, given the statewide effective date.''\par \par \uc2 A lack of trust among immigrants has deepened since President Trump was inaugurated in January and immigration arrests, particularly of those without criminal records, ramped up.\par \par \uc2 ''The history is ICE says one thing and does another,'' said Barbie Hurtado, a community organizer for RAICES, the San Antonio legal services group. ''The fear is out there. People don't want to come out and say who they are and seek help.''\par \par \uc2 Adding to the fear, Ms. Hurtado said, are reports that Mr. Trump is weighing ending an Obama administration program that has granted permission to stay and work to about 800,000 immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children.\par \par \uc2 For some of the families sleeping on cots in Houston's convention center, the signals coming from Washington, and the state capital, Austin, were clear, and alarming.\par \par \uc2 ''All we want to do is work hard and raise a family,'' said Jorge, a 43-year-old employee of a Houston catering company. Declining to give his last name, he explained that he had to seek shelter with his wife and three daughters after their home was flooded. When he was asked about his immigration status, he simply looked at the floor and said that he and his wife moved to Houston years ago from Guanajuato in central Mexico.\par \par \uc2 ''This is where we are right now, at the mercy of the elements,'' he said. ''We were already so scared. It would be a disgrace if they come after us now.''\par \par \uc2 A boy was lowered to a boat Tuesday in northeast Houston. Officials have rescued about 7,000 people since the storm began. (PHOTOGRAPH BY BARBARA DAVIDSON FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A1); An evacuation staging area.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The families could reel off all the times they had called the media and written to Washington, but after all that trying, they had never heard anyone who mattered say anything like it: Most Mexican immigrants, \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  declared in his first campaign speech, were ''rapists'' who were ''bringing drugs, bringing crime'' across the border.\par \par \uc2 Now he had come to meet them, the families of people killed by undocumented immigrants, and they wanted to tell him he was right.\par \par \uc2 One son had been struck by a truck, another shot just around the corner from home. Different causes of death, but the driver, the gunman, all the perpetrators were the same, the parents said: people who never should have been in the country in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Sitting alone with them at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in July 2015, the candidate distributed hugs as the families wept. When the campaign had called, most of them had been told only that they were going to meet with Mr. Trump. But then the group was ushered into the next room, where the campaign had invited reporters to a news conference.\par \par \uc2 It was a surprise, but no one seemed to mind. Several stepped up to endorse Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 ''He's speaking for the dead,'' said Jamiel Shaw Sr., whose teenage son was shot to death by a gang member in Los Angeles in 2008. ''He's speaking for my son.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shaw wanted the news media to know that Mr. Trump could have gone further when he called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals.\par \par \uc2 ''I would have said they were murderers,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Hailed for bravery, accused of racism, scorned as puppets, these are some of Mr. Trump's most potent surrogates, the people whose private anguish has formed the emotional cornerstone of his crusade against illegal immigration and clouded the futures of America's 11 million unauthorized immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Their alliance came down to this: To parents parched for understanding, Mr. Trump was a gulp of hope. The Trump campaign flew them to speak at rallies and at the Republican National Convention, put them up in Trump hotels and kept in touch with regular phone calls and messages. After his victory, Mr. Trump invited at least one to the Inaugural Ball and seated three more with the first lady during his first address to Congress.\par \par \uc2 Then and since, they have defended him on social media and in the press, assuring the world that, with President Trump in office, their children will not have died in vain.\par \par \uc2 I'm proud and full of respect for a President who cares about our safety! Let's Make America Safe Again! -- Mary Ann Mendoza (@mamendoza480) February 3, 2017\par \par \uc2 Trump Publishes 1st List of 'Sanctuary Cities' Protecting Illegal Aliens {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/7k8opzBNFv"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/7k8opzBNFv}}}\uc2  via @BreitbartNews #jamielslaw -- Jamiel Shaw Sr. (@real_jamielshaw) March 24, 2017\par \par \uc2 This week, the House of Representatives plans to vote on a bill that would intensify penalties for immigrants who re-enter the United States after being deported. The bill is named for a woman fatally shot by a man who illegally crossed the border at least five times.\par \par \uc2 Sabine Durden, the mother of another victim, recalls dropping to her knees and sobbing when she first heard Mr. Trump warn of the dangers of illegal immigration. Then his campaign called.\par \par \uc2 ''It was almost an out-of-body experience after being so deeply hurt and nobody listening and nobody wanting to talk to you about this,'' she said. ''It's almost like I put on a little Superwoman cape because I knew I was fighting a worthwhile fight.''\par \par \uc2 In Washington in April, they sat in the front rows as Mr. Trump's homeland security secretary unveiled an office for victims of crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants: of the many promises the new president had made in their names, one of the first kept.\par \par \uc2 To Mr. Trump's critics, the office and the people it was supposed to represent were little more than pawns in his crude attempts to make monsters out of a largely law-abiding population -- one that research has shown to commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans. But here before the cameras, the secretary, John F. Kelly, was putting his hand over his heart and thanking families.\par \par \uc2 ''To say the least, my heart goes out to you,'' Mr. Kelly told them. That night, they celebrated what felt like their achievement over dinner and drinks at the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. It was expensive, they admitted, but it felt right. It was strange that one of the sweetest moments of their lives was about reliving the single bitterest. But there had been a lot of that over the past year or two, as they searched for a way to make it all mean something: the startled and painful pride of finding themselves booked on national television and welcomed to the White House to talk about the blight of illegal immigration, all because of their sons and daughters, who were gone.\par \par \uc2 An Overnight Awakening\par \par \uc2 The local news reports said Dominic Durden's motorcycle was hit by a pickup truck as he rode down Pigeon Pass Road in Moreno Valley, Calif., on his way to his job as a 911 dispatcher. He was 30. They identified the other driver as Juan Zacarias Tzun, who was charged with vehicular manslaughter. It was July 12, 2012. Sabine Durden had last seen her son at the airport the day before, when he dropped her off for a trip to Atlanta. Across the country, she said, she nearly blacked out at the moment of his death. Later, after her phone lit up with messages from his friends, she was sure she knew why.\par \par \uc2 Not until later, she said, did she find out from some of her son's friends in law enforcement that Mr. Tzun had come to the country illegally from Guatemala, and that he had been convicted twice of driving under the influence. He had been released on bail several weeks before the collision.\par \par \uc2 At his sentencing in 2013, Mr. Tzun blamed God for the crash. Ms. Durden blamed the immigration system.\par \par \uc2 ''If it was an accident, I could deal with it, but this wasn't an accident, because if that guy wasn't in the country at 5:45 on July 12, 2012, my son would still be alive,'' she said. (Mr. Tzun was deported in 2014.)\par \par \uc2 But nobody overseeing her son's case seemed willing to view his death that way, she said. ''You feel like you got the runaround,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Durden, 59, had come to the United States from Germany when she married an American in the Army, eventually becoming a citizen. He was a Democrat, so she was a Democrat. She had never thought much about the immigration debate before Dominic died. Now it was her whole life.\par \par \uc2 Then came Mr. Trump. Whenever she saw him, he greeted her with a ''great big hug,'' she recalled. ''Dom's mom,'' he called her.\par \par \uc2 ''He would say, 'You'll never be alone again. You'll never have to fight this alone,''' said Ms. Durden, who went on to speak at three of his rallies.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Sabine Durden on undocumented immigrants: "Build the wall!" Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 The Democratic nominee, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , was out there talking about the need to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. When Ms. Durden heard that, she changed her voter registration to Republican the same day.\par \par \uc2 In a series of recent interviews, the families described a similar trajectory: The death of a loved one. The spasm of realizing that the other driver, or the gunman, was living in the country illegally. The political awakening -- for the Republicans, a hardening toward illegal immigrants; for the Democrats, a quick, grim conversion. The relief, when another ''angel mom'' or ''angel dad'' saw them on the news and found them online.\par \par \uc2 Most of all, the fear that their children would diminish into fading news and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  tributes, horror stories circulated in the outer boroughs of the American right -- until Mr. Trump thundered into their lives, bearing cameras.\par \par \uc2 Immigration was ''one of those issues that, it didn't affect me -- I was busy working,'' said Steve Ronnebeck, 50, whose 21-year-old son, Grant, was shot and killed as he worked overnight at a convenience store in Mesa, Ariz., in January 2015.\par \par \uc2 ''As time went on and the more angry I got, that's when I got more active,'' he said. ''This is how I deal with my grief.''\par \par \uc2 For another parent who came to the Beverly Hills meeting, Don Rosenberg, a self-described lifelong liberal from Westlake Village, Calif., it was hard to embrace Mr. Trump, even if he had the right idea about immigration.\par \par \uc2 As he watched Mr. Trump announce his presidential bid on TV, ''I'm saying to myself, he's talking about illegal immigration -- why did it have to be Trump?'' said Mr. Rosenberg, 64, whose 25-year-old son died in a motorcycle accident in 2010. He had been struck by a Honduran man in the country illegally. ''To me, an immigration policy isn't, 'Build a wall, Mexico will pay for it.'''\par \par \uc2 Still, by the election, Mr. Rosenberg had come around. He said that he had not voted for either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump, knowing it was not likely to make a difference in California, but that if he had lived in a swing state, he would probably have cast his ballot for Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 V.I.P. Treatment\par \par \uc2 Here was the paradox of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , the unfiltered tycoon who seemed as far away as Fifth Avenue and as close up as the living room TV. Even as a legion of critics warned he was pandering to his fans on the way to betraying them, the alliance he had made with the families felt, to many of them, like an unshakable bond.\par \par \uc2 The thing was, he paid attention. And he never stopped.\par \par \uc2 After the Beverly Hills meeting, Mr. Shaw received a gift basket containing Mr. Trump's ''Art of the Deal,'' chocolates, and Trump-branded ties and cuff links, according to an account in The Wall Street Journal. At one point, Mr. Shaw flew on Mr. Trump's private plane. At another, while staying at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, he cut a campaign commercial.\par \par \uc2 The other families received regular care from the campaign, too. A Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, would call or text at least once a month, inviting them to speak at rallies or just checking in. Some spoke regularly to \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , Mr. Trump's campaign manager at the time, or to Hope Hicks, the campaign's spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Miller, an advocate of restricting immigration and now a senior White House adviser, helped draft Mr. Trump's Jan. 25 executive order directing the government to intensify immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 A few of the parents also regularly texted with Keith Schiller, Mr. Trump's longtime bodyguard and current Oval Office aide. It was Mr. Schiller whom the president sent to hand-deliver a letter to \uc2 James B. Comey\uc2  informing him he was no longer director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\par \par \uc2 To find some of the families, Mr. Trump's team had help from the Remembrance Project, a nonprofit founded in 2009 to draw attention to the victims of crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants. It caught the Trump wave early, bringing several families to the Beverly Hills meeting and other campaign events and hosting a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump in Houston last fall.\par \par \uc2 As the campaign offered a national audience to more of the parents, however, many of the Remembrance Project's members abandoned the group, chafing at what several said were its founder's attempts to dictate what they said and even what they wore. Mr. Trump, they said, had allowed them their own voice.\par \par \uc2 Before going onstage at some events, Mr. Trump would shoo aides away for a private moment with the families.\par \par \uc2 ''To me, I find it much more personal when the president comes up to you and says, 'Steve, how are you doing?''' Mr. Ronnebeck said. ''He knows my name. He doesn't just, you know, speak the whole time. He listens.''\par \par \uc2 For the Trump campaign, the private cultivation paid off. In public, the families became some of the campaign's most compelling witnesses.\par \par \uc2 They could be picked out by what they carried, the talismans of absence: the T-shirts printed with photographs of the smiling dead. The commemorative buttons. The ashes held close in a locket.\par \par \uc2 At one rally in Phoenix in August, a hush muted the crowd when Mr. Ronnebeck and other family members approached the microphone, one by one, to speak about a lost son or daughter.\par \par \uc2 ''I truly believe that Mr. Trump is going to change things,'' Mr. Ronnebeck said, his voice catching.\par \par \uc2 At the Republican National Convention, Mr. Shaw, Ms. Durden and another parent took turns speaking about their children. Mr. Trump's acceptance speech was partly devoted to the story of Sarah Root, 21, who was killed in Nebraska the day after graduating from college by a Honduran immigrant who was driving drunk.\par \par \uc2 ''I've met Sarah's beautiful family,'' the nominee said. ''But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting.''\par \par \uc2 [Video: 07/21/16 \uc2 RNC\uc2  The Story of Sarah Root Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 He also mentioned the case that, at least on the right, had come to define the dangers of illegal immigration: that of Kathryn Steinle, a 32-year-old woman shot to death on a San Francisco pier in 2015. The suspect was an ex-felon from Mexico who had been deported five times. A few months before Ms. Steinle's death, the local authorities had released him from jail without notifying federal immigration agents.\par \par \uc2 ''My opponent wants sanctuary cities,'' Mr. Trump said, referring to local governments, including San Francisco, that limit their cooperation with immigration officials. ''But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?''\par \par \uc2 The president has since vowed to starve such cities of federal funding, but a judge has temporarily blocked his administration from doing so. The House is scheduled to vote this week on a bill, known as Kate's Law, that would stiffen penalties for immigrants caught illegally re-entering the country after being deported.\par \par \uc2 For all the heat the Steinle case generated, however, her family kept a distance from the campaign, occasionally breaking their silence to voice discomfort with the way her death had become a political grenade. (Through their lawyer, they declined to comment.)\par \par \uc2 ''For \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , we were just what he needed -- beautiful girl, San Francisco, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , arrested a million times, a violent crime and yada, yada, yada,'' Liz Sullivan, Ms. Steinle's mother, told The San Francisco Chronicle in September 2015.\par \par \uc2 'We've Chosen to Speak.'\par \par \uc2 Politics makes public playthings of private lives. As their losses came to eclipse everything else about them, the families became, in Mr. Trump's telling, living testimonials to all that was broken about the immigration system.\par \par \uc2 Still, those who appeared on the campaign's behalf said they had never felt like props. Mr. Trump was no more using them, they said, than Mrs. Clinton was using hardworking Hispanic families to humanize the issue.\par \par \uc2 ''He's never once asked us to speak,'' said Michelle Root, 48, Sarah Root's mother. ''We've chosen to speak.''\par \par \uc2 It looked very different to the other side, of course. People on social media, and even some friends, did not hesitate to let them know that they thought they were being used. Lots of people called them racist. They insisted that they were not, emphasizing that they did not think all undocumented immigrants were bad.\par \par \uc2 A large body of research, accumulated over many years, has found that immigrants are less likely than native-born citizens to commit serious crimes or to be imprisoned.\par \par \uc2 For the families, such studies were beside the point. To them, illegal immigration was an epidemic of preventable deaths.\par \par \uc2 The glare of other people's judgment did get to them sometimes. Mr. Ronnebeck took a break from social media for six weeks, as the anniversary of Grant's death passed, then the inauguration, then Grant's birthday.\par \par \uc2 ''There's people that think I'm a racist and there's people out there that think I'm the devil,'' he said. ''It gets to a point where you just can't do the negative anymore.''\par \par \uc2 Not for long, though. With Mr. Trump in the White House, they could take their message straight to the corridors of power. Some hope the president will revoke Obama-era protections for young undocumented immigrants; others pray to see the wall built.\par \par \uc2 ''I think we could email or text or even pick up the phone, for some of them, and call them and have them pass it on,'' Ms. Root said of her contacts in the White House. ''And he would listen. He might not agree, and might not do it, but I know our voice would be heard.''\par \par \uc2 Sabine Durden, above at right, whose son died when he was struck by a pickup truck driven by an undocumented immigrant.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Interrupting Gang Killings\par \par \uc2 In Metropolitan last Sunday, Ginia Bellafante wrote about the use of immigration enforcement to go after gangs like MS-13. Readers responded at nytimes.com, and their comments have been edited for length and clarity.\par \par \uc2 Effective or ineffective at reducing violence -- who cares? \uc2 Illegal-immigrant\uc2  gang members need to be rounded up, prosecuted for racketeering and other crimes, imprisoned for as long as possible in federal prison, and then when old men, released and deported. Money well spent. That goes for any violent criminals, particularly those which belong to gangs. In terms of the 33,000 gun-violence deaths cited by the writer, no mention is made of the fact that one-third are murders and two-thirds suicides. The writer seeks to minimize the 40 or so murders attributed to MS-13 by juxtaposing them against the number of gun deaths referenced. Really, as if 40 murders were the equivalent of littering?\par \par \uc2 Duane Coyle, Wichita, Kan.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, the task is enormous thanks to decades of lax enforcement. We get what we tolerate and allowing the brutality of MS-13 to exist, let alone thrive, in this country under the auspices of ''compassion'' and ''people seeking a better life'' is intolerable.\par \par \uc2 CNNNNC, Connecticut\par \par \uc2 Democrats and sanctuary cities will defend these gang members from deportation with taxpayer dollars.\par \par \uc2 M. Seattle\par \par \uc2 When I read this article, I see someone trying to put some perspective on what is taking place with immigrant gangs, the total numbers of gang murders and ways that some have tackled gang violence. However, many of the commenters seem to think that adding any background to a story that does not encourage a Trump policy is against President Trump and just a slanted hit piece. Hopefully someday people can read different sides to an issue without an us-vs.-them mentality.\par \par \uc2 BS99, New Jersey\par \par \uc2 This is all very interesting, but Mr. Trump's time, as well as any federal agency that is law enforcement, needs to be concentrated on all these opioids that half the country is addicted to. That's what they need to do, get whatever gang is selling all these pills and heroin in their community. You will not have time to do anything else, I can assure you of that. The deaths associated with opioids has surpassed gun deaths anyway.\par \par \uc2 Marie Belton, Ormond Beach, Fla.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY LUCY NICHOLSON/REUTERS) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170528ed5s0005s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Jessica Colotl embodied the debate over illegal immigration when she was locked up for 37 days and nearly sent back to Mexico after an Atlanta-area police officer caught her driving without a license in 2010.\par \par \uc2 To supporters, including her sorority sisters, the president of her college and the immigrant advocates who publicized her case, hers was an example of police overreach and the need to safeguard ambitious young students from deportation. To others, she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , plain and simple, who also was abusing the system by attending a public college at discounted tuition.\par \par \uc2 She returned to college -- paying full price, because of a new Georgia law inspired by her case -- completed her degree and qualified for a program started by President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2012, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which protects some undocumented youth from deportation.\par \par \uc2 ''Since then, I have been working and doing well for myself,'' Ms. Colotl, now 28, said in an interview this week. ''I thought that all the legal battles were behind me.''\par \par \uc2 That was until Ms. Colotl, who was brought to the United States by her parents as a child, learned Monday that her DACA status had been revoked, thrusting her into the national immigration debate anew.\par \par \uc2 With a new president in the White House, she is once again facing deportation.\par \par \uc2 Dustin Baxter, Ms. Colotl's lawyer, on Tuesday requested that a federal judge in Atlanta intervene and reinstate her DACA protection.\par \par \uc2 ''We are taking an innocent girl who has done nothing but contribute to the society she has been a part of since she was 11 and making her a villain and poster child for Trump's deportation policies,'' Mr. Baxter said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 About 750,000 immigrants have benefited from DACA, and even as he has promised to crack down on illegal immigration, President Trump has said repeatedly that he will not target DACA recipients, also known as Dreamers.\par \par \uc2 But since 2012, more than 1,500 Dreamers have had their DACA status revoked for criminal activity, according to \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 After her arrest for driving without a license, Ms. Colotl had been charged with providing a false address to a law enforcement officer, a felony. She admitted guilt and had the case dismissed after completing community service, a common outcome for low-level offenses. Though she was not convicted, under immigration law her admission to the crime was enough to initiate the loss of DACA status.\par \par \uc2 While the Obama administration allowed Ms. Colotl into the program in 2013 -- and allowed her to renew in 2015 -- the new administration appears less willing to overlook her record.\par \par \uc2 ''Jessica Colotl, an unlawfully present Mexican national, admitted guilt to a felony charge in August 2011 of making a false statement to law enforcement in Cobb County, Ga.,'' said an ICE statement. ''Ms. Colotl was subsequently allowed to enter a diversionary program by local authorities; however, under federal law her guilty plea is considered a felony conviction for immigration purposes.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Colotl's original case became emblematic of hot-button immigration questions, like whether young undocumented immigrants deserved a pass, whether they should benefit from in-state tuition and whether an enforcement program designed to identify violent criminals for removal was ensnaring other immigrants as well.\par \par \uc2 During her junior year at \uc2 Kennesaw State University\uc2 , on March 28, 2010, Ms. Colotl was pulled over for blocking traffic in a parking lot at the college.\par \par \uc2 She had no license, so within days she was transferred to federal immigration custody under a program known as 287(g), which lets local officials act as immigration-law enforcers and cooperate with deportation authorities.\par \par \uc2 She spent more than a month in an Alabama detention facility until being released, thanks to campaigning on her behalf. She became a symbol of the long and ultimately unsuccessful fight to pass the federal Dream Act, which would have legalized immigrants like Ms. Colotl who entered the United States as children, and which opponents criticized as an amnesty measure.\par \par \uc2 ''Jessica has a dream,'' read a sign at a rally held by Lambda Theta Alpha, the Latina sorority she had helped establish at the college. ''Support the Dream Act.''\par \par \uc2 Nine days after her release, the Cobb County sheriff, Neil Warren, pressed charges against Ms. Colotl, saying she had supplied a false address to a deputy who had booked her into jail, a felony.\par \par \uc2 ''Ms. Colotl knew that she was in the United States without authority to be here and voluntarily chose to operate a vehicle without a driver's license,'' Sheriff Warren said at the time, adding that she had ''further complicated her situation with her blatant disregard for Georgia law by giving false information.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Warren championed his county's participation in 287(g), a program that groups like \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  of Georgia derided for snagging a ''promising student'' like Ms. Colotl, rather than hardened criminals, and for promoting racial profiling. Nationally, an outcry against the program prompted the Obama administration to scale it back. Mr. Trump wants it used more often.\par \par \uc2 State legislators who became aware that Ms. Colotl was paying in-state tuition passed a law to make undocumented students pay out-of-state rates when attending public colleges. Some candidates for governor invoked Ms. Colotl in their calls for curbing illegal immigration in Georgia.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Colotl finished college and began working as a legal assistant at the law office of Charles Kuck, an Atlanta immigration attorney whose firm represents her now. (Her parents have since moved back to Mexico.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama began DACA, letting young undocumented immigrants like Ms. Colotl stay in the United States and work legally. But while the failed Dream Act could have eventually let Ms. Colotl become a permanent resident, DACA protection must be renewed every two years and can more easily be revoked.\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration so far has not used that power often. In the first three months of 2017, the government revoked DACA protections from 179 recipients for criminal activity and other reasons, a rate similar to that of the final year of the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Colotl, apparently, is not getting a pass.\par \par \uc2 She said that just last week she had donated platelets at a hospital to help people in need. Now, she said, she feels persona non grata, unable to work and threatened with ejection from the country.\par \par \uc2 ''I plan to continue fighting,'' she said. ''This has to be a mistake.''\par \par \uc2 Jessica Colotl became a symbol of the immigration debate after a 2010 traffic stop at her college.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ABC's anthology series ''American Crime'' returns for its third season with a new story starring Felicity Huffman, Timothy Hutton and Regina King. And the first three ''Jurassic Park'' films are ripe for binge-watching on \uc2 Netflix\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 What's on TV\par \par \uc2 AMERICAN CRIME 8 p.m. on ABC. This anthology series is back for its third season, and while the story and characters are new, expect to see some of the same actors -- including Felicity Huffman, Timothy Hutton and Regina King, who starred in Seasons 1 and 2. Story lines so far haven't shied away from topics like race, gender and class. This year, the plot is no different: An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico discovers that modern servitude is alive and well on farms and in agricultural communities.\par \par \uc2 RED DRAGON (2002) 5 p.m. on Sundance. This installment in the Hannibal Lecter franchise ''is a thriller too timid to thrill because it's the devil we not only know, but that audiences have come to love; it features the best known anthropophagite since Grendel stalked the world of Beowulf,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . ''Hannibal's ready for a musical by now, or at the very least a one-man show at the Helen Hayes Theater.''\par \par \uc2 60 MINUTES 7 p.m. on \uc2 CBS\uc2 . In ''Poisoned,'' Lesley Stahl reports on Vladimir Kara-Murza, the Russian political activist who says he was poisoned twice for publicly denouncing President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 . Ms. Stahl interviewed him from Washington, where Mr. Kara-Murza's family is living; still, he says he will return to Russia and continue to protest. And in ''Prisoner 760,'' Holly Williams travels to Mauritania to interview the former Guant\u225\'00\'E1namo Bay detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi, who was released in October and has written a book about his experiences at the military prison.\par \par \uc2 WICKED TUNA 9 p.m. on National Geographic Channel. Season 6 of this reality series opens with a race to land the first fish of the season -- which would mean big money for one captain. Then, at 10, ''Port Protection'' returns for its third season by showing what happens when equipment breaks down in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness. (Hint: Survival takes a bit of what the show calls ''backwoods ingenuity.'')\par \par \uc2 What's Streaming\par \par \uc2 JURASSIC PARK (1993) on \uc2 Netflix\uc2 . Steven Spielberg's sci-fi masterpiece earned a prescient review from \uc2 Janet Maslin\uc2  of The Times. She called it a ''true movie milestone'' for two reasons: ''the fierce, lifelike dinosaurs that stalk through the film with astounding ease'' and aspects ''that establish it as the overnight flagship of a brand-new entertainment empire.'' She added: ''Even while capturing the imagination of its audience, this film lays the groundwork for the theme-park rides, sequels and souvenirs that ensure the 'Jurassic Park' experience will live on.'' She was right: Three sequels followed, as did the toys and rides. Two of those subsequent films ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' (1997) and ''Jurassic Park III'' (2001) are also on \uc2 Netflix\uc2  for your binge-watching pleasure.\par \par \uc2 Regina King (PHOTOGRAPH BY NICOLE WILDER/ABC); Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2 .'' ''Unauthorized immigrant.'' ''Undocumented immigrant.'' ''Illegal alien.'' ''Migrant.'' ''Noncitizen.''\par \par \uc2 All of these terms, and some others, have been used in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  to describe a person who has entered, lived in or worked in the United States without proper authorization -- and each has been met with criticism.\par \par \uc2 In fact, an ambitious and comprehensive portrait of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States that was published in Tuesday's paper drew objections for both its use of ''illegal immigrants'' in the headline (which some saw as partisan and offensive) and its reference within the article to ''undocumented immigrants'' (which others saw as overly sympathetic).\par \par \uc2 In a debate as contentious as the one surrounding immigration policy in the United States, where even the most basic terminology is fraught with political implications, how do Times journalists decide, in a given instance, which term to employ?\par \par \uc2 Vivian Yee, a national immigration correspondent, grapples with the question on a regular basis -- and acknowledged that readers' reactions tend to break predictably along political lines. Conservatives, she said, often insist on using the term ''illegal immigrants,'' while liberals tend to push for ''undocumented immigrants.''\par \par \uc2 The article on Tuesday, which Ms. Yee helped to report, offered one example of how The Times attempts to navigate this linguistic quandary.\par \par \uc2 ''We decided that a story written with the intention of explaining the starting points of the immigration debate shouldn't take sides on the semantics of the debate,'' Ms. Yee said in an email, explaining that the article deliberately included a mix of different terms: ''illegal,'' ''undocumented,'' and ''unauthorized.''\par \par \uc2 ''And, of course,'' she added, ''we tried to show that there are real, live human faces to the issue by telling a few of their stories.''\par \par \uc2 The Times's style guide, a 368-page reference manual that offers guidance on everything from grammar and punctuation to particularly thorny issues of usage, acknowledges that the term ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' may be considered ''loaded or offensive'' by some readers. ''Without taking sides or resorting to euphemism,'' the guide states, ''consider alternatives when appropriate to explain the specific circumstances of the person in question or to focus on actions: who crossed the border illegally; who overstayed a visa; who is not authorized to work in this country.''\par \par \uc2 ''Unauthorized'' and ''undocumented'' are also listed as acceptable descriptions, though each is presented with caveats. ''Undocumented is the term preferred by many immigrants and their advocates, but it has a flavor of euphemism and should be used with caution outside quotation,'' the guide states. And ''unauthorized,'' it warns, has a ''bureaucratic tone.''\par \par \uc2 Off the table entirely are ''illegal,'' when used as a noun, and the sinister-sounding ''alien.''\par \par \uc2 Of course, employing the right language is only part of the difficulty of reporting on immigration: Finding individual immigrants who will agree to have their names and, in some cases, their photographs published in The Times can also prove particularly challenging.\par \par \uc2 ''It's extraordinarily more difficult now than it used to be,'' said Jennifer Medina, a correspondent who contributed reporting to Tuesday's article, when asked about her process for convincing immigrants, regardless of their legal status, to speak on the record about their experiences. ''People are much more fearful about repercussions, about outing themselves, about drawing any sort of attention to themselves. There's a pervasive sense of fear.''\par \par \uc2 That fear is largely a result of a sea change in immigration policy under the new administration. (Another result of President Trump's approach -- its effect on refugees from Central America who had applied, under the Obama administration, for sanctuary in the United States -- was explored in Thursday's front-page article filed from San Salvador.)\par \par \uc2 But the argument to convince vulnerable immigrants to share their stories is always the same, Ms. Medina said: ''By talking about what you're going through, you're giving voice to a group that otherwise might not be heard from.''\par \par \uc2 ''And,'' she added, ''if you don't talk about your experience, nobody is going to talk about it for you.''\par \par \uc2 Teresa Reyes, right, left Honduras last year to be with her husband, who lives in North Carolina.

PATEL \par \uc2 1,972 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 March 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 There are 11 million of them, the best estimates say, laboring in American fields, atop half-built towers and in restaurant kitchens, and in swelling American classrooms, detention centers and immigration courts. In the public's mind, the undocumented -- the people living here without permission from the American government -- are Hispanic, are mostly Mexican and crossed the southwestern border in secret. In the eyes of their advocates, they are families and workers, taking the jobs nobody else wants, staying out of trouble, here only to earn their way to better, safer lives for themselves and their children. At the White House, they are pariahs, criminals who menace American neighborhoods, take American jobs, sap American resources and exploit American generosity: They are people who should be, and will be, expelled. Illegal immigrants can be many of these things, and more. Eleven million allows for considerable range, crosshatched with contradictions.\par \par \uc2  There may be no more powerful symbol of how fixedly Americans associate illegal immigration with Mexico than the wall President Trump has proposed building along the southern border. But many of the unauthorized are not Mexican; almost a quarter are not even Hispanic. After Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, the largest number of unauthorized immigrants comes from China (an estimated 268,000). And China is one of 23 countries that do not cooperate with deportations. (The Trump administration has pledged to pressure all 23 into doing so.) They tend to be younger -- the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  has found that adult unauthorized immigrants were, at the median, about a decade younger than American-born adults -- and skew slightly more male than the rest of the country. Geography and demography are only two ways to categorize these 11 million. Circumstance offers another: As he seeks to tighten law enforcement's grip on unauthorized immigrants, Mr. Trump will grapple with a population of people who arrived in several ways and for myriad reasons, each slice presenting its own challenges.\par \par \uc2 TO HEAR MANY LIBERALS and immigrant advocates tell it, most undocumented immigrants are productive, law-abiding members of society, deeply rooted in communities, working hard, living quietly, paying taxes and raising families. Statistics show that many of the undocumented fit this profile. About 60 percent of the unauthorized population has been here for at least a decade, according to the nonpartisan \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 . A third of undocumented immigrants 15 and older live with at least one child who is a United States citizen by birth. Slightly more than 30 percent own homes. Only a tiny fraction have been convicted of felonies or serious misdemeanors. Of course, as the Trump administration has emphasized, merely being here without authorization is a violation of the law. Even the wording of the issue is revealing: Conservatives favor the term ''illegal immigrants,'' which hard-liners often truncate to ''illegals''; immigrant advocates prefer ''undocumented immigrants,'' a phrasing that they say prods the conversation back toward the humans in question, but that also has a whiff of euphemism. ''Unauthorized'' often shows up as a neutral alternative. No matter the label, people like Lydia, 47, who runs a small jewelry store in Los Angeles, do not think of themselves as lawbreakers. Lydia, who like several undocumented immigrants did not want her last name published for fear of being deported, crossed the border through Tijuana in 1988. She looked for legal help from a notary, mistakenly thinking that a ''notario'' indicates a legal expert, as it does in many Latin American countries. She was eventually ordered out of the country. But the Obama administration deprioritized deportations of people who had committed no major crimes, and it allowed her to live and work in the United States as long as she checked in with an immigration agent each year. Lydia raised four children, all citizens, and sent them to public schools in Sun Valley, a suburb north of Los Angeles. She and her husband bought a home there, paid off their mortgage and bought a second home nearby. Now she is a candidate for deportation again, and is anxious each time she steps outside. ''I am in limbo,'' she said. ''I am afraid I will go out and never come back.''\par \par \uc2 FEW NEMESES LOOMED LARGER in the narrative of President Trump's presidential campaign than the figure of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who threatened Americans -- one of the ''rapists'' and ''killers'' from Mexico, as Mr. Trump has put it. Such people do exist. The \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2  has estimated that 820,000 of the 11 million unauthorized have been convicted of a crime. About 300,000, or fewer than 3 percent of the 11 million undocumented, have committed felonies. (The proportion of felons in the overall population was 6 percent in 2010, according to a paper presented to the Population Association of America.) Immigration agents regularly arrest what the government calls ''criminal aliens.'' At the end of January, agents arrested a 50- year-old Mexican man near Milwaukee who had felony convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, battery against a police officer, car theft and intentionally harming a child, and who had been deported twice before. Last month, they caught an undocumented Honduran man in North Carolina, Francisco Escobar-Orellana, who is wanted in Honduras for allegedly hacking two men to death with a machete in 1993. The Trump administration has said it will continue to prioritize deporting those with serious criminal records, but, in a break with the Obama administration, the new policies also take aim at immigrants whose offenses are limited to living here without permission or minor crimes that enable immigrants to work here, like driving without a license or using a fake Social Security number. The \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  estimated that in 2010, 1.8 million undocumented immigrants worked under a number not matching their name. Surrounded by the sugar cane fields of Clewiston, Fla., working backbreaking jobs, Maria and Benjamin took pains to follow the rules, pay taxes and stay out of the way. But now they fear the one rule Benjamin had to break to survive -- he used a fraudulent Social Security number to secure a job -- may prove their undoing. Benjamin, 42, fixes the hydraulic trucks used for the area's cane-cutting operation, which means he works 17 hours a day, often at night. ''This worries us, but we don't have an option,'' said Maria, 38, who arrived from Mexico when she was 19. ''He has always worked and has always had a fake Social Security card. That is the way you get a job.''\par \par \uc2 SOME PEOPLE ENDURE long journeys by foot, train, boat -- some using smugglers -- to make it across the border. But for an increasing number of immigrants, illegal status arrives overnight, without a single step. In each year from 2007 to 2014, more people joined the ranks of the illegal by remaining in the United States after their temporary visitor permits expired than by creeping across the Mexican border, according to a report by researchers at the Center for Migration Studies. A partial government estimate released last year said that 416,500 people whose business or tourist visas had expired in 2015 were still in the country in 2016. That does not count people who came here on student visas or temporary worker permits. Numbers like these have convinced some conservatives that the federal government needs to worry more about people who abuse their temporary legal status than about border security. In 2005, tourist visas brought Wei Lee and his parents to San Francisco from Brazil, where Mr. Lee's parents, who had emigrated from China, ran a restaurant outside S\u227\'00\'E3o Paulo. They remained in the United States after the visas expired. After being mugged and beaten in 2013, Mr. Lee recently received a U visa, which is reserved for victims of crime. His parents, however, are still undocumented. ''Some people misunderstand, they think people come here and overstay their visas intentionally, but there are all these push and pull factors,'' said Mr. Lee, 28, a college graduate who now works with Asian undocumented youth. ''My parents had to make a decision for their lives.'' After the expiration of the tourist visa that Rebeca, a former television reporter from Venezuela, used to enter the United States, she found work as a nanny, then got a job as a designer at a clothing business in Southern California. Rebeca, now 30, said she had left Venezuela after being attacked and receiving death threats for protesting against the government after the death of \uc2 Hugo Ch\u225\'00\'E1vez\uc2 . She has applied for asylum, but it will be years before her case is even considered: In Los Angeles, immigration officials are currently scheduling hearings for people who first applied in 2011.\par \par \uc2 ONE REASON PRESIDENT TRUMP and many proponents of curbing immigration see the Mexican border as alarmingly porous is that thousands of people each year are convicted of illegally re-entering the country after being previously deported. In the 2015 fiscal year alone, 15,715 were convicted, according to the \uc2 United States Sentencing Commission\uc2 . About a quarter of people caught crossing the southwest border that year had done it at least once before, according to a \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  report. That said, the number of people convicted of illegal re-entry has declined by more than a quarter over the last five years. In December 2013, border security agents caught Clemente Armenta-Velasquez trying to return to the United States near Nogales, Ariz. After arriving in the United States in 2000, he had lived and worked in Arizona, where, records show, he was prosecuted on drug charges in 2002. He also served time in prison after being convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a felony, in 2010. He was deported the next year. Mr. Armenta-Velasquez's lawyer told a federal judge that his client, who had left school after fifth grade, had tried to come back to support his wife and three children in Mexico. ''He couldn't find a job in Mexico that would give a decent life for his family,'' said the lawyer, Ricardo Bours, according to court papers. Before sentencing Mr. Armenta-Velasquez to 57 months in prison, after which he will almost certainly be sent back to Mexico again, the judge suggested that Mr. Armenta-Velasquez might have been ordered deported as many as six times in the past. ''I knew I wasn't supposed to'' return, Mr. Armenta-Velasquez said in court. ''I did it out of great need, but I apologize for that.''\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 A supporter of an undocumented immigrant, Jeanette Vizguerra, in Denver last month.

\par\par \uc2 Washington; SECT\par {\*\bkmkstart toc26}{\*\bkmkend toc26}\b \uc2 Trump's Speech to Congress: Video and Transcript\b0\par\par\uc2 5,332 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump on Tuesday delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress. The following is a transcript, as prepared by the Federal News Service.\par \par \uc2 For more coverage, read our live analysis.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... and citizens of America, tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.\par \par \uc2 Recent threats ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world.\par \par \uc2 I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.\par \par \uc2 But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.\par \par \uc2 For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places throughout our land.\par \par \uc2 We've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross [Fact check: Open in parts, but heavily patrolled as well.], and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\par \par \uc2 Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.\par \par \uc2 But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.\par \par \uc2 Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.\par \par \uc2 Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank you. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, \uc2 Fiat-Chrysler\uc2  , \uc2 General Motors\uc2  , Sprint, Softbank, \uc2 Lockheed\uc2  , Intel, \uc2 Walmart\uc2  and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on Nov. 8, a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic -- and it is a fantastic -- new F-35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.\par \par \uc2 We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers.\par \par \uc2 We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials -- and a lifetime ban ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... and we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We're going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners. [Fact check: This is partly true but misleading.]\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. [Fact check: This needs context.] And I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation. [Fact check: True, but they don't do much.]\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages [Fact check: Maybe a little.], help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.\par \par \uc2 We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. [Fact check: Not a big change.] Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.\par \par \uc2 It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE) That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, and to keep those out who will do us harm.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2  , from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.\par \par \uc2 To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. [Fact check: This is misleading.] Over 43 million people are now living in poverty. [Fact check: True -- but the number has also fallen.] And over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. [Fact check: The number is correct.]\par \par \uc2 More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined.\par \par \uc2 We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since Nafta was approved [Fact check: Not because of Nafta.], and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.\par \par \uc2 Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 It will be a big, big cut.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers -- have to do it.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.\par \par \uc2 I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, \uc2 Harley-Davidson\uc2  . In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, ''No, thank you.''\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 At our meeting, I asked them, ''How are you doing? How is business?'' They said that it's good. I asked them further, ''How are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?''\par \par \uc2 They told me -- without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it -- that it's very hard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.\par \par \uc2 They weren't even asking for a change. But I am. I believe ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a long time since we had fair trade.\par \par \uc2 The first Republican president, \uc2 Abraham Lincoln\uc2 , warned that ''the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.''\par \par \uc2 Lincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken -- advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country no longer.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 It's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 National Academy of Sciences\uc2  , our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. [Fact check: This needs context.] Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security and to restore respect for our laws.\par \par \uc2 If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program: the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.\par \par \uc2 With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American and hire American.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. [Fact check: True, but cherry-picked.] As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state, the state of Kentucky, and it's unsustainable and collapsing.\par \par \uc2 One third of the counties have only one insurer, and they're losing them fast, they are losing them so fast. They're leaving. And many Americans have no choice at all. There's no choice left.\par \par \uc2 Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing [Fact check: This is an exaggeration.], and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Action is not a choice; it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans.\par \par \uc2 First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.\par \par \uc2 Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.\par \par \uc2 An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.\par \par \uc2 If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A. but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind -- and the souls -- of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning -- great learning center -- with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year, she will get her master's degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. [Fact check: True, but somewhat misleading.] In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 But to create this future, we must work with -- not against -- not against -- the men and women of law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity and it's -- really, it's what it is, division. It's pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.\par \par \uc2 We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media [Fact check: They have received coverage.] and silenced by special interests. Joining us ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.\par \par \uc2 But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands -- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis -- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.\par \par \uc2 Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war -- if they must -- they have to fight and they only have to win.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\par \par \uc2 My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 The challenges we face as a nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William ''Ryan'' Owens. Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I just spoke to our great General [Jim] Mattis just now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ''Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.''\par \par \uc2 Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he's very happy, because I think he just broke a record.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.\par \par \uc2 We strongly support \uc2 NATO\uc2  , an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism ...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... and a Cold War and defeated communism.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We expect our partners, whether in \uc2 NATO\uc2  , in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost -- have to do that.\par \par \uc2 We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations. And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world. All across the world.\par \par \uc2 The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\par \par \uc2 Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.\par \par \uc2 On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. \uc2 Thomas Edison\uc2  showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before, for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny.\par \par \uc2 We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we are all made by the same God.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.\par \par \uc2 From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.\par \par \uc2 I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment. Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170301ed310006r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump on Thursday announced his new nominee for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, during a news conference at the White House. Following is a transcript of that event, as prepared by the Federal News Service.\par \par \uc2 For more coverage, read our live analysis.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student; former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He's a member and has been a member of the \uc2 National Labor Relations Board\uc2 , and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed; did very, very well.\par \par \uc2 And so Alex, I've wished him the best. We just spoke. And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous secretary of labor.\par \par \uc2 And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition.\par \par \uc2 Paul Singer\uc2  just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, ''never Trump.'' And Paul just left and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time. It's very, very important to me.\par \par \uc2 So I want to thank \uc2 Paul Singer\uc2  for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.\par \par \uc2 I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time. We've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible; just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that.\par \par \uc2 And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That's always a possibility.\par \par \uc2 I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.\par \par \uc2 A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it -- much of the media doesn't get it. They actually get it, but they don't write it. Let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, ''Oh, that's good.'' Now it means, ''That's good for jobs.'' Very different.\par \par \uc2 Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league -- \uc2 Ford\uc2 , \uc2 General Motors\uc2 , so many of them. I'm making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit -- a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's OK, too.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.\par \par \uc2 I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking -- and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure; we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort -- not all the time -- and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say -- they're honest and fantastic.\par \par \uc2 But much of it is not a -- the distortion -- and we'll talk about it, you'll be able to ask me questions about it. But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country; you see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea -- we'll take care of it folks; we're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.\par \par \uc2 Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you've covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand.\par \par \uc2 We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs. It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He's over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it's in large sections of the world.\par \par \uc2 They've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer -- another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism, and we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it's not properly solved now, it's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody. I've ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I've had great from Congress, generally.\par \par \uc2 We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my -- I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it; I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it's depleted -- it won't be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I'm standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.\par \par \uc2 We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders.\par \par \uc2 Well, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They're so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that's what I've been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular but they're necessary for security and for other reasons.\par \par \uc2 And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I'm here following through on what I pledged to do. That's all I'm doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn't supposed to get 222. They said there's no way to get 222, 230's impossible.\par \par \uc2 270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media's trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.\par \par \uc2 And -- but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida five o'clock on Saturday and I heard -- just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T.V., open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my cabinet approved.\par \par \uc2 And they're outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who's there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can't get approved. How do you not approve him? He's been a colleague -- highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We're waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about and we can't let that happen.\par \par \uc2 So, if the Democrats who have -- all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.\par \par \uc2 I'll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks -- in the weeks coming. We've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We're going to make trade deals but we're going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We're going to have one on one deals.\par \par \uc2 We've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it's many, many years. And then at the end of the process -- they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected.\par \par \uc2 Now, they may be rejected with me but it's going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it's going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don't want the jobs going to other countries. We've imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.\par \par \uc2 We've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody's ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say ''let me see your regulations'' and they're fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental -- all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It's very important to me. But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.\par \par \uc2 We've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible.\par \par \uc2 We've ordered the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We're becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer.\par \par \uc2 We've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general -- now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we're starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either nonexistent or a joke.\par \par \uc2 We've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day.\par \par \uc2 The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order.\par \par \uc2 I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places.\par \par \uc2 In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is -- that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.\par \par \uc2 We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C., I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.\par \par \uc2 We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is's disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing.\par \par \uc2 So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It's already happening. But big league.\par \par \uc2 I've also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history.\par \par \uc2 You look at \uc2 Rex Tillerson\uc2 . He's out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.\par \par \uc2 Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.\par \par \uc2 Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.\par \par \uc2 Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, \uc2 Ford\uc2  announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.\par \par \uc2 Fiat Chrysler\uc2  announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here.\par \par \uc2 General Motors\uc2  likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.\par \par \uc2 Intel\uc2  just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.\par \par \uc2 Walmart\uc2  announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we're naming.\par \par \uc2 Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we're not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.\par \par \uc2 And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he'll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.\par \par \uc2 This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week.\par \par \uc2 Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there.\par \par \uc2 And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.\par \par \uc2 Mara (ph), Mara (ph), go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.\par \par \uc2 He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem.\par \par \uc2 And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- that they know nothing about it; they weren't in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia; they never received a phone call.\par \par \uc2 It's all fake news. It's all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal -- I think it's very important -- the illegal, giving out classified information. It was -- and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.\par \par \uc2 I'll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that's -- I spoke to the president of Mexico; I had a good call. All of a sudden, it's out there for the world to see. It's supposed to be secret. It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.\par \par \uc2 Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I'm saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it?\par \par \uc2 You know why? Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.\par \par \uc2 Yes, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, ''I don't think he did anything wrong; if anything, he did something right.'' He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, ''Huh, that's fine.'' That's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to -- he didn't just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He's doing the job.\par \par \uc2 You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.\par \par \uc2 But he didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.\par \par \uc2 Yes?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)? TRUMP: The failing \uc2 New York Times\uc2  wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was -- it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren't even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part. They -- I hadn't spoken to them.\par \par \uc2 I think the one person -- I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.\par \par \uc2 The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that.\par \par \uc2 That's Mr. Manafort, who's -- by the way, who's by the way a respected man. He's a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody -- people knew that. Everybody knew that.\par \par \uc2 So, these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.\par \par \uc2 He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that's the extent.\par \par \uc2 Russia is fake news. Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.\par \par \uc2 As you know, Mike Pompeo has -- has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at \uc2 FBI\uc2 , Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he's still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.\par \par \uc2 And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time's story, yesterday. And it talked about -- these are (ph) front page.\par \par \uc2 So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.\par \par \uc2 So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I've never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.\par \par \uc2 But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , put it on front page?\par \par \uc2 That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.\par \par \uc2 And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.\par \par \uc2 OK, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph), or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 (OFF-MIKE).\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Obama (OFF-MIKE) 426 on (OFF-MIKE). So why should Americans...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...I'm skipping that information, I don't know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) why should Americans trust you (OFF-MIKE) the information (OFF-MIKE)?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I don't know, I was given that information. I was given -- I actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that's...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did -- whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with?\par \par \uc2 What-- what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We are.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can we ask what you're going to do and also, we've heard about a -- a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they're in position so I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.\par \par \uc2 The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he's offered his services and you know, it's something we may take advantage of. But I don't think we're need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.\par \par \uc2 As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.\par \par \uc2 It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said ''well I don't see'' -- to me, he was doing the job.\par \par \uc2 The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said ''doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there.'' But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.\par \par \uc2 That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So -- and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks -- on the leaks, sir...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...Go ahead. Finish off then I'll get you.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You've said twice today...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...Yes, we're looking at them very -- very, very serious. I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They're put out by people either in agencies -- I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.\par \par \uc2 We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It's a criminal act. You know what I say, when I -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.\par \par \uc2 But I said ''you know, it doesn't make sense. That won't happen'' but that wasn't that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who's a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said ''that's terrible that it was leaked'' but it wasn't that important. But then I said to myself ''what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?''\par \par \uc2 What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very -- you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don't want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.\par \par \uc2 So I'm dealing with Mexico, I'm dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the ''\uc2 Washington Post\uc2 '' and gets put into the ''\uc2 New York Times\uc2 '' and I'm saying ''what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?\par \par \uc2 We got to stop it. That's why it's a criminal penalty.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it. Because there's nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.\par \par \uc2 It's very important to me and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true and, you know, over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm OK with that. But I'm not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch \uc2 CNN\uc2 , it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.\par \par \uc2 I don't watch it any more because it's very good -- he's saying no. It's OK, Jim (ph). It's OK, Jim (ph), you'll have your chance. But I watch others too. You're not the only one so don't feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be -- I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody's ratings are right now but I think that actually -- I think that'd actually be better.\par \par \uc2 People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that's right. I don't know, Peter (ph), is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower -- I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I'd appreciate it -- again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I think we're setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I'm looking, some of them had them approved immediately.\par \par \uc2 I'm going forever and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for. And that's all they're doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they'd be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody's good.\par \par \uc2 And sometimes -- I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that's OK. That's fine. But I think it would -- I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics.\par \par \uc2 And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information. They're giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.\par \par \uc2 Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine -- seriously -- can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric -- you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We'll do you next Jim, I do you next(ph).\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) clarify --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I didn't.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- prior to your -- TRUMP: No, I didn't.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- inauguration.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I didn't.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: And then fired him --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 . Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it.\par \par \uc2 I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job. And it came out that way -- and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I've watched many other people say that.\par \par \uc2 No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it. OK? Jim?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don't hate you. I don't hate you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So, pass that along --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Ask -- ask \uc2 Jeff Zucker\uc2  how he got his job. OK?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, that's -- well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: It's pretty good right now, actually.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK, go ahead, John.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  was revealing information about the \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I was OK with it.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- you said -- you said that you loved \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 . At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails. I'm wondering, sir, if you -- TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Then(ph), your(ph) numbers(ph) were off too.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No -- no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If -- if I may ask you, sir, it -- it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during(ph) the campaign --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No -- no, but let me do one at a time.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may as a follow up?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Do you mind?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Yes, sir.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you're talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you're talking about \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.\par \par \uc2 He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information. But in one case, you're talking about classified -- regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.\par \par \uc2 I don't want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn't even in the papers.\par \par \uc2 Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she -- and she should have reported herself.\par \par \uc2 Why did \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  announce that, ''I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in \uc2 CNN\uc2  for not doing a good job.'' QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don't understand. It seems that there's a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know what it is? Here's the thing. The public isn't -- you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved. I'm involved. I've been involved with this stuff all my life. But I'm involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not. I just see many, many untruthful things.\par \par \uc2 And I'll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word ''tone.'' The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that -- the tone is such hatred.\par \par \uc2 I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. It's the most honest.\par \par \uc2 But the tone, Jim. If you look -- the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth; the hatred coming from other people on your network.\par \par \uc2 Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I'm amazed by it. And I just think you'd be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at \uc2 CNN\uc2 . They want to throw their placards at \uc2 CNN\uc2 . You know.\par \par \uc2 I -- I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's -- it's brutal.\par \par \uc2 Now, they'll take this news conference -- I'm actually having a very good time, OK? But they'll take this news conference -- don't forget, that's the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK?\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people. That's for sure. But I'm having a good time.\par \par \uc2 Tomorrow, they will say, ''\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  rants and raves at the press.'' I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it.\par \par \uc2 But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, ''\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  rants and raves.'' I'm not ranting and raving.\par \par \uc2 Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may, just one more followup...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have -- let him have a little bit more?\par \par \uc2 Sit down. Sit down. We'll...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm changing it from fake news, though.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Doesn't that under...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Very fake news.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ... I know, but aren't you...\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And you're not related to our new...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I looked -- you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm sure you checked that out, sir.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK. Now I checked it -- I said -- they said, ''No, sir.'' I said, ''Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.''\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: But aren't you -- aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don't like ''fake news''? Why not just say it's a story I don't like.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I do that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: When you call it ''fake news,'' you're undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here's the thing. OK. I understand what you're -- and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I'll say, ''Wow, that's going to be a great story.'' And I'll get killed.\par \par \uc2 I know what's good and bad. I'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what's good. I know what's bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive -- sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make OK. They'll even make it negative.\par \par \uc2 So I understand it. So, because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who's saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me.\par \par \uc2 Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?\par \par \uc2 Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go -- as an example, you're \uc2 CNN\uc2 , I mean it's story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running -- this is a fine-tuned machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph).\par \par \uc2 You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I'm saying ''here's my chief of staff,'' a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right?\par \par \uc2 We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some -- all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job. And I said to myself, you know -- and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said ''you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.'' I mean, they're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame because he'd rather be working on healthcare, he'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph).\par \par \uc2 I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there's a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know -- you know, whatever reason. But -- and I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair and that's why the public sees it. They see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.\par \par \uc2 And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible) ...for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news? And second...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...I think they don't believe it. I don't think the public -- that's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.\par \par \uc2 Now tomorrow, you'll say ''\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.'' It's not terrible. It's good. We had \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  try and do a reset. We had \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.\par \par \uc2 Nobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  gave them 20 percent of our uranium. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  -- that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, \uc2 Rex Tillerson\uc2 , who's going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said ''I know politically it's probably not good for me.'' The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles off shore right out of the water.\par \par \uc2 Everyone in this country's going to say ''oh, it's so great.'' That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you've had a lot of presidents that haven't taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can -- now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But -- but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.\par \par \uc2 Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said ''you know.'' He's sitting behind his desk and he's saying ''you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It's going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story.'' OK?\par \par \uc2 And that's a shame because if we could get along with Russia -- and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare. We're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner.\par \par \uc2 So we'll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March, mid- March. And after that, we're going to come up, and we're doing very well on tax reform.\par \par \uc2 Yes?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel -- the spy vessel off the coast of the United States.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Not good.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries; and a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Not good.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign ...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, ''Hey, we're back to the old games with the United States; there's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us.'' Because the -- you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, ''Oh, isn't that wonderful.'' But I know you well enough.\par \par \uc2 Then you would say, ''Oh, he was too tough; he shouldn't have done that.'' Look, all of the...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  tries a reset. It failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people.\par \par \uc2 Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given \uc2 Rex Tillerson\uc2  any advice or counsel on how to deal?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic.\par \par \uc2 Yes, I think that I've already...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.\par \par \uc2 Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.\par \par \uc2 Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.\par \par \uc2 If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no upside. We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.\par \par \uc2 They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Who did I say is not good?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they're not good.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, it's not good, but they happened.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They all happened recently.\par \par \uc2 No...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ... this country's ability to work with Russia?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they're doing because they're doing the same thing.\par \par \uc2 Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don't, does anybody really think that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  would be tougher on Russia than \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK?\par \par \uc2 But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I'm close to Russia. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She's close to Russia.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can we...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don't talk about military response. I don't say I'm going into Mosul in four months. ''We are going to attack Mosul in four months.'' Then three months later, ''We are going to attack Mosul in one month.'' ''Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.''\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things, you're going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that. So I don't have to tell you. I don't want to be one of these guys that say, ''Yes, here's what we're going to do.'' I don't have to do that. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won't have to do anything, but I'm not going to tell you.\par \par \uc2 OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Could I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Where are you from?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: \uc2 BBC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Here's another beauty.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: That's a good line. Impartial, free and fair.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah. Sure.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Just like \uc2 CNN\uc2  right?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: On the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Were there any mistakes...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait.\par \par \uc2 Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it's 80 percent of the time, a lot.\par \par \uc2 We had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision.\par \par \uc2 That's the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.\par \par \uc2 Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.\par \par \uc2 Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a one-month period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones.\par \par \uc2 You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.\par \par \uc2 Kelly said you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don't have time to come in.\par \par \uc2 Now nobody ever reports that. But that's why we did it quickly.\par \par \uc2 Now, if I would've done it a month, everything would've been perfect. The problem is we would've wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would've come into our country.\par \par \uc2 Now in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Just a brief follow-up. But if it's so urgent, why not introduce...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that's one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: During the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So you're not aware of any contact during the course..\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Look, look, look...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ... of the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no? TRUMP: Russia is a ruse.\par \par \uc2 I know you have to get up and ask a question. It's so important.\par \par \uc2 Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't. I just have nobody to speak to.\par \par \uc2 I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago.\par \par \uc2 We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I'm sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk.\par \par \uc2 I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.\par \par \uc2 Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he -- now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right?\par \par \uc2 He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , who's a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President, on national...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait. Let's see. Who's -- I want to find a friendly reporter.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr....\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven't seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being (OFF-MIKE).\par \par \uc2 Because (OFF-MIKE). However, what we've already heard about and what we (OFF-MIKE) is (OFF-MIKE) so you're general forecast (ph) like 48 (OFF-MIKE). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the (OFF-MIKE)...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP:...he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not, its not, not -- not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question.\par \par \uc2 So here's the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti- Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican -- quiet, quiet, quiet.\par \par \uc2 See, he lied about -- he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive.\par \par \uc2 I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I've known \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  for a long time and then he said, forget it.\par \par \uc2 So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, I'm Lisa (ph) from the...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the \uc2 PBS\uc2  News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: It's a very fair question.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ...countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Right.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We're gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.\par \par \uc2 In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they're gang members and they're drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way -- it's a very -- it's a very, very tough subject.\par \par \uc2 We're gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is -- is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.\par \par \uc2 But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.\par \par \uc2 I'm not talking about new laws, I'm talking the existing law, is very rough, it's very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision.\par \par \uc2 But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.\par \par \uc2 And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ...reopening of the White House Visitors Office?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what's first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Now, that's what I call a nice question. That is very -- who are you with?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Good, I'm gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania's terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely.\par \par \uc2 And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania's gonna be outstanding, that's right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House.\par \par \uc2 She, like others that she's working with, feel very, very strongly about women's issue, women's difficulties. Very, very strongly, she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country.\par \par \uc2 And a funny thing happens, because she gets -- she gets so unfairly -- Melania, the things they say. I've known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well.\par \par \uc2 She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say -- I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.\par \par \uc2 I'll just tell you this. I think she's going to be a fantastic first lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money.\par \par \uc2 They're not doing this for pay, they're doing this because they feel it; both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that's a very nice question.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that's OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: It doesn't(ph) have(ph) to be a bad question.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you're --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Fix the inner cities.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- president. Fixing the inner cities.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yep.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that's coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn't bad, was it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That was very professional and very good.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm very professional.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We'll be announcing the order in a little while and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.\par \par \uc2 I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.\par \par \uc2 And by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know, it takes a long time.\par \par \uc2 It's taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we're going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we're going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime.\par \par \uc2 You go to some of these inner city places and it's so sad when you look at the crime. You have people -- and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it -- in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.\par \par \uc2 They're living in hell. We can't let that happen. So, we're going to be very, very strong. That's a great question and -- and it's a -- it's a very difficult situation because it's been many, many years. It's been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix.\par \par \uc2 We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know.\par \par \uc2 There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all -- and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.\par \par \uc2 I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going -- are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your -- your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Am I going to include who?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Are you going to include the \uc2 Congressional Black Caucus\uc2  and the Congressional --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- Hispanic Caucus --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: No -- no -- no. I'm not --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Are they friends of yours?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm just a reporter.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, then(ph) set up the meeting.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great, the \uc2 Congressional Black Caucus\uc2 . I think it's great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can't move, it might be bad for me politically. I can't have that meeting.\par \par \uc2 I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can't make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told -- he was probably told ''don't meet with Trump. It's bad politics.''\par \par \uc2 And that's part of the problem in this country. OK, one more.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can't handle. This room can't handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible) ...not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible), some of it by supporters in your name. What do you...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...And some of it -- can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don't think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or like \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , they're put up by the other side and you think it's like playing it straight?\par \par \uc2 No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They'll do signs and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: You're the president now. What are you going to do about it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: What are you going to do about -- what are you going to do about (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Oh, I'm working on it. I'm working on it very -- no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided -- I didn't come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.\par \par \uc2 We're going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that's part of it. But we're going to work on education, we're going to work on -- you know, we're going to stop -- we're going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we're going to try and stop crime.\par \par \uc2 We're not going to try and stop, we're going to stop crime. But it's very important to me -- but this isn't \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try -- I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much.\par \par \uc2 It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks.\par \par \uc2 END\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170217ed2h0006x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- In an extraordinarily swift return to politicking after a tumultuous first month in office, the White House on Wednesday said President Trump will hold the first campaign rally of his four-week-old administration on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 The rally, to be held in an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Fla., is an indication that Mr. Trump, who has sometimes felt isolated in the White House, is eager to get outside of Washington and relive the rapturous reception that greeted him during the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump exulted in large crowds assembled at cavernous venues throughout his 2016 bid, and spent the first days of his presidency quibbling over how many Americans attended his inauguration.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, during a joint news conference with Prime Minister \uc2 Benjamin Netanyahu\uc2  of Israel, Mr. Trump answered a question about whether his administration was flirting with xenophobia and racism in part by noting the support he received in the election.\par \par \uc2 ''I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had -- 306 Electoral College votes,'' Mr. Trump said. ''There's tremendous enthusiasm out there.''\par \par \uc2 Not long after, in a posting on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , Mr. Trump invited his nearly 25 million followers to attend the Saturday evening event, which will take place just up the coast from his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach where he plans to spend the weekend. It will be his third weekend in a row on Florida's Gold Coast.\par \par \uc2 ''We are going to put America back to work,'' a message accompanying the posting said. ''We are going to put people before government.''\par \par \uc2 The White House would not provide any additional information about the rally. Officials referred questions to a member of Mr. Trump's political organization, who also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 ''It's being run by the campaign,'' \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2 , the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday, without elaborating. He would not say why the president would be holding a campaign rally so soon after taking office.\par \par \uc2 The rally will be only the second public appearance by Mr. Trump outside of Washington since he took office. On Friday, he is scheduled to visit a \uc2 Boeing\uc2  plant in North Charleston, S.C., for the unveiling of the aerospace manufacturer's new Dreamliner aircraft.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump filed paperwork with the \uc2 Federal Election Commission\uc2  for his 2020 re-election campaign on Jan. 20, the day he was sworn in. That allowed him to continue to accept contributions -- including proceeds from the sales of his popular red ''Make America Great Again'' hats -- without running afoul of the law.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump ended the 2016 campaign flush with funds, in part because of substantial sales of the hats. At the end of 2016, he had $7,611,702.92 cash on hand and no debt.\par \par \uc2 The rally comes at a precarious time for Mr. Trump, as his White House is reeling from personnel turmoil and has yet to score any legislative victories. On Tuesday, he accepted the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who had become embroiled in allegations that he had improper contacts with Russian officials before Mr. Trump took office. That was followed on Wednesday by the abrupt withdrawal of \uc2 Andrew F. Puzder\uc2 , the president's nominee to be secretary of labor, amid allegations that he had abused his ex-wife and employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump had vowed to move quickly to put his policy agenda in place once in the White House. But his effort to use executive power to crack down on immigration has faltered in the face of legal challenges, and his administration has yet to issue a proposal either for repealing the health care law he railed against during the campaign or enacting the tax overhaul he has promised.\par \par \uc2 Larry M. Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group, said he was not aware of any president having held a campaign rally this early in his tenure.\par \par \uc2 ''Usually, they are too busy trying to get their administration in place,'' Mr. Noble said. ''More importantly, normally the president wants to delay candidate status so that he can travel as president making speeches, announcing new policies and actions, promoting his agenda and attacking his opponents in Congress without having to use campaign funds.''\par \par \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  did not file his statement of candidacy for re-election until April 2011, more than two years after he took office, while George W. Bush waited until May of 2003 and \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  until April of 1995.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump may be moving now, Mr. Noble said, to ensure he can address a friendly crowd devoid of protesters.\par \par \uc2 ''My guess is that he intends to control who is invited to the rally and press access by calling the rally a candidate event and paying for it out of campaign funds,'' Mr. Noble said. ''If it was an official White House event, he would have less control over it.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump is likely to travel to the event on Air Force One and will have a sizable contingent of Secret Service and staff aides with him, as presidents always do when they travel. Campaign finance laws dictate that the cost of such a flight be shared between the campaign organizing the rally and the White House.\par \par \uc2 It is not abnormal for a sitting president to hold a political rally in the months before an election, and Mr. Trump has said he plans to campaign actively for Republicans who support him and against Democrats who seek to stymie his agenda. But Mr. Trump's return to the campaign trail on Saturday is unusually early. Even the midterm congressional elections for members of Congress are still 21 months away.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 A postelection rally for President Trump at the Wisconsin State Fair Exposition Center last year.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc29}{\*\bkmkend toc29}\b \uc2 Reports of Raids Shake the Undocumented\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICHOLAS KULISH, CAITLIN DICKERSON and LIZ ROBBINS; Reporting was contributed by Ron Nixon, Ciaran McEvoy, Jennifer Medina, Meredith Hoffman, Manny Fernandez and Richard Fausset. \par \uc2 1,427 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In Austin, Tex., undocumented women working in a laundromat cowered in the back of the room, petrified after seeing a video and a photograph of apprehensions outside a local grocery store and burger joint.\par \par \uc2 A day laborer and mechanic in Staten Island told his 17-year-old son where the list of emergency contacts were, including the name of the guardian who would take responsibility for him and his two younger siblings.\par \par \uc2 In Savannah, Ga., undocumented restaurant workers were asking for rides rather than walking home, afraid they might be stopped and questioned.\par \par \uc2 As reports of immigration raids and roundups have rocketed across \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and texts around the country, undocumented immigrants, their lawyers and advocacy groups are bracing for the increased enforcement that President Trump has called for.\par \par \uc2 Susannah Volpe, a managing attorney at Ayuda, an immigrant legal services group in Washington, said she had noticed what seemed to be roundups of people, like those without criminal records, that the government had not previously paid much attention to.\par \par \uc2 ''These are agents going into apartment buildings or agents going to worksites,'' said Ms. Volpe, who had a client arrested, along with five others, at a construction site in Washington last week. ''This is new.''\par \par \uc2 School principals in Los Angeles have been sent a checklist of things to do in case immigration agents turn up. The Mexican government even warned ''the entire Mexican community'' in the United States ''to take precautions and to keep in touch with their nearest consulate,'' after the deportation of a woman who had previously been allowed to remain in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Her case ''illustrates the new reality'' in the United States, said the message, from the foreign ministry.\par \par \uc2 In an executive order Jan. 25, Mr. Trump greatly expanded the categories of undocumented immigrants who would now be priorities for deportation, in keeping with his campaign pledge to be tough on illegal immigration. But despite numerous reports of mass roundups, it was still unclear Friday whether the promised surge in enforcement had actually begun.\par \par \uc2 Officials at \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , or ICE, said the immigration roundups that people were seeing did not represent an increased tempo. The agency has about 100 fugitive teams constantly working to bring in those wanted on a variety of immigration offenses, and these teams have been just as active as they were during the Obama administration, officials said. In 2012, the most active year for deportations during Mr. Obama's presidency, 409,849 people were deported.\par \par \uc2 In a news release Friday, ICE described as routine a five-day ''targeted enforcement action'' in which roughly 160 people were arrested in six counties around Los Angeles. Of those, 150 had criminal histories, some of them serious.\par \par \uc2 Some had already been ordered deported before Mr. Trump took office; according to ICE statistics, there are 960,000 people with deportation orders who are not in custody.\par \par \uc2 ''The rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible,'' ICE said in a statement Friday. ''These reports create panic and put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger.''\par \par \uc2 Officials noted, however, that they did expected the numbers and deportations to increase in line with the president's order. In Los Angeles, for example, the county sheriff's department was told by ICE that it planned to issue ''detainers'' for every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  charged with a crime, no matter how serious, according to Capt. Elier Morejon.\par \par \uc2 Jonathan Blazer, the advocacy and policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the group had been wary of deportation tactics for years.\par \par \uc2 ''One challenge here is that every single enforcement action done outside the jail looks like Trump's deportation force,'' he said. ''But as we know, under Obama enforcement was very high.''\par \par \uc2 ''The distinguishing factor under Trump is justifiable fear and anxiety,'' he added. ''Those are categorically new.''\par \par \uc2 Though New York City is a so-called sanctuary city where the police and jail officials do not automatically cooperate with immigration agents, undocumented immigrants can still be picked up in many places.\par \par \uc2 Patricia Lavelle, a public defender in New York who represents immigrants in criminal cases, has begun telling her clients about the two main places where they could be apprehended by immigration officials: outside of courthouses before or after appearances, or at home, if they are living at the same address that they provided to the police when they were charged.\par \par \uc2 ''I'll ask, 'Are you still at that address? Because if you are not, it's harder for them to find you,' '' she said, ''You sort of let them put two and two together.''\par \par \uc2 As to whether that advice could lead some clients to avoid showing up for court -- lawyers are not supposed to encourage clients to become fugitives -- ''there is a tension there,'' Ms. Lavelle said.\par \par \uc2 ''But I would tell them that a warrant issued for your arrest is not something you would want.''\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocacy groups like \uc2 Make the Road New York\uc2  have been holding regular ''Know Your Rights'' workshops in case ICE comes to the door, and one on Wednesday in Queens drew 40 people.\par \par \uc2 On the advice of La Colmena, a group that assists day laborers in Staten Island, Armando, 45, who asked that his last name not be used because he is in the country illegally, filled out an emergency packet, hid it inside his home and told his oldest son, Johnny, where to find it. ''He told me, 'Do not worry, nothing is going to happen,' '' Armando said. ''I don't know if he says that to keep us calm or because he just does not want to think about it.''\par \par \uc2 Esmeralda, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico in Alexandria, Va., is trying to find a new place to live with her 2-year-old daughter after her husband was deported to Mexico after a routine check-in at an \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  field office. She is now wondering if she should apply for a visa -- which could end up in her becoming legal, or put her at risk because it notifies the government of her presence here.\par \par \uc2 ''I have to look out for her,'' she said of her daughter. ''It's just me and her now.''\par \par \uc2 In Savannah, the immigrant community has been on high alert this week. Social media posts spread around town, warning of the presence of ICE agents in various trailer parks, and informing people of their rights if confronted by an agent.\par \par \uc2 ''Attention, people of Savannah and the surrounding areas,'' declared a Spanish-language message posted Wednesday on the popular \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page Latinos Mexicanos Savannah, which was subsequently shared more than 400 times. ''This is to inform you that we have been notified that immigration agents (ICE) are going to the trailers, knocking and taking people away.'' It continued, ''Be very careful.''\par \par \uc2 In Austin on Friday, more than a dozen women in a laundromat were trading news in Spanish gleaned from text messages and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  feeds about enforcement actions in the area. In one case, an ICE agent was injured during a scuffle with a man who had been arrested in a parking lot, according to the agency.\par \par \uc2 ''There's no doubt that ICE officers have significantly more presence in Austin, and they are arresting people at street stops,'' said Denise Gilman, director of the University of Texas Immigration Law Clinic. She said it appeared the agency was targeting people who already had deportation orders against them, and then catching others in their dragnet.\par \par \uc2 One woman in the laundromat, who is 42 years old and asked not to be named because she came here illegally from Mexico, wrote down a list of phone numbers for her boss, who is documented, and arranged for her boss to pick up her 11-year-old son from school if she was detained.\par \par \uc2 ''I wanted to throw up, but now I have a plan so I feel calmer,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Esmeralda needs a place to live with her daughter after her husband was deported to Mexico.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 NEW HAVEN -- Anthony Barroso was 13 and getting ready for school when they came for his father.\par \par \uc2 As soon as Anthony opened the door, he knew the half-dozen men outside were not local police officers. They carried heavy weaponry, and their bulletproof vests read ''ICE,'' short for \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 They arrested and deported Anthony's father, an Ecuadorean who had been illegally working as a contractor here for over a decade. One officer warned Anthony, as his infant sister cried, that they would soon return for his mother.\par \par \uc2 ''Everything fell apart after that,'' said Anthony, whose single mother fell deeper into poverty after the family breadwinner was deported. He is now a student at a community college and was allowed to stay in the United States under a reprieve signed by President Obama.\par \par \uc2 The 2007 raid was one of the hundreds of coordinated federal sweeps targeting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers carried out during President George W. Bush's second term. The headline-grabbing roundups of illegal workers slowed under the Obama administration, which has deported a record 2.5 million immigrants since 2009, largely by focusing on recent border crossers, employers who hired illegal workers and immigrants with criminal convictions.\par \par \uc2 But as President-elect \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  prepares to take office and promises to swiftly deport two million to three million undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, bipartisan experts say they expect a return of the raids that rounded up thousands of workers at carwashes, meatpacking plants, fruit suppliers and their homes during the Bush years.\par \par \uc2 ''If Trump seriously wants to step up dramatically the number of arrests, detentions and removals, I think he has to do workplace raids,'' said Michael J. Wishnie, a professor at Yale Law School who represents detainees in civil rights cases.\par \par \uc2 Since the election, Mr. Trump has suggested that he plans to focus on deporting criminals. ''What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,'' he told \uc2 CBS News\uc2  in November. ''We're getting them out of our country.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Trump's advisers have said that to promptly reach his target number of deportations, the definition of who is a criminal would need to be broadened. In July 2015, the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , a bipartisan think tank, estimated that of the roughly 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally, 820,000 had criminal records -- a definition Mr. Obama mostly adhered to during his second term, evicting some 530,000 immigrants convicted of crimes since 2013.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump would need to expand the basket to include immigrants living in the United States illegally who have been charged but not convicted of crimes, those who have overstayed visas, those who have committed minor misdemeanors like traffic infractions, and those suspected of being gang members or drug dealers.\par \par \uc2 Targeting workers for immigration-related offenses, such as using a forged or stolen Social Security number or driver's license, produced a significant uptick in deportations under Mr. Bush. But the practice was widely criticized for splitting up families, gutting businesses that relied on immigrant labor and taking aim at people who went to work every day, rather than dangerous criminals.\par \par \uc2 During Mr. Bush's second term, deportations increased to 360,000 from 246,000, while the number of immigrants convicted of crimes who were deported remained virtually stagnant, according to government statistics. And a 2007 report by the \uc2 National Council of La Raza\uc2  and the \uc2 Urban Institute\uc2  that analyzed work site raids in Massachusetts, Colorado and Nebraska said a majority of the children affected by the arrest and deportation of their parents were United States citizens and were infants, toddlers or preschoolers.\par \par \uc2 In 2009, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that federal identity-theft laws may not be used against illegal workers who used fake Social Security numbers to get jobs, unless those workers knowingly used numbers that belonged to real people.\par \par \uc2 ''This is the low-hanging fruit in the system: nondangerous undocumented immigrants with families,'' said John Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE under Mr. Obama. ''Those people don't hide. Criminals hide.''\par \par \uc2 Michael Chertoff, the Homeland Security secretary under Mr. Bush, defended workplace raids. He said these sweeps proved a potent way to protect workers by tamping down on the ''ecosystem of smuggling,'' which emboldens migrants to sneak into the country and empowers employers to hire them to work illegally, in unregulated and often inhumane conditions.\par \par \uc2 ''We found it to be effective in a targeted way,'' Mr. Chertoff said in an interview. ''We didn't willy-nilly stop at a workplace and raid it.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has not said specifically how he plans to deport several million undocumented immigrants, or if he plans to use work site raids. In an interview with Fox News during the campaign, Mr. Trump said he would draw on the approaches of Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, but ''with a lot more energy.''\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the incoming president, Jason Miller, said, ''We are inheriting the worst illegal immigration crisis in modern U.S. history and will need to develop a multifaceted approach to protect America's economic and national security.''\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for ICE, Sarah Rodriguez, said she could not speculate on what the incoming administration would do.\par \par \uc2 Work site raids became a cornerstone of Mr. Bush's second term and increased sharply after his efforts at an overhaul of the immigration system failed.\par \par \uc2 In a coordinated 2006 operation, federal immigration officials raided six \uc2 Swift & Company\uc2  meatpacking plants in several Midwestern states, leading to the arrest of an estimated 1,300 immigrant workers. Two years later, ICE officers stormed a kosher meat processing plant in Postville, Iowa, arresting 400 workers, or roughly 20 percent of the rural town's population.\par \par \uc2 Stories of ICE agents flooding a factory floor or restaurant kitchen, or following workers home to arrest them there, led to such fear of ''La Migra,'' the Spanish slang for American immigration officials, that they inspired a genre of Mexican ballads, known as ''migra corridos.''\par \par \uc2 Activists say the powerful scenes of ICE agents hauling off undocumented workers en masse could appeal to Mr. Trump, a former reality TV star who is savvy about media. In November, Mr. Trump earned widespread cable TV coverage -- and controversy -- for publicly pressuring a Carrier air-conditioner plant in Indianapolis to keep roughly 1,000 jobs from moving to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 ''If you want to do enforcement by creating images, this fits the bill,'' said \uc2 Muzaffar Chishti\uc2 , a lawyer and director of the Migration Policy Institute's \uc2 New York University\uc2  office.\par \par \uc2 But he added that the raids could also ''run counter to Trump's image for being an economic engine president,'' because the practice hurts business owners.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chertoff said that ideally, Congress would grant ''hard-working people'' a legal path to temporarily fill jobs in industries like meatpacking and agriculture, where labor shortages exist. ''Until that happens, the law is the law, and if you don't enforce the law, you end up incentivizing people to break it,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 By 2011, workplace raids had dropped by 70 percent since the final year of the Bush administration, and Republicans lawmakers implored Mr. Obama to return to the era of mass work site apprehensions.\par \par \uc2 Instead, Mr. Obama initiated a drastic increase in ''paper raids,'' or investigations into employers suspected of hiring illegal workers. Since January 2009, ICE has audited more than 8,900 employers and imposed more than $100.3 million in fines, according to government data. Mr. Obama also oversaw a spike in apprehensions at border crossings, which contributed to his administration's record number of deportations.\par \par \uc2 ''With Obama, we thought he was going to walk on water, and he threw us under the bus,'' said Frank Sharry, the founder and executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration group.\par \par \uc2 Work site raids became the subject of lawsuits claiming that immigration officials had violated constitutional protections against racial profiling and unreasonable searches.\par \par \uc2 Teresa Vara Gonzalez, 46, originally from Morelos, Mexico, had been in the United States for 26 years when ICE agents arrested her in 2007, part of the nationwide effort known as Operation Return to Sender.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Vara Gonzalez and other immigrants arrested in the New Haven area filed a lawsuit. ICE settled, without admission of wrongdoing, and the immigrants received cash payments and permission to remain in the country temporarily.\par \par \uc2 Now, Ms. Vara Gonzalez worries that she will be targeted again under Mr. Trump. ''He says even if we have papers he doesn't like us,'' she said on a break from her job at a taco truck painted with offerings such as tacos al pastor and lengua.\par \par \uc2 In May, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County in Arizona, an early supporter and adviser to Mr. Trump during his campaign, won a legal victory when a federal appeals court lifted a court order blocking Mr. Arpaio's use of workplace raids to enforce state laws that make it illegal for immigrants to use stolen identification to get a job. Still, his hard-line approach to the issue contributed to his being voted out of office in November.\par \par \uc2 In an interview, Mr. Arpaio declined to say whether he had advised the president-elect on his border and immigration policies, but said, ''There's a way to stop the problem, but you have to have the will of the president.'' He added, ''I'm optimistic.''\par \par \uc2 Teresa Vara Gonzalez works as a cook at a food truck in New Haven. She was detained in 2007 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers at her home and released after 12 days.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  published a profile last week of Richard B. Spencer, a prominent leader of the so-called alt-right, readers were quick to respond. By Monday, the article had drawn more than 2,600 comments.\par \par \uc2 Many of them had a similar message.\par \par \uc2 ''Please, please stop referring to a white Christian supremacist movement as the 'alt-right' -- a phrase that sounds like a subgenre of rock music,'' one reader wrote.\par \par \uc2 Another was more pointed: ''STOP CALLING THEM 'ALT-RIGHT.' THEY ARE RACISTS, WHITE SUPREMICISTS, NAZIS.''\par \par \uc2 With the election of \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  -- and his subsequent appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, a former chairman of the right-wing website Breitbart News, as his chief White House strategist -- the term alt-right has emerged as a linguistic flash point. Generally deployed by news organizations to describe a far-right, white nationalist movement known for its aggressive online expression, the term has attracted widespread criticism among those, particularly on the left, who say it euphemizes and legitimizes the ideologies of racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and white supremacy.\par \par \uc2 The alt-right was relatively unknown until last year, when the group's support for Mr. Trump elevated it into the national political debate. In August, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  denounced the movement in a speech that sought to link Mr. Trump with the alt-right's more extreme elements.\par \par \uc2 It was the selection of Mr. Bannon, who has called Breitbart ''the platform for the alt-right,'' that brought the term under fire. Now, prompted in part by the kind of condemnation evident in the comments on The Post article, news organizations are examining their use of the term.\par \par \uc2 Last Wednesday, The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  circulated style guidelines for several terms, including alt-right, which it defined in part as ''a small, far-right movement that seeks a whites-only state'' whose adherents are ''known for espousing racist, anti-Semitic and sexist points of view.''\par \par \uc2 And on Monday, The Associated Press published its own usage guidance for the term, saying that journalists should not use the term without defining it because ''it is not well known and the term may exist primarily as a public relations device to make its supporters' actual beliefs less clear and more acceptable to a broader audience.''\par \par \uc2 The standards editor at NPR published a memo in mid-November titled ''Guidance on References to the 'Alt-Right,''' that encouraged an explanation of the term, and the progressive news site ThinkProgress said in a post last week that it would ''no longer treat 'alt-right' as an accurate descriptor of either a movement or its members'' because the term is used as a self-descriptor and obscures the group's overt racism.\par \par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal has used the term, but a spokeswoman said in an email that it prefers to be ''more precise about groups or individuals, reporting on their specific actions or statements.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  has had many conversations about the term but has not banned it, said \uc2 Phil Corbett\uc2 , The Times's standards editor. Reporters are encouraged to explain what the term means rather than use it as a label, he said.\par \par \uc2 Defenders of the term argue that it is an appropriate characterization of a new group for which existing definitions do not capture the full range of ideologies and prejudices.\par \par \uc2 ''In the case of the alt-right, I think that the tendency has been to want to simply do away with the term and use the term 'white nationalist,' but I don't think that captures the stew of hate,'' said Nicole Hemmer, an assistant professor at the Miller Center at the \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2 , who studies conservatism and the media. Existing terms, including white nationalism, do not reflect the group's distinct history, media tactics or myriad hostilities, including its ''hard-core misogyny,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 She said news organizations should routinely define the meaning of alt-right so that readers understand the specific viewpoints it encompasses. ''We can't just use new words and new labels without describing what they are,'' she said. ''I think if news organizations are meticulous about defining their terms, then I think people will come to understand what the alt-right is.''\par \par \uc2 Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, a conservative magazine, said he was not opposed to using the term, either, if it was applied narrowly -- that is, to describe ''people who are obsessed with race and, in one form or another, are white supremacists.''\par \par \uc2 But he said it would be incorrect to use the label more broadly to describe others on the conservative spectrum, such as the populist and nationalist wing of the Republican Party. ''From where we sit, the alt-right is kind of a motley collection of white supremacists and neo-Nazis,'' he said. ''It's a mistake to label people who aren't that the alt-right.''\par \par \uc2 News organizations have often contended with the issue of terminology used to describe certain groups, viewpoints or ideologies, particularly when they carry political implications.\par \par \uc2 ''Journalists and other people in political life are always arguing about the naming of things,'' said \uc2 Roy Peter Clark\uc2 , a senior scholar at \uc2 the Poynter Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the past, the terms ''pro-choice'' and ''pro-life,'' to identify people who either support or oppose abortion rights, have both generated backlash, as have the terms ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' and ''undocumented worker'' to describe foreigners who are in the country without legal documentation.\par \par \uc2 News organizations have also grappled with the word ''torture'' to describe the C.I.A.'s interrogation techniques. For years, The Times avoided using the word to avoid taking sides in a legal and political fight.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, wrote in a post on the newspaper's website that The Times had recalibrated its language and would henceforth use the word torture to ''describe incidents in which we know for sure that interrogators inflicted pain on a prisoner in an effort to get information.''\par \par \uc2 Social media platforms like \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  have increased the intensity of debates over language and broadened their audience. That could prompt news organizations to more quickly examine the words they use, said Joshua Benton, the director of the Nieman Journalism Lab.\par \par \uc2 ''Journalists who are on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  are seeing the negative reaction to a word choice, a headline choice, whatever it may be,'' he said, adding that he expected to see more rapid action from news organizations in response to such criticism.\par \par \uc2 But while it is inevitable that certain terms, especially ones that may be politically charged, will provoke some level of debate, the solution, many journalists say, is to describe rather than label.\par \par \uc2 Parsing a term heavy with connotations is ''hard work'' said Cameron Barr, a managing editor at The Washington Post. But he added: ''It's incumbent upon us to provide clear and dispassionate definitions of what these things mean.''\par \par \uc2 The ''alt-right'' backed Donald J. Trump, putting it in the spotlight.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In a remarkable statement that seemed to cast doubt on American democracy, \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  said Wednesday that he might not accept the results of next month's election if he felt it was rigged against him -- a stand that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  blasted as ''horrifying'' at their final and caustic debate on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump, under enormous pressure to halt Mrs. Clinton's steady rise in opinion polls, came across as repeatedly frustrated as he tried to rally conservative voters with hard-line stands on illegal immigration and abortion rights. But he kept finding himself drawn onto perilous political territory by Mrs. Clinton and the debate's moderator, Chris Wallace.\par \par \uc2 He sputtered when Mrs. Clinton charged that he would be ''a puppet'' of President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia if elected. He lashed out repeatedly, saying that ''she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways'' and that ''she's guilty of a very, very serious crime'' over her State Department email practices. And by the end of the debate, when Mrs. Clinton needled him over Social Security, Mr. Trump snapped and said, ''Such a nasty woman.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton was repeatedly forced to defend her long service in government, which Mr. Trump charged had yielded no real accomplishments. But she was rarely rattled, and made a determined effort to rise above Mr. Trump's taunts while making overtures to undecided voters.\par \par \uc2 She particularly sought to appeal to Republicans and independents who have doubts about Mr. Trump, arguing that she was not an opponent of the Second Amendment as he claimed, and promising to be tougher and shrewder on national security than Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 But it was Mr. Trump's remark about the election results that stood out, even in a race that has been full of astonishing moments.\par \par \uc2 Every losing presidential candidate in modern times has accepted the will of the voters, even in extraordinarily close races, such as when John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Richard M. Nixon in 1960 and George W. Bush beat Al Gore in Florida to win the presidency in 2000.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump insisted, without offering evidence, that the general election has been rigged against him, and he twice refused to say that he would accept its result.\par \par \uc2 ''I will look at it at the time,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I will keep you in suspense.''\par \par \uc2 ''That's horrifying,'' Mrs. Clinton replied. ''Let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating -- he is talking down our democracy. And I am appalled that someone who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that position.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton then ticked off the number of times he had deemed a system rigged when he suffered a setback, noting he had even called the Emmy Awards fixed when his show, ''The Apprentice,'' was passed over.\par \par \uc2 ''It's funny, but it's also really troubling,'' she said. ''That is not the way our democracy works.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton also accused Mr. Trump of extreme coziness with Mr. Putin, criticizing him for failing to condemn Russian espionage against her campaign's internal email.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Trump responded that Mr. Putin had ''no respect'' for Mrs. Clinton, she shot back, in one of the toughest lines of the night: ''That's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.''\par \par \uc2 ''No puppet, no puppet,'' Mr. Trump sputtered. ''You're the puppet.'' He quickly recovered and said, ''She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government, whatsoever.''\par \par \uc2 With 20 days left before Election Day and early voting already underway in Florida, Ohio and several other key states, the debate felt less like an argument between equals than a last-ditch attempt by a fading candidate, Mr. Trump, to save himself.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump sought throughout the debate to recover from a politically damaging three weeks. He has been unable to gain traction in the polls from his strategy of assailing the Clintons as corrupt and immoral; the news media as biased and bent on rigging the election against him; and the nine women who have come forward to accuse him of unwanted sexual advances as liars and, in some cases, unattractive.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump said, in response to a question from the debate moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, that the claims of the women had been ''debunked'' and that they had been put forward by Mrs. Clinton's campaign.\par \par \uc2 But after he denied ridiculing the looks of the women accusing him of sexual harassment -- ''I did not say that,'' he repeated three times -- Mrs. Clinton repeated nearly verbatim his two comments from last week about the appearances of a pair of his accusers.\par \par \uc2 ''Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,'' she said. ''He goes after their dignity, their self-worth; and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.''\par \par \uc2 After Mrs. Clinton finished an extended condemnation, Mr. Trump said only: ''Nobody has more respect for women than I do, nobody.''\par \par \uc2 In contrast to their two previous debates, the 90-minute discussion covered significant substantive ground. On immigration, Mr. Trump argued that Mrs. Clinton wanted to give illegal immigrants ''amnesty'' and that ''she wants to have open borders.''\par \par \uc2 ''We have to have strong borders, we have to keep the drugs out of our country -- right now we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash,'' he added. ''We have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton recalled meeting a young girl in Las Vegas whose parents had been threatened, and noted that Mr. Trump has said that every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  would ultimately be subject to deportation.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want to rip families apart,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.''\par \par \uc2 At several points, Mrs. Clinton tried to bait Mr. Trump into an outburst, such as when she said that he ''choked'' during his meeting this summer with the president of Mexico when he did not press him on Mexico paying to build a border wall.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Trump pivoted to attack former President Bill Clinton's administration for supporting the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  and assailed Mrs. Clinton for her past comments supporting ''open borders'' in the Western Hemisphere.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump also called the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2  ''a criminal enterprise.'' Mrs. Clinton returned fire by ridiculing Mr. Trump's foundation, which she noted purchased ''a six-foot portrait of Donald.''\par \par \uc2 ''I mean, who does that?'' she asked.\par \par \uc2 The two candidates also tangled over abortion rights. After initially declining to flatly say whether he would support overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, Mr. Trump conceded that the justices he would appoint to the court would do just that.\par \par \uc2 ''If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that's really what will happen,'' he said. ''That'll happen automatically in my opinion.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton responded with a full-throated defense of Roe and abortion rights.\par \par \uc2 ''The government has no business in the decisions that women make,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump retorted, ''If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton appeared visibly angry. ''You should meet with some of the women I've met with,'' she said, accusing him of using ''scare rhetoric.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton used the opening question about the Supreme Court to make a broad appeal to voters to consider the future of the United States under her presidency or a Trump administration. ''What kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities are we going to provide for our citizens, what kind of rights will Americans have?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump asserted that if Mrs. Clinton won, the Second Amendment would become ''a very, very small replica of what we have now.'' He also said he would appoint justices who ''will interpret the Constitution the way the founders want it interpreted.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton quickly tried to undercut Mr. Trump on guns.\par \par \uc2 ''I support the Second Amendment,'' she said, noting that she had lived in Arkansas and represented upstate New York where many gun owners lived. ''When I think about what I need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks'' and to close loopholes that make it easier for Americans to buy guns.\par \par \uc2 On the economy, Mrs. Clinton described Mr. Trump as a hypocrite, accusing him of crying ''crocodile tears'' over manufacturers moving abroad while noting that he uses foreign steel for his hotel in Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 That prompted a ferocious counterattack from Mr. Trump, demanding why she had not done more to improve the economy during her years in public life.\par \par \uc2 ''Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15 or 20 years,'' he demanded, adding: ''The one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton, clearly prepared for him to return to this line of attack, responded with a carefully prepared salvo.\par \par \uc2 She compared what the two of them had been doing since the 1970s, highlighting her public service accomplishments and ridiculing him for borrowing money from his father, mocking a beauty queen as ''an eating machine'' and hosting a reality television show.\par \par \uc2 ''On the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting ''The Celebrity Apprentice,''' Mrs. Clinton said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump defended himself by boasting about his business success and said the country would be well served if it was run in the fashion of his company.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton, reaching for not just a win but a mandate, made both direct and more subtle appeals to Republican voters. She noted that in the 1980s Mr. Trump had criticized Ronald Reagan over his stewardship, twice invoking the name of the late president revered by so many Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Remarkably, Mr. Trump demanded additional time to speak so he could note that he did, in fact, disagree with Reagan over trade. Mrs. Clinton, in that moment, came off as more respectful to Republican history.\par \par \uc2 ''I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents,'' she said, ''because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc34}{\*\bkmkend toc34}\b \uc2 Johnson's Challenges Go Beyond 'What Is Aleppo?' Flub\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALAN RAPPEPORT \par \uc2 1,107 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When he accepted the Libertarian Party's nomination in May, \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2  told delegates that he was ready to peel away votes from the Republican and Democratic candidates, potentially catapulting a party on the fringe of American politics onto the presidential debate stage and, with luck, to the White House.\par \par \uc2 But nearly four months later, Mr. Johnson's presidential chances appear shaky. The former Republican governor of New Mexico is polling around 10 percent nationally, healthy for a third-party candidate, but below the 15 percent threshold required to be included in presidential debates.\par \par \uc2 And on Thursday, Mr. Johnson's credibility suffered a blow when he fumbled over a question about the crisis in Syria, asking an MSNBC commentator, ''What is Aleppo?''\par \par \uc2 The challenges facing Mr. Johnson's bid go beyond a mental short-circuit and reflect the deeply entrenched obstacles that third-party and independent candidates face when running for president.\par \par \uc2 On the surface, the low approval ratings for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  present a prime opportunity for a candidate like Mr. Johnson, who is socially liberal and fiscally conservative. Even so, that intriguing blend of policies has made it difficult for the Libertarian ticket, which includes William F. Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, to attract stray Democrats or disenchanted Republicans in large numbers.\par \par \uc2 ''He's had issues coalescing the anti-Trump Republican crowd, partially because it's a mix of social conservatives and moderates, and partly because at times he's seemed more keen on appealing to the Bernie bros,'' said Tim Miller, a Republican and a former aide to Jeb Bush, referring to the supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Miller opposes Mr. Trump and is considering voting for the Libertarian ticket this year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Miller added that Mr. Johnson's flub about Aleppo did not make him a riskier bet on foreign policy matters than is Mr. Trump. But, he said, it does highlight the problem that many Republicans have with Libertarians. ''It reinforces my top policy difference with him, which is his relative isolationism'' on foreign affairs, he said.\par \par \uc2 While prominent Republicans often speak highly of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Weld, few big names have come forward to formally endorse him. Mr. Johnson drew criticism from some Republicans last week when he took issue with the expression ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ,'' and his views on fully legalizing marijuana remain out of step with mainstream politics.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Johnson's supporters have expressed hope that anti-Trump sentiment could help propel the Libertarians this year.\par \par \uc2 On social media, many of Mr. Johnson's backers say they hope that Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who has had a public feud with Mr. Trump, might get behind the Libertarian ticket, but so far they have had no luck converting him.\par \par \uc2 In June, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska expressed interest in the Libertarian Party, but later said that Mr. Johnson's positions on abortion, religious liberty and national security were deal breakers.\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , the 2012 Republican nominee who has showered praise on Mr. Weld, pushed publicly this week for the Libertarians to be allowed in the debates. Still, he has given no sign that he will back the party's ticket in November, even though he has said he will not vote for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton.\par \par \uc2 ''The Libertarians just break too much from traditional G.O.P. orthodoxy on foreign policy and social issues to get a big amount of Republican support,'' said Kyle D. Kondik of the Center for Politics at the \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Democratic electorate has also failed to provide fertile ground for the Libertarians, despite the lingering disappointment among some who supported Mr. Sanders. Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, has drawn some Sanders backers, and Mr. Johnson's position in favor of free trade is out of step with most Democrats these days.\par \par \uc2 Political analysts point to a variety of reasons third-party candidacies tend to flounder in the United States. A lack of exposure in the news media is often cited, as are political science theories that argue that in a winner-take-all political system, voters gravitate to two mainstream parties out of fear that they would otherwise be wasting their votes.\par \par \uc2 Many see the debates as the biggest obstacle for third-party candidates. The \uc2 Commission on Presidential Debates\uc2  requires that candidates invited to the three nationally televised presidential debates have an average of at least 15 percent support in five specific national polls.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson has said that he has no chance of winning the election without debating Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, and his supporters argue that the poll threshold is arbitrary and too high.\par \par \uc2 ''In the real world, that's just impossible,'' said Richard Winger, an expert on third-party candidates and the editor of Ballot Access News. ''That's a real barrier.''\par \par \uc2 Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist who has worked with Mr. Romney and Mr. Weld, said that difficulties raising money for campaign infrastructure and advertising put the Libertarians at a distinct disadvantage in reaching voters who might gravitate to their message.\par \par \uc2 ''Most people don't know who \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2  is,'' said Mr. Stevens, adding that he remained open to voting for the candidate despite his slim chances. ''He doesn't have much of an apparatus to push him.''\par \par \uc2 Despite the hurdles, Mr. Johnson could still have a major effect on the race.\par \par \uc2 Polls show him appealing to young, educated voters in states like North Carolina who might otherwise support Mrs. Clinton, and disaffected conservatives in places like Utah, where much of the traditionally Republican Mormon population is turned off by Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 In a close election, a Libertarian ticket that is drawing one-tenth of the vote could reshape the electoral map and tilt battlegrounds in unpredictable directions.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Quinnipiac University\uc2  survey released on Thursday showed Mr. Johnson pulling a big chunk of the vote in Ohio, highlighting the influence that he might have.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2  could decide the presidential election in the Buckeye State,'' said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll. ''He is getting 14 percent from Ohio voters, and how that cohort eventually votes could be critical in this swing state -- and in the nation.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, is below the polling threshold required to be included in presidential debates.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Following is a transcript of the remarks by \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  on immigration in Phoenix on Wednesday, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wow. Thank you. That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 The state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Now, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also? So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight. We're going to Arizona, O.K.?\par \par \uc2 This will be a little bit different. This won't be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the president of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.\par \par \uc2 And, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we're all going to win. Both countries, we're all going to win.\par \par \uc2 This is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly. Sadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them. The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.\par \par \uc2 Today, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Let me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank you. But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it's impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.\par \par \uc2 These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out. It's our right, as a sovereign nation, to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Then there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.\par \par \uc2 Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.\par \par \uc2 He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.\par \par \uc2 Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open-border policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant.\par \par \uc2 He was murdered by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.\par \par \uc2 Another victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.\par \par \uc2 In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.\par \par \uc2 A 2011 report from the \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.\par \par \uc2 On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.\par \par \uc2 While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.\par \par \uc2 And they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.\par \par \uc2 But these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.\par \par \uc2 Not going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!\par \par \uc2 The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be three million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.\par \par \uc2 Frankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 But whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Only the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.\par \par \uc2 To all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Nothing even comes a close second. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.\par \par \uc2 No, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.\par \par \uc2 We will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 President Obama and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.\par \par \uc2 President Obama and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. They support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.\par \par \uc2 On top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.\par \par \uc2 Most incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan horse. Watch what's going to happen, folks. It's not going to be pretty.\par \par \uc2 This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Hard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you've heard about \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan. And do you notice...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire. It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.\par \par \uc2 I also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.\par \par \uc2 Number one, are you ready? Are you ready?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We will build a great wall along the southern border.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 AUDIENCE: Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!\par \par \uc2 And Mexico will pay for the wall.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 One hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall.\par \par \uc2 On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Above and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Number two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And they'll be brought great distances. We're not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back. And across.\par \par \uc2 Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, O.K.?\par \par \uc2 Number three. Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great. It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Zero. They don't come in here. They don't come in here.\par \par \uc2 According to federal data, there are at least two million, two million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, two million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Now, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.\par \par \uc2 They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the two million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 They're going out. They're going out fast.\par \par \uc2 Moving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.\par \par \uc2 We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.\par \par \uc2 That's over. That's over, folks. That's over.\par \par \uc2 Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.\par \par \uc2 My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.\par \par \uc2 Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.\par \par \uc2 This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.\par \par \uc2 On my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And then we get them out.\par \par \uc2 Another reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They're going to go.\par \par \uc2 We're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has evaded justice, O.K.?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Maybe they'll be able to deport her.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 The local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore.\par \par \uc2 There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and now finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.\par \par \uc2 We're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Who gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.\par \par \uc2 And put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.\par \par \uc2 I've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.\par \par \uc2 Number four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities. Number five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.\par \par \uc2 (BOOING)\par \par \uc2 And how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2 . Great.\par \par \uc2 Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.\par \par \uc2 And don't forget the \uc2 Supreme Court of the United States\uc2 . Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment. And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets. They have been forgotten.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Clinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.\par \par \uc2 (BOOING)\par \par \uc2 Can you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.\par \par \uc2 Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Number six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 According to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.\par \par \uc2 Our country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.\par \par \uc2 The number is likely higher. But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress. As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , brutalized.\par \par \uc2 (BOOING)\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.\par \par \uc2 I call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good. It's extreme.\par \par \uc2 And if people don't like it, we've got have a country folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria. We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. It's going to end badly folks. It's going to end very, very badly.\par \par \uc2 For the price of resettling one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states. We don't want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.\par \par \uc2 But we will get the money from Gulf states and others. We'll supervise it. We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.\par \par \uc2 Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people. And we will get the right people. An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank you. We're very proud of our country. Aren't we? Really? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That's what they say.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 That's what they say. They're justified. Right? And we're admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our president refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Number seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back. So we say, O.K., we'll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the secretary of state to stop issuing visas to these countries.\par \par \uc2 Secretary \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And, they would comply if we would act properly.\par \par \uc2 In other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.\par \par \uc2 The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.\par \par \uc2 According to a report for the \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2  from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.\par \par \uc2 We're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.\par \par \uc2 These 13,000 releases occurred on \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.\par \par \uc2 (BOOING)\par \par \uc2 And Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2  writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them, we take them.\par \par \uc2 (BOOING)\par \par \uc2 Number eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision. You ever notice?\par \par \uc2 In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.\par \par \uc2 Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should they? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.\par \par \uc2 Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose -- and they really are a big problem -- pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States on expired visas.\par \par \uc2 And you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant.\par \par \uc2 Last year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.\par \par \uc2 We must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.\par \par \uc2 Number nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\par \par \uc2 Immigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.\par \par \uc2 That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.\par \par \uc2 Tremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Number 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We're going to take care of our workers.\par \par \uc2 And by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to bring our jobs back home. We're going to bring our jobs back home.\par \par \uc2 We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with Nafta. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.\par \par \uc2 We're going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them. It's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen. There will be consequences.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.\par \par \uc2 We've had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.\par \par \uc2 To keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms. To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We take anybody. Come on in, anybody. Just come on in. Not anymore.\par \par \uc2 You know, folks, it's called a two-way street. It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a Trump administration it's called America first. Remember that.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 To choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African-American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is going to do nothing for the African-American worker, the Latino worker. She's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November 8th. And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years. That's what it is.\par \par \uc2 She is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She's done nothing. She's been there for 35 years. She's done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we're going to do together. Watch.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 You watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old.\par \par \uc2 To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They're archaic. They're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?\par \par \uc2 So let's now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump.\par \par \uc2 I will get this done for you and for your family. We'll do it right. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.\par \par \uc2 And the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.\par \par \uc2 For those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry --\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Thank you. Thank you. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.TRUMP: We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Our message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can't do it.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Importantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.\par \par \uc2 That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Right now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.\par \par \uc2 Whether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing. And the media needs to begin demanding to hear \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 These are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . And do you notice, she doesn't answer.\par \par \uc2 She didn't go to Louisiana. She didn't go to Mexico. She was invited.\par \par \uc2 She doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 What we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . You won't like what you're hearing.\par \par \uc2 The result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.\par \par \uc2 This election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. November 8. November 8. You got to get out and vote on November 8.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 It's our last chance. It's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that. So I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.\par \par \uc2 I am going to ask -- these are really special people that I've gotten to know. I'm going to ask all of the ''Angel Moms'' to come join me on the stage right now.\par \par \uc2 These are amazing women.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 These are amazing people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!\par \par \uc2 I've become friends with so many. But Jamiel Shaw, incredible guy, lost his son so violently. Say just a few words about your child.\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): My son Ronald da Silva (ph) was murdered April 27, 2002 by an illegal alien who had been previously deported. And what so -- makes me so outrageous is that we came here legally.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Mr. Trump. I totally support you. You have my vote.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you, thank you.\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): God bless you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know what? Name your child and come right by. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): Laura Wilkerson. And my son was Joshua Wilkerson. He was murdered by an illegal in 2010. And I personally support Mr. Trump for our next president.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): My name is Ruth Johnston Martin (ph). My husband was shot by an illegal alien. He fought the good fight but he took his last breath in 2002. And I support this man who's going to change this country for the better. God bless you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): My name Maureen Maloney (ph), and our son Matthew Denise (ph) was 23 years old when he was dragged a quarter of a mile to his death by an illegal alien, while horrified witnesses were banging on the truck trying to stop him.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): Our son Matthew Denise, if \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  were president in 2011, our son Matthew Denise and other Americans would be alive today.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): Thank you. My name is Kathy Woods (ph). My son Steve (ph), a high school senior, 17 years old, went to the beach after a high school football game. A local gang came along, nine members. The cars were battered to -- like war in Beirut. And all I can say is they murdered him and if Mr. Trump had been in office then the border would have been secure and our children would not be dead today.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): Hi. My name is Brenda Sparks (ph), and my son is named Eric Zapeda (ph). He was raised by a legal immigrant from Honduras only to be murdered by an illegal in 2011. His murderer never did a second in handcuffs or jail. Got away with killing an American. So I'm voting for trump. And by the way, so is my mother.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): My name is Dee Angle (ph). My cousin Rebecca Ann Johnston (ph), known as Becky, was murdered on January the 1st, 1989 in North Little Rock, Arkansas. Thank you. And if you don't vote Trump, we won't have a country. Trump all the way.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): I'm Shannon Estes (ph). And my daughter Shaley Estes (ph), 22 years old, was murdered here in Phoenix last July 24 by a Russian who overstayed his visa. And vote Trump.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): I'm Mary Ann Mendoza, the mother of Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, who was killed in a violent head-on collision in Mesa.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 I want to thank Phoenix for the support you've always given me, and I want to tell you what. I'm supporting the man who will -- who is the only man who is going to save our country, and what we our going to be leaving our children.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (SPEAKER'S VOICE): I'm Steve Ronnebeck, father of Grant Ronnebeck, 21 years old. Killed January 22, 2015 by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who shot him in the face. I truly believe that Mr. Trump is going to change things. He's going to fight for my family, and he's going to fight for America.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: These are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that. I just think I've gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group. But they are incredible people and what they're going through is incredible, and there's just no reason for it. Let's give them a really tremendous hand.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 That's tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people.\par \par \uc2 So, now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.\par \par \uc2 Let's fix this horrible, horrible, problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let's our secure our border.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Let's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. Let's protect our social security and Medicare. Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.\par \par \uc2 This has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. November 8, we have to get everybody. This is such an important state. November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.\par \par \uc2 We're going to bring -- thank you, thank you. We're going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We're going to take our country back.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 This is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven't been looking to what's been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking. You should start looking.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Together we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. Together we can save America itself. Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.\par \par \uc2 Thank you. I love you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc36}{\*\bkmkend toc36}\b \uc2 After Confusion, Trump Tries to Clarify Immigration Plan\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 791 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 DES MOINES -- \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  provided on Saturday a more detailed look at his immigration policy, returning to the issue after a week in which he faced criticism from across the political spectrum for seeming to soften his hard-line position on deporting undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In a speech at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, Mr. Trump said he would strengthen the system that allows employers to verify the eligibility of workers, and would create an entry-exit tracking system for visas. He also reiterated his promise to cancel ''unconstitutional orders'' and ''executive orders'' relating to immigration.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Trump largely avoided the question that has caused him trouble this week: what to do about the undocumented immigrants already in the country.\par \par \uc2 ''All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million people, or more, or less -- they have no idea what the number is because we have no control over our country, have no idea what it is, that are here illegally,'' Mr. Trump said.\par \par \uc2 His proposals on the employment verification system, known as E-Verify, and on visa tracking, which he said would ''ensure those who overstay their visas are quickly removed,'' are in line with the approaches put forward by many Republicans, including Jeb Bush and \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey, two of Mr. Trump's chief rivals in the Republican primary race, and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , the party's nominee in 2012. They were also central to legislation proposed by a bipartisan group of senators in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump maintained his hard-line approach to undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes, promising that ''on Day 1, I am going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country.'' He said he would always ''err on the side of protecting the American people'' when it came to removing such immigrants.\par \par \uc2 To help illustrate his point, Mr. Trump invited the family of Sarah Root, a young Iowa woman killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in a drunken-driving accident, to give brief remarks.\par \par \uc2 The comments on Saturday came after Mr. Trump and his campaign faced a backlash from some of his most fervent supporters, who expressed anger and confusion after he told the Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday that he would be open to ''softening'' on immigration, indicating he might let some undocumented immigrants remain in the country legally, though not as citizens.\par \par \uc2 ''No citizenship,'' Mr. Trump said. ''They'll pay back taxes. They have to pay taxes,'' he added. ''There's no amnesty, but we will work with them.''\par \par \uc2 He sought to clear that up on Thursday in an interview with \uc2 CNN\uc2 's Anderson Cooper.\par \par \uc2 ''There's no path to legalization unless they leave the country,'' Mr. Trump said in the interview. ''When they come back in, then they can start paying taxes, but there is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and then come back.''\par \par \uc2 But he still declined to clarify whether he would forcibly deport the undocumented immigrants who have been in the country and not committed a crime, something he had promised during his primary campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump also used the event here, sponsored by Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, to discuss his agricultural policy. Ms. Ernst, a freshman senator who was considered a possible vice-presidential candidate for Mr. Trump, argued that he would keep the country safe. Senator \uc2 Charles E. Grassley\uc2 , the state's senior senator, noted the importance of the Supreme Court vacancy.\par \par \uc2 In his remarks, Mr. Trump also brought up the shooting death of a cousin of the N.B.A. star \uc2 Dwyane Wade\uc2 , which he had cited earlier in the day on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , as evidence that he was right about the plight of African-Americans.\par \par \uc2 This time, Mr. Trump's remarks were more tempered, and he offered prayers and condolences rather than saying, as he had earlier: ''Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!''\par \par \uc2 ''Just yesterday, the cousin of N.B.A. star \uc2 Dwyane Wade\uc2  -- a great guy, \uc2 Dwyane Wade\uc2  -- was the victim of a tragic shooting in Chicago,'' Mr. Trump said. ''She was the mother of four and was killed while pushing her infant child in a stroller just walking down the street. Shot. It breaks all of our hearts to see it.''\par \par \uc2 He continued: ''This shouldn't happen in our country; this shouldn't happen in America. So we send our thoughts and prayers to the family, and we also promise to fight for a much, much better tomorrow.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160828ec8s0006p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Trump\uc2 's acceptance speech here was filled with Trump-like hyperbole and the kind of vague political rhetoric that is hard to pin down.\par \par \uc2 But there were also facts.\par \par \uc2 In describing the problems that he would seek to fix from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump offered a series of grim facts about crime, the economy, and foreign policy. ''Here at our convention, there will be no lies,'' Mr. Trump said.\par \par \uc2 Many of Mr. Trump's facts appear to be true, though the Republican presidential nominee sometimes failed to offer the entire story, or provide all of the context that might help to explain his numbers.\par \par \uc2 And in some cases, the facts seemed inflated or misleading, part of a broader ideological message that Mr. Trump was hoping to convey.\par \par \uc2 Here are our fact-checks of some of his claims:\par \par \uc2 ''Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: Those statistics are based on one analysis of preliminary crime data released by the Justice Department, and they accurately reflect what officials say is a spike in murders in some big cities. It leaves out the drop in others, like New York City, which saw a 25 percent drop in homicides in the first three months of 2016.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: Those statistics are based on an analysis performed by The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , which found no clear pattern in which cities saw increases in homicides.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''In the president's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: This is largely true. The \uc2 Chicago police department\uc2  reports 2,242 shootings so far in 2016. And while it is unclear exactly what Mr. Trump means by ''the Chicago area,'' that figure appears to track with reported murders since the start of 2009.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: In fact, the Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks officer deaths, reports that 68 police officers have been killed so far this year, almost exactly the same as the 69 who were killed in the same period last year.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: Those numbers come from a report by the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , which told Congress late last year that nearly 1 million undocumented immigrants have been ordered deported but remain in the country. Mr. Trump did not mention that most of those 180,000 are likely people charged with nonviolent crimes.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''The number of new \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: This is true, according to reports from the Border Patrol, which said that more than 51,000 families have been apprehended on the border in the first nine months of the fiscal year, compared to about 40,000 last fiscal year. But that is still less than 2014, when a surge of families across the border caused a political stir.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''Nearly four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58 percent of African-American youth are not employed.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: According to the \uc2 Bureau of Labor Statistics\uc2 , the unemployment rate of African Americans ages 16-19 in June was 31.2 percent (among whites of the same age, it was 14.1 percent).\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: This is mostly true. Median household income in 2000 was $57,724; in 2014, which has the most recent available data, it was $53,657.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''Our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an all-time high -- nearly $800 billion in a single year.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: The goods deficit -- more imported goods, less exported goods -- was $763 billion last year. But that includes agricultural products and raw materials like coal. Moreover, the total trade deficit last year was only $500 billion because the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: The national debt was $10.6 trillion on the day Obama took office. It was $19.2 trillion in April, so not quite double, but close.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''Forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: As of October, this figure was largely accurate, according to the \uc2 United States Department of Agriculture\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was cooperating. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing and, really, a big, big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was under control.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: Mr. Trump is mostly right. But Libya, Syria and Egypt were swept up in the Arab Spring, an uprising out of Mrs. Clinton's and Mr. Obama's control. And the sanctions on Iran were just getting ramped up at that time; they became far tougher under the Obama administration than they were during the Bush administration. That helped force Tehran to the negotiating table for last year's deal.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing -- it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: The deal does not directly give Iran money, but by easing or terminating sanctions, it would allow Iran to have access to many billions of dollars of its own money that has been frozen in overseas accounts. And the exact value of those sanctions is debatable.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under the leadership of President Obama.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: This is true, as Mrs. Clinton said in September she wanted to ''move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000.'' But she also said she would improve the already extensive vetting process, especially from Syria.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160722ec7m0004r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

SHEAR and NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 968 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Night 4 of the Republican National Convention was \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2 's night: He was introduced after a speech by his daughter Ivanka. Mr. Trump's speech -- and the balloons that follow his acceptance of the Republican nomination -- kicked off the final phase in his quest for the presidency.\par \par \uc2 Some of the highlights of the night:\par \par \uc2 Here's a taste from our main story on Mr. Trump's speech (and check out what we fact checked in it):\par \par \uc2 With dark imagery and an almost angry tone, Mr. Trump portrayed the United States as a diminished and even humiliated nation, and offered himself as an all-powerful savior who could resurrect the country's standing in the eyes of both enemies and law-abiding Americans.\par \par \uc2 Ivanka Trump\uc2  offered a softer, less harsh portrait of her father in a speech introducing him. She said that as a daughter and an employee of the \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2 , she ''witnessed his empathy and generosity.'' She said Mr. Trump is ''color-blind and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period.''\par \par \uc2 And she pledged that Mr. Trump will fight for ''equal pay for equal work,'' noting that at Mr. Trump's company, there are ''more female than male executives'' and that ''when a woman becomes a mother, she is supported, not shut out.'' Her father, she promised, will be ''your greatest, your truest and your most loyal champion.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican.'' \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2 , the billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist and entrepreneur, took the Republican Party to task over what he called ''fake culture wars.'' He recalled that when he was a kid, the great debate was defeating the Soviet Union, but ''now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom.'' Focusing on these debates, he said, ''distract us from our economic decline, and nobody in this race is being honest about it except \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: Among Mr. Thiel's claims was that ''our government is broken. Our nuclear bases still use floppy disks.'' That, in fact, is true, according to a report by the General Accounting Office this year. According to the report: ''Department of Defense uses 8-inch floppy disks in a legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nation's nuclear forces.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Jerry Falwell Jr\uc2 ., the evangelical leader of the top Christian university, made both a faith-based and populist case for Mr. Trump, calling him a ''blue-collar billionaire'' who he has known for over 20 years.\par \par \uc2 His evangelical argument for Mr. Trump centered on a plank in the platform to repeal a tax law banning churches from political organizing, as well as a pledge to appoint ''conservative, pro-life justices'' to the Supreme Court. And he included perhaps a thinly veiled message to Senator Ted Cruz, who spoke last night and declined to endorse Mr. Trump: ''If you are a conservative, a decision not to vote or to vote for a third candidate is a de facto vote for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 With the playful tone of a wedding toast, \uc2 Tom Barrack\uc2 , a billionaire businessman and longtime friend of Mr. Trump, used most of his speech to share stories and memories. He told the crowd that he had ''nothing negative to say about Hillary'' and ''only amazing things to tell you about Donald.'' His personal anecdotes revealed a more-or-less unseen side of the Mr. Trump that few other speakers touched on during the convention.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Joe Arpaio's support for Mr. Trump might be boiled down to this: You had me at \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Mr. Arpaio is the Arizona sheriff who became famous for his aggressive, anti-immigrant tactics in that state. And Mr. Trump started his campaign more than a year ago by focusing on the danger that illegal immigrants pose to Americans. On Thursday, Mr. Arpaio said his experience at the border convinced him that ''we have terrorists coming over our borders, infiltrating our communities and causing massive destruction and mayhem.'' He said Mr. Trump was the only candidate willing to confront that issue.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee struck a mostly optimistic note amid remarks that focused on problems. She proclaimed that electing Mr. Trump would return the country to greatness and spoke broadly about Mr. Trump's leadership qualities and record as a businessman who ''has seen challenges'' and ''learned his lessons.'' And with a turn of phrase, linked his real estate successes to the potential of a Trump presidency: ''Not only can they change a skyline, they can change the world.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Mary Fallin\uc2 , the governor of Oklahoma, re-engaged the pattern of pessimism, but she said that Mr. Trump is the one to provide optimism -- even if some Republicans might not agree with everything he says. ''As Ronald Reagan said, 'the person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and ally,' '' she said.\par \par \uc2 Reince Preibus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, hammered Mrs. Clinton for a lack of personal and professional ethics. She ''lied over and over and over and over'' about her email server, he said. ''Perhaps worst of all, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has perfected the art of politics for personal gain. She reads ethics rules as carefully as Americans read their junk mail.'' He accused Mrs. Clinton of using her position as secretary of state to ''grease the wheels for Democrat lobbyists, special interests and political insiders connected to the corrupt Clinton machine.'' With Mr. Trump, he said, ''help is coming.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160722ec7m00058\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECT\par {\*\bkmkstart toc39}{\*\bkmkend toc39}\b \uc2 Just How Bad an Election Night Was It for California Republicans?\b0\par\par\uc2 By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JENNIFER MEDINA \par \uc2 1,324 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES -- The primary Tuesday in California handed victories to \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  on the Republican side and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  on the Democratic side. But it was also a reminder of what bad shape the state's Republican Party is in. No Republican drew enough votes to qualify for the runoff for an open \uc2 United States Senate\uc2  seat this fall; the contest will feature only Democratic candidates.\par \par \uc2 A collection of Wednesday morning headlines hit the same theme: The Republican Party had crashed and burned in California and had done little to address its long-running problems attracting voters in the largest-growing demographic: Latinos. \uc2 Adam Nagourney\uc2 , the Los Angeles bureau chief for The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , and Jennifer Medina, a correspondent in the bureau, talked about the results and what they mean for a beleaguered party in the country' s most populous state.\par \par \uc2 ADAM NAGOURNEY\uc2 : Jenny. So, it might have gotten overlooked in the late-breaking Democratic presidential contest here (why, oh why, does it take California so long to count votes?), but this was not a good night for the California Republican Party. Or I guess I should say, once again, this was not a good night for the California Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 Coming into this contest, the Republican Party in California -- you know, California, the state of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and \uc2 Arnold Schwarzenegger\uc2  -- did not control a single statewide office. In the contest you covered last night, to replace Senator Barbara Boxer (a Democrat), a Republican did not even make it to the runoff. And the winning campaign \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  ran for the Republican presidential nomination, with its emphasis on battling illegal immigration and his challenge to the ''Mexican'' judge, is pretty much the stuff of nightmares for moderate California Republicans who have been trying to fashion a party that can appeal to the changing demographics of this state. Just how badly did the Republicans do in the Senate race?\par \par \uc2 JENNIFER MEDINA: I think it's fair to say: Downright terrible.\par \par \uc2 For the first time in a century, no Republican will be on the ballot for the state's Senate seat. No Republican even approached 10 percent of the total vote, and the top three combined received less than a million votes.\par \par \uc2 Now, part of the problem for the Republicans was a very crowded ballot -- there were more than 34 candidates, a dozen of them Republicans -- so whatever support they might have had was divvied up into tiny slices. But judging by last night's results, even if the party had unified around one candidate, they would have had a hard time making the ballot. This is probably not what Duf Sundheim, a former state party chairman who won 8 percent of the vote last night, had in mind when he backed California's move to an open primary system in 2010.\par \par \uc2 NAGOURNEY: No doubt about that. If I'm reading our results correctly, Loretta Sanchez, the Democrat who came in second behind Kamala Harris, got 18.3 percent of the vote -- which is more than the three Republicans behind her got combined. Oof. Last time I checked, Republicans made up 24 percent of the electorate; Democrats made up 44 percent. The state party chairman, Jim Brulte, told me that he expected that disparity to get worse this year because Democrats, unlike Republicans, have a contested primary. At this rate, people who don't register with either party may someday outnumber Republicans.\par \par \uc2 A lot of people here say that the state party's downfall should be a cautionary lesson for national Republicans: that it all began when Republican leaders, including Gov. Pete Wilson, championed Proposition 187, a voter initiative in 1994 that would have cut off benefits for illegal immigrants. The initiative, which passed, was thrown out in court, but the damage was done. Does that make sense to you? How much of a big deal do you think Latino voters are here, and how much trouble is the Republican Party in with that part of the electorate?\par \par \uc2 MEDINA: Almost every Republican and Democrat I talk to in the state points to that anti-immigrant initiative as the beginning of the end for Republicans here. Latinos are nearing 40 percent of the total population in California and by all accounts are registering in record numbers, no doubt largely driven by Mr. Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. There's really a sense of ''Republicans don't want us'' among many immigrants, not just Latinos. Republican leaders here know that and have been making serious efforts to attract Latino and Asian moderates to run in local races, with some success. But they know that the fall election is going to make that job much, much harder, and it has to have them nervous about the potential for their further demise here.\par \par \uc2 NAGOURNEY: I've learned from the experience not to make sweeping predictions about politics. It's easy to forget this, but there is a long Republican history in this state. Karl Rove, who was the chief strategist for George W. Bush, used to insist in conversations with me back in 2004 that California was still a competitive state in presidential elections. (It wasn't. The last time the Republicans won a presidential race here was when Mr. Bush's father defeated Michael Dukakis in 1988, and the state was only becoming more Democratic.)\par \par \uc2 All that said, I am wary of falling into the Republican-Party-is-dead-in-California trap. Politics is fluid, and things always change. But I'll tell you what I think is a real problem for the California Republican Party: It's going to get tougher and tougher to find good candidates to run if the party is a minor party (and we are close to that) -- and more than that, if it is identified with the kind of anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  language that is coming from its standard-bearer, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 . Do you see any bright spots on the Republican horizon?\par \par \uc2 MEDINA: The Central Valley remains a Republican stronghold. Though the area is heavily Latino, and many of the agricultural business leaders strongly favor looser immigration laws, many there remain wary of Democrats. While several Republican members of Congress have faced fierce re-election battles in recent years, they have managed to hang on to their seats and performed well last night. It's also the home of Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, whose district has its own mixed feelings about immigration. It will be telling to see what Mr. McCarthy and his colleagues say in response to the kinds of comments coming from Mr. Trump. Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said through a spokesman on Monday that he voted for John Kasich, not Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 NAGOURNEY: I'll leave you and our readers with one final point on this, which may not make Jim Brulte very happy. If you look out over the landscape, there is a generation of younger Democratic candidates who are ready to move up as some of the older elected officials -- Gov. Jerry Brown, Senator \uc2 Dianne Feinstein\uc2  and Ms. Boxer -- move on. It starts with Ms. Harris, who would be the first black woman to serve in the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2  in 15 years, and Ms. Sanchez, who is Latina. Beyond this year, the bench includes Antonio Villaraigosa, the former Los Angeles mayor who is looking at a run for governor; Eric Garcetti, the Los Angeles mayor; and \uc2 Gavin Newsom\uc2 , the lieutenant governor who is also running for governor.\par \par \uc2 But the party's biggest challenge in the months ahead is maneuvering around the presidential candidacy of Mr. Trump. How it does that may say more than anything about its prospects going forward in a state that is now 40 percent Latino.\par \par \uc2 For the latest national news updates, follow @NYTNational on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160609ec690004h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

RUBIN; Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura and Lilia Blaise from Brussels.   \par \uc2 1,279 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 March 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BRUSSELS -- Federal prosecutors in Belgium announced Saturday that they had arrested a suspect believed to have been deeply involved in the Brussels plot. He was charged with participating in a terrorist group, in terrorist murders and in attempted terrorist murders.\par \par \uc2 The man was identified by the authorities as Fay\u231\'00\'E7al C. and in the Belgian press as Fay\u231\'00\'E7al Cheffou, an independent journalist.\par \par \uc2 Eric Van der Sijpt, a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor's office, said Saturday that the authorities were trying to determine if Mr. Cheffou was the man caught in a surveillance photograph on Tuesday right before the bombings at \uc2 Brussels Airport\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The man, shown wearing a white coat and a dark hat and pushing a luggage cart, is believed to have escaped around the same time that two accomplices detonated their explosives.\par \par \uc2 The police found no weapons or explosives during a search of Mr. Cheffou's home.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cheffou appears to have made a video in July 2014 in which he stood in front of a detention center for refugees and asylum seekers in Steenokkerzeel, near Zaventem, where \uc2 Brussels Airport\uc2  is. In the video, Mr. Cheffou criticized the government for serving Muslim refugees meals before the end of the daily fast during the month of Ramadan.\par \par \uc2 He was taken into custody on Thursday, and the judge in charge of the case issued a formal arrest warrant on Friday in keeping with Belgian law, which requires a hearing before a judge and a warrant to be issued within 24 hours to keep a suspect in detention.\par \par \uc2 Three other men were detained in Brussels for further questioning, the prosecutor's office said. One was identified as Rabah N., who was mistakenly identified as Salah A. in a previous news release, the prosecutor's office said.\par \par \uc2 Rabah N. is accused of being connected to Reda Kriket, the suspect detained on Thursday near Paris by the French authorities. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said on Thursday that Mr. Kriket was in the advanced stages of planning an attack in France.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kriket is believed to be a jihadist who raised money for a network of militants in 2012 and 2013 and traveled to Syria in late 2014. He was well known to the security services in both France and Belgium, and he was named in a 2015 court proceeding along with Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the chief on-the-ground planner of the Paris attacks.\par \par \uc2 Although details of the plot involving Mr. Kriket have not yet emerged, the authorities have said that so far it has not been linked to the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris or the attacks in Brussels last week.\par \par \uc2 Two other men were also being held. One, named in the prosecutor's statement as Abderamane A., has a criminal record in France, according to press reports from the time of his trial that gave his full name as Abderahmane Ameroud. He was 27 years old when he was accused of providing logistical support to the two Tunisian suicide bombers who assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Afghan opposition leader, in 2001. Mr. Ameroud was convicted of complicity in the murder in 2005.\par \par \uc2 He was also linked to an Afghan and Pakistani network that was suspected of training would-be jihadists in the forest of Fontainebleau near Paris and in the French Alps. In 2007, Mr. Ameroud, an illegal Algerian immigrant, was also convicted of being part of a terrorist enterprise.\par \par \uc2 The Massoud assassination took place two days before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York and at the Pentagon, and both were organized by Al Qaeda.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ameroud's lawyer at the time of his trial, Isabelle Coutant-Peyre, said Saturday in an interview that he was ''a really nice, sweet and polite person'' who was singled out because he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in France. She said she had never been convinced of his guilt.\par \par \uc2 ''He was on trial with six other people at the time and none of them seemed to know each other,'' Ms. Coutant-Peyre said. ''He was accused of having been to Afghanistan before Massoud's death but it was based on notes from French intelligence and nothing really substantial.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ameroud was sentenced in 2005 to seven years and served his time in a prison at Fleury-M\u233\'00\'E9rogis in a Paris suburb and at Prison de la Sant\u233\'00\'E9, which is in Paris. Ms. Coutant-Peyre said she believed that he had been deported to Algeria after serving his sentence.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ameroud was shot by the police on Friday and subdued at a tram stop in the Schaerbeek section of Brussels. Specific charges have not been filed yet, but the police said they were keeping him for an additional 24 hours for questioning.\par \par \uc2 The fourth man who the prosecutor said Saturday was being held and charged with participation in a terrorist group is named Aboubaker A. A man detained with him in a car was released.\par \par \uc2 The investigating judge in charge of these cases released a second person on Saturday, Tawfik A., who was detained Friday for questioning.\par \par \uc2 In Brussels, organizers canceled a ''march against fear'' planned for Sunday after the Belgian authorities urged people not to gather, citing the threat level and worries that the police would be stretched too thin to protect the march while continuing to investigate the attacks.\par \par \uc2 ''We invite citizens not to demonstrate tomorrow and to postpone their march to a later date,'' the Brussels police said in a statement after a news conference held by the interior minister and the mayor of Brussels.\par \par \uc2 ''We understand that everybody wants to express their emotions in these circumstances,'' the statement added.\par \par \uc2 On a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page set up by the organizers of the march, some users said they understood the need to cancel the event, but others disagreed.\par \par \uc2 ''By canceling we are showing them that we are afraid and they will have won,'' said a user named Aurore Vandenborre. ''I will be at the Bourse tomorrow,'' she added, referring to the pedestrian square in front of Brussels' 19th-century stock exchange building, where people have gathered around makeshift memorials since the attacks.\par \par \uc2 The Belgian federal crisis center published a brochure on Saturday titled ''Terrorist Attack: What Next?'' It provided guidelines for those with questions like ''How do children react to traumatic events?'' and ''What can you do for someone who survived an attack or someone who lost a loved one?''\par \par \uc2 Brussels Airport\uc2  said Saturday that it would remain closed until at least Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The security on Saturday at Brussels' biggest train station, known as Bruxelles-Midi, seemed back to normal on Saturday except that there were now police officers and soldiers stationed at doors on either end, and some side doors were blocked.\par \par \uc2 But the police and soldiers were checking neither bags nor backpacks, and their presence seemed to be aimed mostly at instilling confidence in passengers and passers-by.\par \par \uc2 Since December, rail travelers from Paris to Brussels have had to go through metal detectors and a scanner set up at the lead car before boarding their trains.\par \par \uc2 Although most trains here were on time, some with international destinations, in France or the Netherlands, were running late for unexplained reasons.\par \par \uc2 After passengers boarded a train to Paris, three police officers passed through every car, methodically asking each person to present a passport or identity card and then scrutinizing the document.\par \par \uc2 The authorities are trying to determine if they have this airport attack suspect in custody.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDPHOENIX -- When \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  campaigns in Arizona, he talks up the endorsements he has received from \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2  , the former governor who signed some of the nation's toughest immigration laws, and Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose aggressive pursuit of illegal immigrants has prompted discrimination charges by the Justice Department.\par \par \uc2 When Bernie Sanders campaigned here on Monday, he ceded the stage to a teenage girl, who spoke of her parents' arrest in a raid by Sheriff Arpaio and the reprieve from deportation they received from the federal government.\par \par \uc2 And in ads airing across the state this week -- his in English, hers in Spanish -- Ted Cruz and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  deliver opposing messages: Mr. Cruz vows to undo executive actions by President \uc2 Obama\uc2  delaying the deportation of certain undocumented immigrants, while Mrs. Clinton promises to stop deporting parents whose children are citizens of the United States.\par \par \uc2 The presidential race has moved to Arizona -- a state at the center of the nation's battle over immigration -- and each side is using the issue to try to woo a deeply divided electorate ahead of Primary Day on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 ''We're not just at the center of the immigration discussion,'' Tyler Bowyer, chairman of the Republican Party of Maricopa County, the state's most populous, said in an interview. ''The border is our backyard. We live the challenges of immigration every single day.''\par \par \uc2 Arizona is a state in demographic transition. Latinos are poised to become the majority, and they already account for the largest number of students in public schools. But the state is also a magnet for retirees, and older white residents play an outsize role in elections and tilt the state to the right.\par \par \uc2 Republicans control every statewide office and both chambers of the Legislature. There are currently several anti-immigration measures under consideration in the Legislature, and on Thursday, people who oppose these measures staged a protest at the office of \uc2 Gov. Doug Ducey\uc2  , a Republican who has not made his position on the bills known.\par \par \uc2 In many ways, Arizona's political battles over immigration predicted the tensions and divisions that are defining the presidential election. Mr. Trump is a prime example, with his promises to build a wall at the border and make Mexico pay for it. The state's Latino population swelled to 2.5 million last year from 440,000 in 1980, while the share of white residents has steadily declined.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Arpaio stepped up raids as conservative legislators pushed bills that imposed heavy sanctions on employers who hire undocumented immigrants and expanded the legal definition of identity theft to include anyone seeking employment without proper documentation.\par \par \uc2 Then, in 2010, Ms. Brewer signed the ''show me your papers'' law, which gave the police broad powers to question anyone suspected of being in the country illegally. It fueled national protests and boycotts, but also helped her win a second term, creating two images of Arizona: to some, a synonym for intolerance; to others, an example of how fed-up citizens and elected officials could fight back against illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Representative Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Phoenix, said in an interview, ''Our immigration laws have been a very effective tool to mobilize the right, and it's once again going to reward a politician who's going to be preying on people's anxieties, be it Cruz or Trump.''\par \par \uc2 Today, the state has fewer undocumented immigrants than it did in 2009, according to an analysis by the \uc2 Pew Hispanic Center\uc2  . And based on census numbers, scholars at the Morrison Institute for Public Policy at \uc2 Arizona State University\uc2  projected that four in five of the state's Latino residents will be a United States citizen by 2030.\par \par \uc2 Apprehensions by the Border Patrol have been on the decline, falling by 25 percent in the last fiscal year alone, in part because Mexico's improved economy has given fewer of its citizens reason to risk the perilous crossing.\par \par \uc2 Still, profound challenges remain, fueled by geography -- the border between Arizona and Mexico runs for about 370 miles -- and opportunity. This month, Border Patrol agents arrested a convicted sex offender who had previously been deported as well as a man wanted for murder in Maricopa County as they tried to enter the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 ''People are angry, they're upset,'' Ms. Brewer said in an interview. ''The heartache and the loss and the suffering of people who have been harmed by illegal immigrants who come across our border is very real.''\par \par \uc2 In 2011, the Justice Department accused Sheriff Arpaio of engaging in ''unconstitutional policing'' by unfairly targeting Latinos and demanding proof of citizenship. Two years later, a federal judge, G. Murray Snow of United States District Court in Phoenix, ruled that he and his deputies had systematically violated the constitutional rights of Latinos by targeting them during raids and traffic stops.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Arpaio is unrepentant. He said that of the 8,600 undocumented immigrants his office had turned over to federal immigration authorities after their arrests for felony and misdemeanor crimes in the past two years, 3,000 had returned to county jails. The reason, he said, ''is not that they're all running back across the border, is that the federal government is releasing them back onto our streets.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz's television ad here features Steve Ronnebeck of Mesa, Ariz., whose 21-year-old son, Grant, was killed last year during a robbery at a convenience store. An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a criminal record who was out on bond awaiting deportation is charged with murder in the case. The ad denounces Mr. Obama's executive actions on immigration.\par \par \uc2 ''I hope I get to be there the day President Cruz tears up those illegal executive actions instituted by President \uc2 Obama\uc2  ,'' Mr. Ronnebeck says in the ad.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton's TV ad -- titled ''Valent\u237\'00\'EDa,'' which in Spanish means ''courage'' -- opens with split-screen images of Mr. Trump and Mr. Arpaio and a narrator declaring, ''When it looks like everyone is against you, learn who is your best friend.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's pledge to build a wall continues to be his most popular applause line at his rallies here. By contrast, Mr. Sanders, who spent much of the week traveling the state, accused Sheriff Arpaio of using ''un-American and uncivilized law enforcement tactics'' against Latinos.\par \par \uc2 A Merrill poll of likely voters in Arizona conducted this month showed Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump tied if they were to face off in the general election, and Mr. Cruz with a six-point advantage over Mrs. Clinton. In a matchup between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, Mr. Sanders holds a three-point edge. The poll's margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points.\par \par \uc2 The only remaining candidate who has not campaigned in Arizona is John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, who nonetheless received the endorsement of the state's leading newspaper, The Arizona Republic, on Friday.\par \par \uc2 ''In an election year dominated by threats and put-downs,'' the newspaper's editorial board wrote of Mr. Kasich, ''the most understated candidate is the most competent.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: March 22, 2016, Tuesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the primary elections in Arizona misstated projections for 2030 about the citizenship of Latinos living in the state. The study estimates that four in five -- not one in five -- Latinos will be United States citizens by then..\par \par \uc2 Like much of Arizona's electorate, candidates differ sharply on immigration.

Telemundo and Salem are our partners in this debate, along with the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 We'd also like to welcome a very special guest with us here tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, the 41st president of the United States, George Herbert Walker Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Everyone here is looking forward to a lively debate. I'll be your moderator tonight. Joining me in the questioning, Telemundo host Maria Celesta Arrasas, CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash; and Salem Radio Network's Hugh Hewitt, who worked in the Reagan administration for six years.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, there are five Republican candidates and they're ready to join us right now.\par \par \uc2 Please welcome Ohio Governor John Kasich.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Businessman and real estate developer \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And retired neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the Republican candidates for president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Now please rise for our national anthem, performed by country music artist, Deana Carter.\par \par \uc2 (THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you very much, Deana Carter. A beautiful, beautiful national anthem.\par \par \uc2 The final debate before Super Tuesday begins right after this quick break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Welcome back to the \uc2 University of Houston\uc2  and the Republican presidential debate.\par \par \uc2 The candidates, they are now in place. Their positions were selected based on their standing in the delegate race through Nevada, with the top candidate in the center and the others extending outward.\par \par \uc2 I want to tell you how tonight's debate will work. As moderator, I will guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups, as will Maria Celeste, Dana Bash and Hugh Hewitt. Candidates, you'll have a minute and 15 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. We have timing lights that are visible to the candidates. Those lights will warn you when your time is up, and as the candidates requested, a bell will sound like this.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 We know you all want to jump and debate these critically important issues, but please wait until you're called on. These are the rules all of the candidates have agreed to.\par \par \uc2 It's time for the candidates to introduce themselves right now. You'll each have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, you're first.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: If someone had tried to describe today's America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief. Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead.\par \par \uc2 Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other. What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight. It's not about us, it's about the American people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Governor Kasich?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother's mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English. And I'm standing on this stage. It's pretty remarkable. But I want to tell you, there's a lot of young people watching tonight. You can do whatever you want to do in your life. America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight. So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them. Shoot for the stars. America's great, and you can do it. Thank you, Wolf.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Rubio?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, thank you. This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.\par \par \uc2 Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush began the Reagan Revolution. For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense. But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams. Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears.\par \par \uc2 I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Welcome to Texas.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Here, Texas provided my family with hope. Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college. Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas. I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here. CRUZ: When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses.\par \par \uc2 And, I'll tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didn't vote for you, but you're doing what you said you would do. And, as president, I will do the same.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you. My whole theme is make America great again. We don't win anymore as a country. We don't win with trade, we don't win with the military. ISIS, we can't even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me. We will.\par \par \uc2 We don't win in any capacity with healthcare. We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced. We just don't win.\par \par \uc2 You look at our borders, they're like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.\par \par \uc2 We're going to make a great country again. We're going to start winning again. We're going to win a lot, it's going to be a big difference, believe me. It's going to be a big difference.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you very much. It's now time to begin questions. Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday. When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded, and the biggest prize of the night is Texas.\par \par \uc2 Immigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo. So, that's where we begin.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. You've also promised to let what you call, ''the good ones'', come back in. Your words, ''the good ones'', after they've been deported.\par \par \uc2 Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in. He says that's the biggest difference between the two of you. He calls your plan amnesty. Is it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had.\par \par \uc2 As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration. It wouldn't even be a big subject.\par \par \uc2 But, we either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back -- some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine.\par \par \uc2 They're going to get in line with other people. The best of them will come back, but they're going to come back through a process.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz, what's wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, ''the good ones'' come back to the United States?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country -- our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs. Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.\par \par \uc2 You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona. Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what's happened there -- it was a very interesting article.\par \par \uc2 Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. That's who we need to be fighting for.\par \par \uc2 Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that's why I've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that's why I will do the same thing as president.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that? TRUMP: Well, I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Rubio?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama's. He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.\par \par \uc2 Are those claims correct?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I've been abundantly clear on this. When I'm president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border. And, that's not just the physical border with Mexico, it's Visa overstays. That's 45 percent of the problem right there.RUBIO: It also has to do -- that's why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth. And, until that happens, we're not doing anything else. And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support.\par \par \uc2 And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate. Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he's now taking are new to him.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship. In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.\par \par \uc2 And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.\par \par \uc2 My mom and dad -- my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.\par \par \uc2 So I think this is an important issue. And I think we are realizing increasingly that it's an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.\par \par \uc2 Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.\par \par \uc2 As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. It's the up season. People didn't want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get.\par \par \uc2 Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That -- my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation. You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.\par \par \uc2 And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president. He ran a terrible campaign. He was a terrible candidate. That's what I criticize Mitt Romney -- I mean, ran...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: No, he...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. That's an election that should have been won.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term ''self-deportation.'' I mean, that's on the record and people can look it up right now online.\par \par \uc2 But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it's really important, this point. I think it's fine, it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.\par \par \uc2 But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you're only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.\par \par \uc2 You hired some workers from Poland...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. You haven't hired anybody.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: In fact, some of the people...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And by the way, I've hired -- and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You've hired nobody.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Yes, you've hired a thousand from another country...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera. So don't tell me about that.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Let me just say -- let me finish the statement. This is important.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You haven't hired one person, you liar.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's wrong. That's wrong. Totally wrong.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That's a fact. People can look it up. I'm sure people are Googling it right now. Look it up. ''Trump Polish workers,'' you'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That happened.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Be quiet. Just be quiet.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Let me talk. I've hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well. Everybody was happy.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: You paid a million dollars.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And by the way, the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: But I've hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States. What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. That's existing law.\par \par \uc2 But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall. And in 2013, when I was fight against the ''gang of eight'' amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on ''Celebrity Apprentice.''\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: And indeed, if you look at the ''gang of eight,'' one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill. CRUZ: If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when you're funding open border politicians, you shouldn't be surprised when they fight for open borders.\par \par \uc2 And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty. And I'm the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I can only say this, and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now -- your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you.\par \par \uc2 I've had an amazing relationship with politicians -- with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman. As one magazine said, he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.\par \par \uc2 You get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican -- you don't have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you don't have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, I actually think Donald is right. He is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington. And he's right. He has supported -- he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be hiring illegal immigrants. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn't be funding the Gang of Eight. And, you know, he is right. When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let's actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn't like it.\par \par \uc2 And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that's not a good attribute for a president.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Here's a man -- Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form, he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  , which is a total violation. He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off, and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks.\par \par \uc2 Give me a break.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All right. We're going to move on to Governor Kasich.\par \par \uc2 Governor Kasich...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Wolf, can I respond to that attack?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in. He's been waiting patiently.\par \par \uc2 Governor Kasich, the idea -- you've said this, and I want to quote you now: ''The idea that we're going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it.'' Those are your words. Should people be allowed to break the law just because it's not feasible to stop them?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States. He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem -- a path to legalization. You see, that was a time when things worked. It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.\par \par \uc2 Look, I think there is an answer here. The answer is you complete the border. You let people know that once it's done, you don't have a right to come in. If you come in, we don't want any excuse. You're going to go back. But I favor a guest worker program. I think it's practical. And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans -- the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I'd make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service. And at the end, I'd give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. I don't think we're going to tear families apart. I don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I don't think -- first of all, I don't think it's practical and I don't think it reflects America.\par \par \uc2 You know what happened? The problem with President Reagan is we didn't get in there and actually finish the border. And I think it was probably business interests that affected it. But at the end of the day, let's be practical. Let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again. And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Dr. Carson, you've been critical of mass deportation. You said back in November you don't think Mr. Trump's plan necessarily represents the Republican Party. Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?CARSON: I believe in liberty and justice for all. I think everything that we do should be fair. And I've already described -- you know, how we can secure the border.\par \par \uc2 We need to secure all the borders, because it's not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily. And we have to stop that.\par \par \uc2 But in terms of the people who are here already, after we -- after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable. And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.\par \par \uc2 They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don't have to live underground anymore. And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.\par \par \uc2 If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through. I think that's the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.\par \par \uc2 And we have other ways of -- of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don't feel the need to come over here. That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: It's about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now. You've said the Mexican government will pay for it.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Correct.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen. The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen. In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox -- he said today, and I'm quoting him -- he said, ''I'm not going to pay for that,'' quote, ''effing wall.''\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 So if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that -- I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.\par \par \uc2 This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one. Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.\par \par \uc2 We're going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1,000 -- you need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago -- 2,000, is 13,000 miles. We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.\par \par \uc2 We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it's a real wall. This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at. This is a wall that's going to work.\par \par \uc2 Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: If the -- if the Mexicans don't pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, you know, I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth. We're losing so much. (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We're losing so much with Mexico and China -- with China, we're losing $500 billion a year. And then people say, ''don't we want to trade?'' I don't mind trading, but I don't want to lose $500 billion. I don't want to lose $58 billion.\par \par \uc2 Mexico just took \uc2 Carrier Corporation\uc2  , maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. They're building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.\par \par \uc2 And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. They're taking our businesses. I don't mind.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you. Senator Rubio?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Yeah, a couple points. If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor to do it. The second...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Such a cute sound bite.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: But it -- no, it's not a sound bite. It's a fact. Again, go online and \uc2 Google\uc2  it. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  , Polish workers. You'll see it.\par \par \uc2 The second thing, about the trade war -- I don't understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: All right, you know what?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Why don't you make them in America?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Because they devalue their currency -- they devalue their currencies...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, then make them in America.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... that makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business. You lose on everything...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, make them in America. TRUMP: Let me just tell you -- they de-value their currency. They de-value their currencies.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well then, make them in America.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business. You lose on everything you do.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, make them in America.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies. China, Mexico, everybody. Japan with the cars. They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: And so you make them in China and in Russia.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies. You've bankrupted..\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I -- and you know why? You know why?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: I don't know anything about...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know why?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... starting a university, and that was a fake university.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: One at a time.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: First of all...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: One at a time.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... first of all, that's called a...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: There are people who borrowed $36,000...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Hold on. One at a time, Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... to go to Trump University, and they're suing now -- $36,000 to go to a university...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And by the way -- and by the way...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... that's a fake school.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... and by the way...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  ...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... I've won most of the lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That's what they got for $36,000.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All right, I want to move on.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And they actually did a very good job, but I've won most of the lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Most of the lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: ... I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me. Hey Wolf, let me ask you. Am I allowed to respond to this?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You're allowed -- you've been responding.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK. Well let -- no, I haven't. I really haven't.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: He's talked through the whole thing.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Here's a guy -- here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed. You tell me about this guy. This is what we're going to have as president.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Here's a guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  would be right now?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no, no.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Selling watches in (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: (Inaudible) I took...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That's where he would be. TRUMP: That is so wrong. We'll work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Oh, OK. One million.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Oh, he doesn't make that money.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... more than $10 billion.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. I want to bring in Maria Celeste of Telemundo. Maria?\par \par \uc2 CELESTE: Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama's executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Correct.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants. This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I'm going to quote you (in Spanish) which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn't be fair to cancel it immediately.\par \par \uc2 So Senator Rubio, what changed?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: It didn't change.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: No, it's the same policy. It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will -- we will eliminate that executive order. The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. And it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2 -- someone who came here when they were 2 years old. I understand. I know people that are personally impacted by this.\par \par \uc2 The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesn't have the power to do that.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And he himself admitted that.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Senator, Senator...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: I'm sorry, but let me finish my...\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: ... but you went -- you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: No, but this is not about deportation. Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation. This is about DACA. DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional. I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.\par \par \uc2 Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional. No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English. So in what sense did he lie?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA. I am going to get rid of DACA. In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point. That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it. And new people will not be able to apply. In fact, I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.\par \par \uc2 That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away. But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take -- as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I have to say, he lied this time. He lied. 100 percent. 100 percent.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: You lied about the Polish workers.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes, yes, yes. 38 years ago.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: You lied to the students at Trump University.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Let Senator Cruz jump in.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Oh, he lied 38 years ago. All right, I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you're right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that. CRUZ: You know, we've both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program. Well, it'll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.\par \par \uc2 That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all.\par \par \uc2 You know, I'm reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies. When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.\par \par \uc2 Marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. Well, someday it should end, just not now. And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol. What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now. By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away. I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place, but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we're just going to yank it away from them.\par \par \uc2 And, again, you read the statement in Spanish. I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is -- at that time I was not a candidate for president. I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it. New applicants will not be able to apply. That is the end of DACA.\par \par \uc2 I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates.\par \par \uc2 (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage. As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other. Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.\par \par \uc2 So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well, Maria, you are right. It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants. It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.\par \par \uc2 You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal. That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community. The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.\par \par \uc2 You know, we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my father's story.\par \par \uc2 Telling my Dad's story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream. And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community. It is not working in the hispanic community, and I...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: I'm sorry I was mentioned...\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: ... Governor Kasich.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Maria I was mentioned in that. I was mentioned in that statement.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... OK. I was mentioned -- just because of the hispanic -- and I'll be brief.\par \par \uc2 A couple points, number one, I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American. We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)\par \par \uc2 And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.\par \par \uc2 Yes, it's an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it. But, I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... and, you can only do that through free enterprise. That's what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos. Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy (ph) report that concluded, and I'm going to quote it, ''if hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn't want them in the United States they won't pay attention to our next sentence.''\par \par \uc2 So, do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it?KASICH: Well, I'm not going to talk about that. I mean, I've got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don't like all this yelling and screaming at the debates. My mother's thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.\par \par \uc2 I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think. I'm going to tell you what I think. My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. I haven't changed anything with it.\par \par \uc2 And, look, my view is, we need economic growth. Everything starts with economic growth. And how do you get it? Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.\par \par \uc2 That gives you economic growth. I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.\par \par \uc2 But here's the thing that I believe. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.\par \par \uc2 Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.\par \par \uc2 It's what Jack Kemp used to say. A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats. And you know what? With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me. And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.\par \par \uc2 It's time to solve problems.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Dr. Carson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you, as a candidate, getting it?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: I didn't hear the first part of the question?\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen.\par \par \uc2 And one of them was that they shouldn't feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States, otherwise they wouldn't pay attention to one more sentence from candidates.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the \uc2 National Association for Latino Elected Officials\uc2  , I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.\par \par \uc2 And the reason that I don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group. You know, this is America. And we need to have policies that are -- that give liberty and justice to all people.\par \par \uc2 And that's the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that. And I think that's the way the Republican Party generally thinks. We don't pick and choose winners and losers. We are compassionate.\par \par \uc2 But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America. When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Mr. Trump, it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race. You keep saying that Hispanics love you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: True.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: And, yes, you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: True.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you. They don't like you. Wouldn't that make you an unelectable...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: ... candidate in a general election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: First of all, I don't believe anything Telemundo says.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: You used to say that you love...\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Number one. Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. They're incredible people. They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.\par \par \uc2 I won with every single category. I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.\par \par \uc2 They get it. They're incredible people. They're incredible workers. They get it. And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics. I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll.\par \par \uc2 But one thing I'm also going to do, I'm going to be getting -- bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you're seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.\par \par \uc2 And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in. We're getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that.TRUMP: We're getting record-setting numbers. And I won every one -- the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: New people are coming into the Republican Party. We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: For the record, you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past. But it is not just a Telemundo poll. We have...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I love them. I love them.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: All right. Well, it's not the only poll.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They're fine. Do you know what? They're fine.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Just last night -- let me -- let me finish, please.\par \par \uc2 Just last night, The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you. And concerning the Nevada victory, allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample, statistically insignificant of only about 100 -- let me finish please -- of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Why did they take the poll? Why did they...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: I am making reference -- I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm just telling you, I'm doing very well with Hispanics. And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision. It was settled. We're good friends now. It was all settled up.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 Very happy, very happy. Very good people.\par \par \uc2 I'm just telling you -- I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics. I will do better than anybody on this stage. I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics. But I'm telling you also, I'm bringing people, Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.\par \par \uc2 I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2  , where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue. I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.\par \par \uc2 Hugh?\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf.\par \par \uc2 To me, it's the most important issue. I'll start with you, Senator Cruz. Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it -- Justice Scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election. Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance. We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.\par \par \uc2 Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this -- this stage. In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. So I'm certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.\par \par \uc2 But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000. Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.\par \par \uc2 I've spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they're asking the question: Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty. Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies -- all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it's repealed, it was a five-four decision, they're going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills. They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.\par \par \uc2 Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes, I would. And I've been there. And I've been there very strongly. I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault. It's not Ted's fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 That is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge. But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way -- no way that he should have approved Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen. But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz's criticism?CRUZ: Well, listen -- Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts. Yes, it's true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.\par \par \uc2 But I would not have nominated John Roberts. I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals. And I'll tell you, Hugh...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... you know, it's interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who -- who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.\par \par \uc2 Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.\par \par \uc2 And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... and cut a deal.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: So that means on Supreme Court...\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: ... can I...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... he's going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who won't cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Can I trust you on religious liberty?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, let -- let me -- let me just say -- let me just say this. Look, I watched Ted -- and I respected it, but he gets nowhere -- stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.\par \par \uc2 I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work. OK? We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.\par \par \uc2 It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that. Now, Ted's been very critical -- I have a sister who's a brilliant...\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... excuse me. She's a brilliant judge. He's been criticizing -- he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.\par \par \uc2 So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted. What do you think?\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Let me -- Senator.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution. I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can't have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it. You've got to be willing to cut a deal.\par \par \uc2 And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald -- \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Why? Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 You know what, Donald...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Senator Rubio.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... I don't want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you? Crazy zealot -- give me a break.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Senator Rubio, you've heard this exchange on religious liberty. You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera. Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here -- the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.\par \par \uc2 Justice Scalia -- in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document -- it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.\par \par \uc2 And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia -- plus there may be at least two other vacancies.\par \par \uc2 So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.\par \par \uc2 Now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement. But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you don't have a record there to look at and say, ''I feel at peace that when \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is president of the United States, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues.''\par \par \uc2 In fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood. He says he's not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel. These are concerning things.\par \par \uc2 And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  , if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, let -- let me just say -- let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative -- more importantly, he was a great president. A great president.\par \par \uc2 As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life. I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women -- cervical cancer, breast cancer -- are helped by Planned Parenthood.\par \par \uc2 So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldn't fund it.\par \par \uc2 I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent. I don't know what percentage it is. They say it's 3 percent. But I would defund it, because I'm pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty. You've been a little bit less emphatic. You've said, same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake. Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people? KASICH: Well, you know, , of course. I mean, if -- look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church. Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in. No question and no doubt about it.\par \par \uc2 Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don't favor it. I've always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I've moved on. And what I've said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?\par \par \uc2 If you're in the business of selling things, if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with, OK, today I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, and tomorrow maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced.\par \par \uc2 I mean, if you're in the business of commerce, conduct commerce. That's my view. And if you don't agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.\par \par \uc2 But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions. And look, I've appointed over a hundred judges as governor. I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 And you know what they are? They're conservatives. Go check it out. They are conservatives. They don't make the law. They interpret the law. That's all they do. And they stick by the Constitution. So I will do that.\par \par \uc2 But let's just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that. I think my position is clear.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you. Are their positions clear?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Are the positions you've heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia. I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago. A tremendous wit and intellect.\par \par \uc2 As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights. And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.\par \par \uc2 But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights. So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it. That's unfair.\par \par \uc2 And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done. That's why we have divided government. And we're going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.\par \par \uc2 And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person's life has been. What have they done in the past? What kind of judgments have they made? What kind of associations do they have? That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.\par \par \uc2 The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let's talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it. I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good. So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare. Are you saying that you're worried he won't?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: The individual mandate. He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don't believe that should be part of it. That should not remain there. I think here's what we need to replace it with.\par \par \uc2 We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again. If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.\par \par \uc2 Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.\par \par \uc2 And if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate. Would you respond?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We're going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.\par \par \uc2 I think we need it. I think it's a modern age. And I think we have to have it.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: OK, so let's talk about pre-existing conditions. What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance. Are they wrong?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I think they're wrong 100 percent. What we need -- look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians. The insurance companies get what they want. We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition. TRUMP: We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.\par \par \uc2 The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests. They got -- I'm not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they're part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.\par \par \uc2 And, actually, the Governor too, let's just talk about these too, OK?\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Because I don't think the Governor had too much to do with this.\par \par \uc2 But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition. The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.\par \par \uc2 I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm the only one in either party self-funding my campaign. I'm going to do what's right. We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.\par \par \uc2 BASH But, Mr. Trump...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... And, you're going to see -- excuse me. You're going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay. Right now they're making a fortune.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: But, just to be specific here, what you're saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's going to solve the problem. And, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it. They want to say -- they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is. I know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine. The top guys, they're friends of mine. I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest. They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience. One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. He's not laughing so much anymore.\par \par \uc2 Hi.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune. Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing. Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans. But, we should keep preexisting conditions.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don't follow this stuff very closely, but here's what happened. When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.\par \par \uc2 And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund. The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that. They're suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.\par \par \uc2 Here's what you didn't hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing. What is your plan? I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means. This is not a game where you draw maps...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... And, you don't know what it means...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: What is your plan on healthcare?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You don't know.\par \par \uc2 BASH: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... The biggest problem...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... What's your plan...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... The biggest problem, I'll have you know...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... What's your plan... TRUMP: ... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie. I got to tell you, the biggest problem he's got is he really doesn't know about the lines. The biggest thing we've got, and the reason we've got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... We already mentioned that (inaudible) plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... You don't know much...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... So, you're only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states. What else is part of your healthcare plan...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... The lines around the states...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... That's your only plan...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... and, it was almost done -- not now...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... Alright, (inaudible)...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... Excuse me. Excuse me.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... His plan. That was the plan...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition. So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll have many. They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Alright...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: So, that's the only part of the plan? Just the lines?\par \par \uc2 BASH: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: The nice part of the plan -- you'll have many different plans. You'll have competition, you'll have so many different plans.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Now he's repeating himself.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no, no.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 (CHEERING)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: (inaudible) I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago... RUBIO: ... I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I've never seen it in anybody...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... Let's stay focused on the subject...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... I thought he came out of the swimming pool...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... I see him repeat himself every night, he says five things, everyone's dumb, he's gonna make America great again...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... Senator Rubio...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... We're going to win, win win, he's winning in the polls...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... Senator Rubio, please.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... And the lines around the state.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... Every night.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Senator Rubio.\par \par \uc2 (CHEERING)\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I tell the truth, I tell the truth.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Senator Rubio, you will have time to respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond to what you've just posed to him...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... Yeah, he's going to give us his plan now, right? OK...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... If you could talk a little bit more about your plan. I know you talked about...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... We're going to have many different plans because...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... Can you be a little specific...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... competition...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... He's done it again.\par \par \uc2 (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies. They're going to have many, many different plans. BASH: Is there anything else you would like to add to that...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, there's nothing to add.\par \par \uc2 (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: What is to add?\par \par \uc2 BASH: Thank you. Thank you both.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Alright.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Governor Kasich, you've said it is, quote, ''Un American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition.''BASH: Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: No, I wouldn't. And -- but that doesn't matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions. You don't want any American to lose their house, everything they've saved, because they get sick. Now, I think it is more complicated than what we've heard here tonight. We're actually running significant health reform in my state.\par \par \uc2 I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons. I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don't want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.\par \par \uc2 And then we're driving towards total transparency. If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it's easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill. The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.\par \par \uc2 And I'll tell you what we will do. We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices. We actually are going to make the market work.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate. In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate. So what changed?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, Dana, \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2  had this position as well. And when I look at it, I don't think it's tenable. And we don't need to do that. Again, I'm telling you that we are going to -- we have a proposal, a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint -- some charge high, some charge low. If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.\par \par \uc2 That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare. Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher. And you know what? At some point, people can't afford it. Our plan will work. It uses the market. It uses transparency. It gets the patient in the middle. And guess what? We're actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country. And if this will go -- this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on. We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.\par \par \uc2 We don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana. So that's really what we're doing. This is not a theory. This is what we are actually doing in our state. We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives. If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what? They will get a financial reward.\par \par \uc2 Our primary care physicians need help. They need support. We're losing them. This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Governor Kasich, thank you.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients. You support covering preexisting conditions. How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right. But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.\par \par \uc2 I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats. And we give it to everybody from birth until death. They can pass it on when they die. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. So dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.\par \par \uc2 And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. It gives you enormous flexibility. And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there.\par \par \uc2 Also, the -- your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare. So, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered. One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year. You can buy the $1,500 one. That will take care of 75 percent of the people. The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? Medicaid. What's the Medicaid budget? Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.CARSON: But do the math. Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all -- they will have a lot more flexibility. What could you buy with that? A concierge practice.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: And you could still have thousands of dollars left over. And let me just finish, because I don't get to talk that much. And, you know, let's...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... you can have the money that's left over to buy your catastrophic insurance. But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.\par \par \uc2 It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that's probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Dr. Carson. Let's talk about the economy. Let's talk about...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Wolf, Wolf, Wolf. Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I want to move on, but there'll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: It's kind of an issue I have a long history with.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I know you do. And -- all right, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Thank you, Wolf.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: How do you -- how do you get that extra time, Cruz? You're very good at... CRUZ: You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements. On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful. I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons. I want to end it because it goes too far, it's killed millions of jobs, and it's hurting people's health care. Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn't go nearly far enough. And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.\par \par \uc2 What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless. Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years. Now let me tell you if you're a small business owner, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  's socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you're elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it's been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don't get that hip replacement, you don't get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.\par \par \uc2 I'll tell you this. As president...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... I will repeal every word of Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you, thank you. Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand. He goes around saying oh, he wants it. I do not want socialized medicine. I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.\par \par \uc2 In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on. That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium. You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more. We have to get rid of Obamacare. It is going to destroy our economy completely. Our economy is not doing well. It is going to destroy our economy greatly. And on that, I agree.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Donald, true or false, you've said the government should pay for everyone's health care.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's false.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You've never said that?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: But you've never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I did not. No I did not.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care, you have no heart.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Correct. I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Have you said you're a liberal on health care?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me. Let me talk. If people...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Talk away. Explain your plan, please.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: If people -- my plan is very simple. I will not -- we're going to have private -- we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president. You may let it and you may be fine with it...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: So does the government pay for everyone's health care?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... I'm not fine with it. We are going to take those people...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Yes or no. Just answer the question.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me. We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals. We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Who pays for it?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, can I just clarify something?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentleman, please.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Wolf, no. I want to clarify something.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentlemen please. I want to move on.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: This is a Republican debate, right? Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I want to talk about the economy.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentleman, gentleman. All of you have agreed -- Senator Cruz...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know what? Call it what you want.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: It's a yes or no.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All of you have agreed -- all of you have agreed to the rules. I want to move on. We're talking about the economy right now. Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did. The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.\par \par \uc2 How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn't saddled with even more debt? TRUMP: Because the country will become a dynamic economy. We'll be dynamic again. If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax. We have the highest taxes in the world.\par \par \uc2 It's shutting off our economy. It's shutting off our country. We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in. Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great. We will have a dynamic economy again.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We're going to make many cuts in business. We're getting rid of -- we're going to get rid of so many different things. Department of Education -- Common Core is out. We're going local. Have to go local.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Environmental protection -- we waste all of this money. We're going to bring that back to the states. And we're going to have other (inaudible) many things. (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump. If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that's about $68 billion. If you eliminate the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  , that's about $8 billion. That's about $76 billion for those two agencies.\par \par \uc2 The current deficit this year is $544 billion. Where are you going to come up with the money?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place. Waste, fraud and abuse.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 You look at what's happening with Social Security, you look -- look at what's happening with every agency -- waste, fraud and abuse. We will cut so much, your head will spin.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Governor Kasich.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee. You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had. Can Mr. Trump's plan work?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf. And I've done it. I mean, I -- we got the budget balanced. We cut the capital gains tax. You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.\par \par \uc2 And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance. We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington -- every single one of them -- and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.\par \par \uc2 And why do you do it? Because you want job growth. If you don't have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won't get there. You will never be able to do it.\par \par \uc2 Now, I -- I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts -- the biggest of any governor in the country -- and we have a fiscal plan.\par \par \uc2 And it's not all -- it's not always cutting. It's innovating -- it's producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price. Now we have a $2 billion surplus. Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.\par \par \uc2 And, look -- I've got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.\par \par \uc2 I've done it -- I did it in Washington -- four years of balanced budgets. No one could even believe it happened.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 I've done it in Ohio, we're growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity. And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people. I promise you that.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, governor.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Speaking of taxes...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I just want to say -- and I'm a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: OK, let me -- let me -- let me just talk about that, because I know that -- that Donald believes the energy industry is important. So do I. But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it's early-stage.\par \par \uc2 See, what we've done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that's jobs-friendly. We have diversified our economy.\par \par \uc2 We -- we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon -- their Cloud computing in the Midwest. You know why it's happening?\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 Because we're balanced budgets, we're strong, we're job-friendly, we don't raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs. Jobs, jobs and jobs, period.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and I'm quoting him now, ''there is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them.''\par \par \uc2 Romney said either you're not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven't paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven't been giving the money to veterans or disabled people. Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: All right. First of all, let me just explain. I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form -- almost 100 pages. You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return. You learn it from statements. TRUMP: I filed -- which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion. I built a great company with very little debt. People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down. And I filed it on time. I didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.\par \par \uc2 So as far as that's concerned, I filed it. And that's where you find out what kind of a company. You don't learn anything from a tax return.\par \par \uc2 I will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed. And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully. And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election. And it cost him big league.\par \par \uc2 As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year. Twelve years, or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.\par \par \uc2 Nobody gets audited -- I have friends that are very wealthy people. They never get audited. I get audited every year. I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously. And I think people would understand that.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Hugh, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump. You told me...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Are you going to ask anybody else that question?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: Yes, amen, amen.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Every single question comes to me?\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I know I'm here for the ratings, but it's a little bit ridiculous.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER) HEWITT: Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  , that you would release your tax returns.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: True.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Are you going back on your commitment?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I'm not. First of all, very few people listen to your radio show. That's the good news.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Let me just tell you, let me just -- which happens to be true. Check out the ratings.\par \par \uc2 Look, let me just tell you something. Let me just tell you something. I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit. We're under a routine audit. I've had it for years, I get audited.\par \par \uc2 And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns. Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released. And you said, coming out any day momentarily. When are we going to see your returns?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them. And there's nothing really that interesting in them. So I have no problem releasing them. And luckily I'm not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: But this is my time. I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt. This is an important issue. It's a huge issue, OK? In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.\par \par \uc2 That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.\par \par \uc2 You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I've been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.\par \par \uc2 And I think if we -- the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis. And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question. This debt issue is -- the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.\par \par \uc2 It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis. And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Thank you, Senator Rubio. But I am...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: I'm being fair to all of the candidates.\par \par \uc2 Senator Cruz, Tuesday is five days away. Why haven't voters seen your 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: So, I've released five years of tax returns already. We will have two more years available tomorrow. And I would note that this question really goes -- you know, Donald says he's being audited.\par \par \uc2 Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns. If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.\par \par \uc2 And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis. The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016. And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.\par \par \uc2 Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them. In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary. And this is an example.\par \par \uc2 You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now. They're going to pick apart his taxes. They're going to pick apart his business deals.\par \par \uc2 And let's take, for example, one of Hillary's great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2  , the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.CRUZ: The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary. And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, ''but gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation. I even went to your wedding.''\par \par \uc2 He can't prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can't risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat. And I have, over the years. I'm a businessman. I have, over the years.\par \par \uc2 And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he's doing well in the polls. Well, I'm beating him in virtually every poll. I'm tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn't be. But I think I'll do very well.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 But a poll just came out -- a Bloomberg poll -- where I am beating him so badly that it's, like, embarrassing even for me to say I'm beating him that badly.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And -- and here's the thing -- it was sort of funny -- 65 percent of the people don't like you -- I just got 36 percent of the vote, right? I just got 46 percent on another one. I got 38 percent...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... on another one. That means -- and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly -- that was going to be his stronghold. He said a year ago, ''I can't lose South Carolina.'' I beat him in a landslide.\par \par \uc2 Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sang (ph) about the polls. One other thing -- Hillary Clinton -- take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll. I beat her, and I beat her badly. And I -- and I haven't even started at her. I only had one little interchange...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... I only had one little interchange, and that was...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist. And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary. They had a rough weekend.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Gentlemen.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Hold on. He -- he attacked me, Wolf. I get a response.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I was about to say -- Senator Cruz, respond.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Thank you. Thank -- thank -- thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 You know, it's interesting -- Donald went -- went on -- on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn't respond to any of the substance. He has yet to say -- he can release past year's tax returns. He can do it tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 He doesn't want to do it, because presumably there's something in there...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Nothing.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... that is bad. If there's nothing, release them tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: They're already prepared. The only reason he's not releasing them...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You -- you don't...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... is because he's afraid that he will get hit.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm not afraid (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University. It's a fraud case. His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.\par \par \uc2 I want you to think about, if this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud. You don't think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?\par \par \uc2 And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All right (ph)...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: If -- we've got to win this election, and we can't do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and can't take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump. Mr, -- hold on. Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... first of all, he's talking about the polls. I'm beating him awfully badly in the polls.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: But you're not beating Hillary. You're not beating Hillary.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, then, if I can't -- if -- hey, if I can't beat her, you're really going to get killed, aren't you?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: So -- so let me ask you this, because you're really getting beaten badly. I know you're embarrassed -- I know you're embarrassed, but keep fighting -- keep swinging, man (ph). Swing for the fences.\par \par \uc2 Let me just tell you -- let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case. Not a -- it's a civil case. It's a case where people want to try and get -- it's a case that is nonsense.\par \par \uc2 It's something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle. The people that took the course all signed -- most -- many -- many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.\par \par \uc2 As -- and believe me, I'll win that case. That's an easy case. Civil case. Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I'm being audited. It's a very routine audit, and it's very unfair, because I've been audited for, I think, over 12 years.\par \par \uc2 Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I'm being audited -- which is a very large company.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm being audited 12 years in a row, at least.\par \par \uc2 Now, until that audit's done, and I don't think anybody would blame me, I'm not giving it...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... the years you're not being audited? Will you release those years?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen, thank you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: (inaudible) audited for those years.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Which years? Which years are you being audited?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentlemen...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: ... we actually have rules -- we're trying to obey these rules that all of you agreed. We're going to take a quick break. We have a lot more -- many more critically important issues to discuss.\par \par \uc2 Our coverage of this tenth Republican presidential debate from the \uc2 University of Houston\uc2  continues in a moment.(APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here at the \uc2 University of Houston\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Gentlemen, I want to turn our attention right now to key issues involving foreign policy and national security. And Mr. Trump, I'll begin with you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Shocking.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You said this about the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians -- I'm quoting you now: ''Let me be sort of a neutral guy. I don't want to say whose fault it is, I don't think it helps.''\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Right.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Here's the question. How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, first of all, I don't think they do under President Obama because I think he's treated Israel horribly, all right? I think he's treated Israel horribly. (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel. I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.\par \par \uc2 As president, however, there's nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally. And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.\par \par \uc2 Now, I may not be successful in doing it. It's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind. OK? But it doesn't help if I start saying, ''I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage.'' But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.\par \par \uc2 And I can't do that as well -- as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big, big sides. With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly. Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald's word, between Israel and the Palestinians.\par \par \uc2 Let me be clear. If I'm president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media. Listen, it is not equivalent. When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel. And I will not pretend that they are.\par \par \uc2 Just today, Iran announced they're going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber. And I would note, missing from Donald's answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel. I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel. And this -- if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I can only say -- look, I can only say I've been a big contributor to Israel over the years. I've received many, many awards from Israel, as I've said before. I have a great relationship with Israel. And I'm going to keep it that way. And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing. It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee. And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things. And I've been a supporter of Israel -- a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage. I didn't give as much money as Donald gave, but I've been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.\par \par \uc2 And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with. Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving. And one -- are moving because they're not sure what we will do.\par \par \uc2 It's a very interesting development here within the 24 hours. We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system. It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.\par \par \uc2 When we stand firm and we let the world know who we're with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: We're going to get to North Korea in a moment. But Senator Rubio, what's wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Because -- and I don't know if Donald realizes this. I'm sure it's not his intent perhaps. But the position you've taken is an anti-Israel position. And here's why. Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith. The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels. Instead, here's what the Palestinians do. They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing. Here's what Hamas does. They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis. The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.\par \par \uc2 And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel. I'm not -- I'm not going to sit here and say, ''Oh, I'm not on either side.'' I will be on a side. I will be on Israel's side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm a negotiator. I've done very well over the years through negotiation. It's very important that we do that. In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator. I watched him melt down and I'll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen. He's not going down -- excuse me...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie. OK?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK, no, no, no -- a deal is a deal. Let me tell you that. I learned a long time ago.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: A deal is not a deal when you're dealing with terrorists. Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You are not a negotiator. You are not a negotiator. (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace. You will never bring peace...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... Donald, might be able to (inaudible) Palestinians and Arabs, but it's not a real estate deal...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: ... Senator.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: He will never be able to do it. I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this. Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Let's move on to talk about North Korea. You raised it, Governor Kasich. The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its sallies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened. You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.\par \par \uc2 Let's be clear. Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change. That's what it means. Even though there's so much chaos in North Korea right now, there's a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.\par \par \uc2 But, look, here's what I think we ought to do -- like, immediately. And, we've been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don't know, 15 years. We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they're not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.\par \par \uc2 Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.\par \par \uc2 Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don't have the toughest sanctions on North Korea. We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology. And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology. Because we're now starting to take a firm position. We have the attention of the Chinese. The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.\par \par \uc2 But, when I say regime change, I don't have to talk exactly what that means. Look, I've been involved in national security for a long time. You don't have to spell everything out, but what I'm telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese. And, what we're doing is beginning to work against them.\par \par \uc2 They are the key to being able to settle this situation.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important. There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... I'm very well aware of that.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between. Would you risk war for a regime change?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening. What the situation was. But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability? Because, I'll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we're going to face this sooner or later.\par \par \uc2 But, in the meantime, I'm also aware of the fact that there's 10 million people living in Seoul. So, you don't just run around making charges. I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.\par \par \uc2 Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear. We have to be firm, and we've got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: One thing I'd like to add to what the Governor's saying, I think that we are now in a position -- are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion dollars. We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.\par \par \uc2 You order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries. Whether it's a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit. They're coming out of these countries. They are making a fortune. Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia. Before the oil went down, now they're making less, but they're making plenty. They were making $1 billion dollars a day.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 We defend all of these countries for peanuts. You talk about budgets. We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Hey, Wolf, Wolf...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Dr. Carson.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this. Look, we're all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more. We're all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job. There is no question about it.\par \par \uc2 But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military. Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense. We need to rebuild our defenses,\par \par \uc2 But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 We can't have a weapon system take 22 and a half years. We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: ... Thank you...\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... these resources into strengthening the military. So, we can do it all...BLITZER: Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don't get time. I'm going to whine because I didn't get asked about taxes, I didn't get asked about Israel. Hugh, you said you're going to be fair to everybody, you didn't ask me about taxes. I had something to say about that.\par \par \uc2 Now...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Go ahead. This is your moment.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 CARSON: OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. And then they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the whole year. And they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the next year and the next year. They didn't find anything and they won't find anything because I'm a very honest person.\par \par \uc2 But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people. I couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on Israel. You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel. It doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people. We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.\par \par \uc2 And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. And I think we have to present strength to him. We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea. We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.\par \par \uc2 And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. We need to be able to defend ourselves. And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. We're going to continue with national security. Go ahead, Hugh.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf. Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia. Do you support this ceasefire?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing. So It's a meaningless ceasefire.\par \par \uc2 I love the idea of a ceasefire. I love the idea of -- with a total cessation. But it's not working, as you know very well. It's not working. If -- we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.\par \par \uc2 So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well look. We're certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there's reason to be highly skeptical. Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama's weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria. And you know, as we're headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya. That was a disaster. It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.\par \par \uc2 Another example is John Kerry. John Kerry -- Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State. I voted against him. And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check. And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen. His diplomacy has been a disaster. And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest. I think they both liked me very much. But the fact is that ...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: But you called for Bush to be impeached.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned. You know it and so do I.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Be honest. Be honest. No, this was before. The check came early. TRUMP: But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria. He said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.\par \par \uc2 If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be -- at least they killed terrorists, all right?\par \par \uc2 And I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting. You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil. As we speak, it's a total mess.\par \par \uc2 We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Senator Rubio.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Yes, a couple of points. Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn't topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi. The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?\par \par \uc2 And I argued if it takes a long time, you're going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum. And that's what happened. That's where the term ''lead from behind'' came. And that's the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.\par \par \uc2 On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn't appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department. And she was absolutely horrible.\par \par \uc2 I couldn't imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we're asking to be commander-in-chief. Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief. And he's saying these guys need to do more.\par \par \uc2 South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort. And Japan contributes as well. And here's why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.\par \par \uc2 They can do that very quickly. And that's what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can't walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I never said walk away. I wouldn't want to walk away. I want them to pay us much more money. We cannot afford to subsidize...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: How much?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: A lot. I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.\par \par \uc2 As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.\par \par \uc2 It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel. I'm no fan of John Kerry.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Hold on, hold on, Governor.\par \par \uc2 Senator Cruz.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, it's interesting, Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gadhafi in Libya. Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org.\par \par \uc2 You can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth. And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.\par \par \uc2 With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades. That's why I voted against him when he came up. And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.\par \par \uc2 And I'll give one more example on Israel. When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?\par \par \uc2 The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London. Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.\par \par \uc2 During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald? If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?\par \par \uc2 If you care about Israel, you don't write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel. Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 KASICH: There's a critical point that needs to be made here.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Governor, Governor, Governor, he attacked Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has a right to respond.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, look, my response is very simple. There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have. Nobody. You might say, you might talk, you're politicians, all talk, no action.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I've been watching it all my life. You are all talk and no action.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Then name one specific thing you've done.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: What I've seen up here -- I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar. You have a combination...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: This guy always goes for...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You have a combination of factors. He can't do it...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: This is so typical.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... for the obvious reason, and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth. Other than that, I rest my case.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: One at a time, gentlemen.\par \par \uc2 Governor Kasich, you have the floor. Governor...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You will have a response. But I promised Governor Kasich he could respond.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: Can somebody attack me, please? (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 KASICH: There's something -- I want to -- I want to point out something here today that is -- it's so critically important -- about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago. They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they're sitting in the catbird seat.\par \par \uc2 We should have been helping them. I'm thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria. But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.\par \par \uc2 Now, let's talk about Libya. Libya didn't go down because there was some people revolution. Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi. They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.\par \par \uc2 And let me just say to you -- we have ISIS beginning get -- get a foothold in Libya. We're gonna have to deal with it. There are not many major cities in Libya. They're on the coast, which -- mostly, it's desert, but it's a problem.\par \par \uc2 Then we have ISIS in -- in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq. Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit -- one of us here is going to inherit a total mess...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All right...\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... and we're going to have to work our way out of it, including...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Let's continue.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... the need to arm the Ukrainians. They have been ignored, and we need to help them as well...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Let us continue.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... and assert ourselves as America.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Let's continue the questioning on ISIS. Maria.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Hold on, Wolf. You said I got a response.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You'll have a chance. Maria will pick up...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Hold on. He called me a liar. You're saying I can't respond to being called a liar?\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Go ahead and respond.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, what we're seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington -- the pattern of Washington deal makers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.\par \par \uc2 And so that's Donald's pattern over and over again. He said, for example, seven months ago -- this is Donald speaking, quote -- ''I, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment.''\par \par \uc2 There's a reason Harry Reid thinks he's the best Republican up here. There's a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable. And every time anyone points at Donald's actual record...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... what he said on national television, Donald yells ''liar.'' Let me tell you something -- falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... and it's something Donald does daily.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I watched -- I watched...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... the lobbyists. I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race -- he has left Iowa and he's out of the race. And I thought it was disgraceful.\par \par \uc2 And got a lot of votes because of that -- a lot of votes. Took them away from Ben Carson. I watched that. Probably took them away from me, too. But I watched it.\par \par \uc2 I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, ''Voter Violation,'' and then it graded you...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz. I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it's the worst thing I've ever seen in politics.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 To me, that was even worse than what he did to Ben.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I know politicians -- I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do. And it's not good.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: I believe it. No, no. I believe you know politicians much better than I do, because for 40 years, you've been funding liberal Democratic politicians. And by the way...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I funded you. I funded him. Can you believe it?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... the reason is -- you're welcome to have the check back.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I funded this guy. I gave him a check.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Yeah, you gave me $5,000.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I gave him a check. He never funded me.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: And -- and by the way, let's be clear.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Donald claims -- Donald claims to care about...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know why? I didn't want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Donald. Donald. Donald. I understand rules are very hard for you. They're very confusing.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Mr. Trump, you're doing a great job. I have his book.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you -- thank you for the book. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Donald, you can get back on your meds now.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank -- thank you for the book. I really appreciate (ph).\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Donald -- Donald, relax.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead. I'm relaxed. You're the basket case.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Donald...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead. Don't get nervous.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: (inaudible)...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: I promise you, Donald, there's nothing about you...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I've seen you.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... that makes anyone nervous.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You're losing so badly you -- I want to...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, people are actually watching this at home.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... I -- you don't know what's happening.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Wolf, I'm going to ask my time not be deducted when he's yelling at me.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You've gotta stop this.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: The latest debate -- gentlemen, please.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Hold on, I'm going to get my answer. He doesn't get to yell the whole time. BLITZER: I want to move -- I want to move on. These are the rules.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Excuse me, he called me a liar, then interrupted the whole time. Am I allowed to...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Wolf, do I not get a response? Do I not get a response without being interrupted?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You'll get -- you'll get plenty of response, so stand by.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: My name was mentioned.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I want to talk -- I want to talk about ISIS right now, and the federal government -- how much best to keep Americans safe from ISIS.BLITZER: There's a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government. The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks. Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers. And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge's order.\par \par \uc2 Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Senator Rubio, you say it's complicated, and that, quote, ''Apple isn't necessarily wrong to refuse the court order.'' Why shouldn't investigators have everything at their disposal?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: No, in fact what I have said is the only thing -- the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago -- the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer. Apple initially came out saying, ''We're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device.'' That is not accurate.\par \par \uc2 The only thing they're being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that's in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.\par \par \uc2 And I think they should comply with that. If that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.\par \par \uc2 BASH: So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.\par \par \uc2 BASH: But just to be clear -- just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?\par \par \uc2 BASH: Correct.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Absolutely. That Apple phone didn't even belong to the killer. It belonged to the killer's employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this. That is all they're asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world. But Apple doesn't want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.\par \par \uc2 Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America. Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question. His answer, he was on both sides of the fence. He's now agreeing with me. And so I'm glad.\par \par \uc2 What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order. Why? Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause. In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone's cell phone. If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.\par \par \uc2 I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question. But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed. And absolutely, Apple doesn't have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America. What do you think?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 You know, we have the -- we have a Constitution. We have a Fourth Amendment. It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure. But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole. And that's why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.\par \par \uc2 So absolutely, I would -- I would expect Apple to comply with the court order. If they don't comply with that, you're encouraging chaos in our system.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Mr. Trump...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE) KASICH: I want to weigh in on this please. I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple. You know what the problem is? Where's the president been? You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out. You don't litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.\par \par \uc2 The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces. And then you know what you do when you're the president? You lock the door and you say you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans. This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.\par \par \uc2 And I'll tell you, that's why you want a governor. I do this all the time. And we reach agreements all the time. Because as an executive, you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 ARRARAS: Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.\par \par \uc2 As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat. You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada. When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn't? Isn't that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer. You're talking about a massive border.\par \par \uc2 We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts -- you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.\par \par \uc2 You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in. And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place -- it's beautiful. With the trees and the roads, and the countryside. Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it.\par \par \uc2 They're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security. I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget. It'll be a very high wall, a great wall. It's going to be built, it's going to be built. It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way -- maybe I'll get Canada to pay? Got to be paid for by Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece. You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer. It would be very, very hard to do, and we -- it is not our biggest problem. I don't care what anyone says. It is not our big problem. Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRARAS: I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico. As you know, Puerto Rico's in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it's debt of $72 billion dollars. Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that -- the tools to restructure the debt. That is the same debt the other 50 states have.\par \par \uc2 You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection. You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it's last resort. That that's where they are now. How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Sure, because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating, or you're going to be bankrupt again. And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it's economy is not growing. It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.\par \par \uc2 They're coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there. The tax rate is too high. The government regulations are too extensive.\par \par \uc2 This year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments.\par \par \uc2 So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.\par \par \uc2 They're United States citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust. And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.\par \par \uc2 Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... to someone who has taken a big government stance (ph) once again...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: ... Senator, thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I want our viewers to stay with us right now, including the last pitch in the final debate before Super Tuesday.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)\par \par \uc2 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Welcome back to the University of Houston. It's time now for closing statements. All of you will have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, we'll start with you.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. Think about that.\par \par \uc2 Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands. These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families. And I'm asking you tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America. If not us, who? And if not now, when?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Governor Kasich.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage. Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters. It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations. I've done it in Washington, I've done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.\par \par \uc2 But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.\par \par \uc2 I hope you all think about giving me your vote. I would appreciate it very much. And I tell you, we won't have to spend time figuring what we're going to do. I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again. Thank you all very much.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Rubio. RUBIO: Well, thank you for having us tonight. You know, this campaign has come a long way. It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it's narrowed and the votes are starting to count. And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.RUBIO: The time for games is over.\par \par \uc2 I know you've had a lot of choices to make, but now it's time to narrow it down. And I'm asking you to get behind me, go on our Web site and join you our effort, marcorubio.com, so we can bring an end to this silliness, this looniness, and once again re-embrace all the things that made America and the Republican Party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Washington deals are bankrupting this country. There are several deal-makers on this stage but there is only one person who has consistently stood up to both parties, fighting for the American people against the Washington deals.\par \par \uc2 If I'm elected president, on the first day in office I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action. I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations.\par \par \uc2 I will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today. I will rip to shreds the Iranian -- catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. And I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\par \par \uc2 We will repeal Obamacare, abolish of IRS, secure the border, and bring back jobs.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Nobody knows politicians better than I do. They're all talk, they're no action, nothing gets done. I've watched it for years. Take a look at what's happening to our country.\par \par \uc2 All of the things that I've been talking about, whether it's trade, whether it's building up our depleted military, whether it's taking care of our vets, whether it's getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done. Politicians will never, ever get it done. And we will make America great again. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.\par \par \uc2 And thanks to each of the candidates, on behalf of everyone here at CNN and Telemundo. We also want to thank the Republican National Committee and the University of Houston. My thanks also to Hugh Hewitt, Maria Celeste, and Dana Bash.\par \par \uc2 Super Tuesday is only five days away.\par \par \uc2 Right now Anderson Cooper picks up our special coverage -- Anderson.\par \par \uc2 COOPER: Wolf, thanks very much.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160226ec2q0008f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc43}{\*\bkmkend toc43}\b \uc2 Trump Primary Victory Could Clash With South Carolina's Image of Itself\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS   \par \uc2 1,187 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 February 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SUMMERVILLE, S.C. -- Republicans in South Carolina have in recent years raced ahead of the national party in presenting an inclusive face to voters: Since 2010, the state has elected an Indian-American governor and the country's only black Republican senator, and its Republican-controlled Legislature voted last summer to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the Capitol.\par \par \uc2 So, for party leaders and mainstream voters here, it may come as a kind of deflating climax if -- as is widely expected -- \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  wins the state's presidential primary on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 With a campaign message about cracking down on illegal immigration and fighting Middle Eastern terrorism with methods including torture, Mr. Trump has built a commanding lead in most South Carolina polls, though there have been some indications of a tightening race. His results in the two early states so far have alarmed more traditional Republicans, who fear that a Trump nomination would solidify for nonwhite voters an image of Republicans as an angry and intolerant party.\par \par \uc2 If Mr. Trump's candidacy carries high stakes for conservatives everywhere, the implications of his campaign may be especially weighty in the South, where politics has long been polarized along racial lines, and where a handful of Republicans have striven to broaden the party's appeal to black, Hispanic and Asian-American voters.\par \par \uc2 In South Carolina, Gov. Nikki R. Haley, the state's first nonwhite governor, and Senator Tim Scott, the first black senator elected from the South since Reconstruction, have both backed Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida as an alternative to Mr. Trump. The picture of the three of them campaigning together ''says a lot about the Republican Party,'' Mr. Rubio, who is of Cuban descent, said in an appearance on \uc2 CNN\uc2  on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The fear among Republican leaders here is that a smashing victory for Mr. Trump would say more about the party, and about the state, potentially undermining South Carolina's image as a more welcoming place that is no longer defined by figures like Strom Thurmond, the former segregationist presidential candidate who served in the Senate until 2003.\par \par \uc2 Former Gov. David M. Beasley, a Republican who sought unsuccessfully to bring down the Confederate flag during his single term in office, said Mr. Trump's campaign had given voice to a ''serious sense of frustration'' in the state. But he said the Trump message was not a fair approximation of South Carolina values.\par \par \uc2 ''It does not reflect South Carolina,'' said Mr. Beasley, who has not endorsed a candidate in the race. He added, ''Trump has been very divisive, and it's a strategy that he has taken to be, clearly, a non-establishment candidate.''\par \par \uc2 Ted Pitts, the president of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, said it would be inappropriate to judge the state ''based on a Republican primary winner who didn't get a majority of the vote.''\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think that's at all indicative of where the majority is,'' Mr. Pitts said. Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, he said, ''That person's not going to get even a majority of the Republican primary voters.''\par \par \uc2 Better representations of South Carolina, Mr. Pitts said, were Ms. Haley's and Mr. Scott's huge election margins in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's opponents have tried to tap into the impulse toward inclusiveness among some Republicans here, particularly in the comparatively affluent retirement havens along the coast and in areas around major cities like Charleston and Columbia. Even before her endorsement of Mr. Rubio, Ms. Haley repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump as an angry and divisive figure. Senator \uc2 Lindsey Graham\uc2  of South Carolina, a mainstream Republican who supported an immigration overhaul, has castigated Mr. Trump as a racial divider who would doom the Republican Party as its nominee.\par \par \uc2 Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, has rebuked Mr. Trump insistently in his speeches for denigrating Hispanics and women. And his brother, former President George W. Bush, said at a campaign rally on Monday that he had been moved by South Carolina's response to the mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in June.\par \par \uc2 The shooting, which a young white supremacist is accused of carrying out, prompted Ms. Haley and state lawmakers to endorse the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the State House.\par \par \uc2 But the powerful advantage Mr. Trump holds here has remained a source of angst for Republicans. The primary race defined by his attacks has presented an uncomfortable contrast with the Democratic side of the presidential race, in which Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont have emphasized themes of racial justice in a fierce competition for black votes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has spoken dismissively about ''politically correct'' language and has called for a ban on Muslim immigration and for the deportations of millions of people who entered the country illegally. In South Carolina, his campaign is running a provocative commercial describing a murder in California, committed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and vowing to crack down on the country's southern border.\par \par \uc2 He has responded with contempt to Ms. Haley's criticism, and dismissed her as ''very, very weak on illegal immigration'' after she endorsed Mr. Rubio.\par \par \uc2 And Mr. Trump's campaign has drawn admiration from some unexpected quarters. State Representative Jenny Horne, a Republican who drew attention last summer with an impassioned speech urging the Confederate flag's removal, said in an interview that she admired Mr. Trump's outsider campaign and that he was among the candidates she might support on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 ''Nothing he's said is offensive to me,'' said Ms. Horne, who is running for Congress this year. ''The Trump phenomenon is a byproduct of many years of establishment candidates who, No. 1, don't tell the American people the truth and, No. 2, are totally disconnected from what Americans really care about.''\par \par \uc2 At Mr. Rubio's and Mr. Bush's midweek events in Summerville, there was considerably deeper unease about Mr. Trump's position in the state, and even voters who described themselves as sympathetic to his message said they ultimately recoiled from his slash-and-burn approach to politics.\par \par \uc2 ''In some ways, he comes across as being very redneck,'' said Margaret O'Brien, a Charleston retiree. ''Suppose he started talking like that to foreign leaders,'' she added. ''I don't think that it helps bring the country together to say bad things about anybody in the country.''\par \par \uc2 Andres Torres, a National Guard member studying at the Citadel, said Mr. Trump's campaign clashed with the progress South Carolina had made toward racial reconciliation.\par \par \uc2 ''Now, you can look at our senators, look at our governor, and see how much we've come along as a state,'' said Mr. Torres, 29, a native of Mount Pleasant. Still, he acknowledged, ''Looking outside of the big cities, it's Trump supporters.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160220ec2k0005x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Kennedy, the first Catholic president, have been forgotten, by \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2  no less.\par \par \uc2 At the height of the 1960 campaign, Kennedy's religion and the influence the Vatican might have on the conduct of his presidency if he was elected became a real issue in the campaign.\par \par \uc2 The future president said, ''I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute, where no Catholic prelate would tell the president (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote.''\par \par \uc2 This is exactly what \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2  did when, as you report, he suggested that Donald Trump ''is not Christian'' in proposing deportations and a wall to ward off migrants from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 It was improper for the pope to insert himself in the American electoral process, to the detriment of any particular candidate, in this case Mr. Trump, regardless of the pope's humanitarian concern for the plight of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 MICHAEL B. GOTKIN\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Our leaders love to cloak themselves in a Christian mantle but do not practice the most important tenet of Christian faith: Love your neighbor.\par \par \uc2 So \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2  has it right!\par \par \uc2 CHRISTA M.

Field on Immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS   \par \uc2 1,251 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 February 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. -- The Republican presidential race has erupted in an incendiary new round of attacks over immigration, laying the groundwork in South Carolina for a monthslong fight that is likely to amplify hard-line talk about border security and migrants before a national audience.\par \par \uc2 With \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  leading the way, the candidates have offered contentious proposals to build a wall on the Mexican border, block Muslims from entering the United States and turn away even 5-year-old refugees from Syria.\par \par \uc2 Party leaders had hoped some of the most provocative speech would have subsided by now as the race moved past Iowa, a state known for its fiercely hawkish immigration politics, and as more conventional candidates, like former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida, turned their attention toward the general election.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the battle lines over immigration have only deepened, as Mr. Trump has maintained his upper hand in the race and the primary campaign has moved into South Carolina and a series of Southern states that vote over the next month.\par \par \uc2 The theme of what conservatives call ''amnesty'' has divided the candidates into two groups: One, including Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, favors strict immigration policies that would never grant legal status to undocumented immigrants. The other, including Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush, who are both trailing in the polls, has endorsed a crackdown on illegal immigration without ruling out legal status for people in the country illegally at some distant point in the future.\par \par \uc2 Here in South Carolina, Mr. Cruz is airing a television ad attacking Mr. Rubio for his involvement in an attempted overhaul of the immigration system and branding him as having worked ''with liberal Chuck Schumer to give illegals amnesty.'' A ''super PAC'' supporting Mr. Cruz has sent campaign mail to voters here and in Nevada showing Mr. Rubio's face alongside those of Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and accusing Mr. Rubio of supporting ''amnesty.''\par \par \uc2 Kellyanne Conway, a strategist for the pro-Cruz group, Keep the Promise, said support for legalizing undocumented immigrants was a ''complete deal-breaker, an unpardonable sin, among the base.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Cruz, who won the Republican caucuses in Iowa in part on the strength of his immigration message, is also facing newly harsh criticism of his own record. A conservative advocacy group, the American Future Fund, is running commercials that say he ''proposed mass legalization of illegal immigrants,'' as part of a larger attack on Mr. Cruz's national security credentials.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslim immigration and for a special ''deportation force'' to expel undocumented immigrants, released an ad criticizing Mr. Cruz as untrustworthy on the issue. Mr. Trump later pulled the ad, but on Friday put out a different one highlighting the endorsement of Jamiel Shaw Sr., a man whose son was killed in California by a person the commercial describes as an ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gang member who just got out of prison.''\par \par \uc2 Heading into the debate on Saturday in Greenville, Mr. Rubio, who once championed an immigration bill that would have allowed undocumented workers to obtain legal status, insistently accused Mr. Cruz of being insincere in his support for punitive immigration restrictions.\par \par \uc2 At a campaign stop Thursday in Myrtle Beach, Mr. Rubio twice tied Mr. Cruz to more lenient positions on immigration that are unpopular here. When immigration was up for debate in Washington, Mr. Rubio said, ''Ted was a passionate spokesperson on behalf of legalizing people that are in this country illegally.''\par \par \uc2 Even Mr. Bush, who has taken a more empathetic view of illegal immigration -- he has called it an ''act of love'' for people seeking economic opportunity -- has circulated materials at campaign events that stress his stern approach to border security.\par \par \uc2 ''The first priority must be to Secure the Border,'' the leaflets say, with the final three words in bold type.\par \par \uc2 Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser to Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 's 2008 campaign, said immigration had become a symbolic litmus test on the right, locking the candidates into a protracted struggle, with potentially grave consequences for the fall campaign.\par \par \uc2 ''It's an authenticity fight -- who's the authentic conservative?'' said Mr. Holtz-Eakin, who advocated a bipartisan immigration deal in 2013. ''The difference is, immigration is a real issue, it's a large issue, and you can't escape that.''\par \par \uc2 Should Republicans enter the fall with a platform based on severe immigration restrictions, it would be the third consecutive presidential race in which the party has tacked to the right on the subject before facing an increasingly diverse national electorate, especially in swing states like Nevada, Florida and Virginia, where there are sizable Latino and Asian-American communities.\par \par \uc2 After the 2008 and 2012 elections, Republican leaders publicly called for the party to soften its platform on immigration. In the wake of \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's defeat by President Obama, a report commissioned by the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  concluded that supporting immigration reform was essential to the party's viability in national elections.\par \par \uc2 The gulf between the parties has opened even wider since then: As Republicans have taken a down-the-line conservative stance on immigration, Democrats have lurched still further to the left, and have criticized even the application of existing immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 In the Democratic debate on Thursday night, both Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont criticized Mr. Obama for deportation raids recently conducted by his administration.\par \par \uc2 But the stakes appear to be higher for the Republicans as they grapple with the perception that their party is hostile to immigrants and nonwhite voters.\par \par \uc2 Proponents of immigration reform have sought to raise the alarm about the trajectory of the Republican race. FWD.us, an organization that supports immigration reform, and is funded in part by the Facebook co-founder \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 , cited private polling to warn late last fall that support for large-scale deportation would be ''disastrous'' in a general election.\par \par \uc2 ''Any candidate who in the general supports mass deportation risks negatively impacting the brand of his or her party for generations to come,'' the group said in a memo circulated to allies in both parties.\par \par \uc2 In South Carolina, support for bipartisan immigration reform has not always proved politically toxic. Senator \uc2 Lindsey Graham\uc2 , a Republican who supports Mr. Bush, won re-election easily in 2014 after backing the same immigration compromise Mr. Rubio supported.\par \par \uc2 But voters here are plainly looking to the candidates for reassurance.\par \par \uc2 At a campaign stop Thursday in which Mr. Rubio criticized Mr. Cruz's immigration views from the right, Judy Phillips of North Myrtle Beach said some of her concerns about Mr. Rubio's record had been put to rest.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Phillips, who runs a small furniture business, said it had been important to hear Mr. Rubio's plans from him directly, after the barrage of immigration-themed ads that she had seen attacking him.\par \par \uc2 ''They keep running that ad about Schumer and him,'' Ms. Phillips said. ''I think that's a damaging ad.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Senator Marco Rubio spoke at the South Carolina Faith and Family Presidential Forum on Friday at Bob Jones University.

Beachy contributed research.   \par \uc2 3,413 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 February 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 He strolled into the police station in Chelsea on Jan. 4 wearing a Harvard sweatshirt, a ''Wounded Warrior'' cap and military dog tags dangling from his neck. He said he was Jeremiah Asimov-Beckingham, a veteran of Afghanistan, wounded in combat, now working as an executive for an airline. He had come to the station to pick up his car.\par \par \uc2 His new \uc2 BMW\uc2  had been impounded, he believed, as evidence in a random crime. But it was a ploy. The police were hoping to lure a man suspected of forging checks in Cambridge, Mass., to steal $70,000 and the \uc2 BMW\uc2 , which they had tracked to a Manhattan garage. They put Mr. Asimov-Beckingham in handcuffs and charged him with larceny.\par \par \uc2 Investigators soon learned that the man's name was not Asimov-Beckingham. He had never been wounded in combat, nor had he ever served in the military. New York detectives and Homeland Security agents found an Indiana birth certificate in his immigration file showing his name as Jeremy Wilson, born in Indianapolis in July 1973. It was the oldest document in the file, so they charged him under that name.\par \par \uc2 Still, his identity was a puzzle. He had spent 25 years stealing Social Security numbers and fabricating new aliases, leaving behind a thicket of confusing and falsified records. Six weeks earlier, he had been released from a federal prison in New Hampshire, where he had served six years for identity theft as Jeremy Clark-Erskine. But he had more than 27 aliases in five states. His birth certificate had been altered several times. Even his citizenship was in doubt. He had been deported more than once as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Now he is at Rikers Island, awaiting trial.\par \par \uc2 ''There is so much misinformation about me, no one can say with absolute certainty who I am,'' he said in an interview there late last month.\par \par \uc2 Further complicating matters, Mr. Wilson, 42, was now calling himself Jeremy Keenan and claiming to be the son of a famed Irish Republican Army leader, Brian Keenan, who directed the group's bombing campaign in Britain in the 1970s and later played a role in the peace process for Northern Ireland. (Mr. Keenan died in 2008.) Speaking with a light brogue, Mr. Wilson said he had evidence to prove his claim and hinted that he himself had been active in the I.R.A. in the 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Whatever his parentage, investigators say Mr. Wilson is a professional impostor and a skilled forger. Though fraud has become an increasingly invisible offense in a digital world, Mr. Wilson has stuck with a decidedly old-fashioned approach, stealing checks and creating new personas, occasionally with accents and falsified papers, the police said.\par \par \uc2 He has portrayed himself as a Scottish-born D.J., a Cambridge-trained thespian, a Special Forces officer and a professor at M.I.T. He has posed as executives from \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 , \uc2 British Airways\uc2  and Apple, always with a military background. He pretended to be a soldier seeking asylum in Canada to escape anti-Semitic attacks in the United States. He once maintained an Irish accent so well and for so long that his cellmate in an Indiana jail was convinced that he was an Irish mobster.\par \par \uc2 ''You have to give him some grudging respect,'' said Brian A. Clark, his cousin and also a victim, having had his identity stolen by Mr. Wilson in the early 1990s. ''He's a proper villain. He's just got flair.''\par \par \uc2 The exploits of Mr. Wilson -- if we can agree to call him that -- have drawn comparisons to those of Frank Abagnale Jr., the notorious con artist whose life was chronicled in the 2002 film ''Catch Me if You Can.''\par \par \uc2 He fits the profile of scammers who derive as much pleasure from hoodwinking others as they do from reaping a profit, said Louis B. Schlesinger, a professor of forensic psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. The elaborate fictions these swindlers spin tend to inflate their own egos. ''It's always grandiose,'' Professor Schlesinger said. ''It's always extraordinary.''\par \par \uc2 Criminals like Mr. Wilson also tend to lack empathy for their victims, experts said. ''That's their watch; it just happens to be on the other person's wrist,'' Mr. Schlesinger said. ''They see the world very differently than you do.''\par \par \uc2 His most embittered victims say he has a gift for lulling people into trusting him, even when their instincts tell them something is not right. His lies are detailed, and he backs them up with forged documents, checks, letters, passports, court orders.\par \par \uc2 Miryam Weisberg recalled how Mr. Wilson had convinced her that he was a former soldier from Boston who had done tours of duty in Afghanistan. He told vivid stories of barracks high jinks, camp life and combat, she said. ''He gave more detail than anybody that I'd ever known in the military,'' Ms. Weisberg said. She dated Mr. Wilson briefly in early 2006, just after he escaped from an Indiana prison. The romance ended when he stole her car and credit cards and fled to Canada.\par \par \uc2 A few months later, he was jailed in Edmonton, Alberta, after being caught stealing passports at a youth hostel. He contacted Larry Derkach, the director of Jewish Family Services in Edmonton, and claimed to be a Jewish soldier who had suffered violent anti-Semitic attacks in the \uc2 United States Army\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''The story, in some ways, was kind of far-fetched, but he has the gift of gab,'' said Mr. Derkach, who added, ''There were loads and loads of details that painted the story of a credible person in an unusual situation.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Derkach was so taken in that he let the G.I. stay at his home, something he has rarely done. In about three weeks, Mr. Wilson managed to have new credit cards issued to him on Mr. Derkach's account. Then he skipped town and ran up more than $17,000 worth of charges.\par \par \uc2 Almost a decade later, Mr. Derkach said he was still amazed by Mr. Wilson's raw intelligence. As they worked on his case for refugee status, he recalled, Mr. Wilson quickly memorized a complex legal document and could quote sizable chunks of it verbatim. ''I think he has genius capability,'' Mr. Derkach said.\par \par \uc2 His life of duplicity started early. His family in Indiana said he pulled his first con job while still at a Jesuit high school in Indianapolis, coming to class in a wheelchair to gain sympathy, then stealing from other students. He was expelled and lost a scholarship.\par \par \uc2 He grew up in a home where money was tight and father figures inconstant, family members said. His father, Lonnie Wilson, and his mother, Patricia Clark, split up when he was a toddler. His mother remarried, to John Erskine, a hotel manager, but it was a rocky union, and they separated more than once.\par \par \uc2 Not long after Mr. Wilson graduated from high school, his grandfather took him in and tried to mentor him because he kept running afoul of the law, having been arrested for stealing a crossbow and a car. He absconded with the older man's car and credit cards, wrecking the automobile in Colorado. ''He became persona non grata with the family after that,'' an uncle, Dr. Charles Clark, said.\par \par \uc2 It turned out that Mr. Wilson had taken more than the car. He also filched his cousin Brian Clark's Social Security number and assumed his identity, procuring drivers licenses and credit cards, even cashing a $2,000 check.\par \par \uc2 ''He is a con man and he knows what people don't ask questions about,'' Mr. Clark said. ''He is one of the smartest people I ever met.''\par \par \uc2 Given the number of times Mr. Wilson has been caught, it is hard to call his career a success. In the mid-1990s, he served prison sentences in Ohio and Pennsylvania for forgery and theft. Immigration authorities detained him for several months in 1999 and 2000 after he tried to enter Washington State from British Columbia and two forged passports -- one Irish and one Canadian -- were discovered in his car.\par \par \uc2 Then in 2001, he was sentenced to eight years in prison in Indiana after he was caught running up $7,400 in charges at strip clubs and hotels on credit cards he had obtained under a fictional identity. He had been posing as Duncan C. MacDonald, a \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  executive, court papers said.\par \par \uc2 In March 2006, he escaped from a work-release program in Indiana and fled to Canada, only to be recaptured in May 2007 as he tried to slip back into the United States to see his dying mother, family members said.\par \par \uc2 He was briefly released a year later but was rearrested in August 2008 after he checked into a luxury hotel in Indianapolis, court documents show. He had charged the room to an \uc2 Eli Lilly\uc2  corporate account; he had persuaded the company's accounting department over the telephone to give it to him.\par \par \uc2 Returned to jail in Indianapolis, Mr. Wilson spent his days doing push-ups on his knuckles and reading widely, devouring crime novels and newspapers. His cellmate at the time, Uriah Goins, recalled he was particularly interested in obituaries and death notices, which he would carefully tear out and stow away. He told Mr. Goins that he was ''looking for relatives.''\par \par \uc2 Even in jail, Mr. Wilson played a character, Mr. Goins said. He talked ceaselessly in an Irish accent, regaling Mr. Goins with stories of serving in the Irish military. ''He's like an actor,'' Mr. Goins said, pausing. ''He's definitely an actor.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Goins, a D.J. and promoter, said there was something vulnerable about Mr. Wilson. When Mr. Wilson was released, it was Mr. Goins who picked him up and helped him find a place to stay. A friend, Michael Lafferty, had an extra room and Mr. Goins introduced them.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lafferty said Mr. Wilson portrayed himself as a well-educated man, schooled at the \uc2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\uc2 , who had fallen on hard times and had a young child dying of cancer who wanted to see the Great Wall of China.\par \par \uc2 Three weeks later, Mr. Lafferty reported to the police that Mr. Wilson had run off with his credit card numbers, his Social Security number and an original birth certificate. Mr. Wilson fled to Chicago with a 19-year-old woman named Angela K. Stamm, whom he had met online through OK Cupid.\par \par \uc2 She said she believed Mr. Wilson's story that he was a recently discharged British soldier named Finn Keenan who was facing deportation. They stayed in Chicago for a month, where he tended bar, she said. Then he told her the government had ''found him.'' They drove west to Missoula, Mont., where he started calling himself Angus Jocko Ferguson.\par \par \uc2 They found a place to stay with Reid Reimers, a theater teacher. He bonded with Mr. Reimers and his friends over a shared love of theater. He claimed that he had studied at Cambridge in England, and he was well-versed in Shakespeare. Soon, Mr. Reimers recalled, he was serving as M.C. at events and joining in rehearsal.\par \par \uc2 ''He was -- again, not surprisingly now -- quite a good performer,'' Mr. Reimers recalled. ''The most disarming thing about him -- he was kind of a nerd. He had this silly laugh. It wasn't that he was charming or suave.''\par \par \uc2 He would disappear for days at a time, returning with duffel bags full of military gear and hinting about missions with a secretive commando force, said Mr. Reimers and Ms. Stamm, who now uses the surname Venado. But he was actually busy forging a new identity, investigators said. He had obtained a driver's license with his new alias, having switched Mr. Lafferty's Social Security number to Angus Ferguson with a forged court order in Chicago.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wilson also visited Fort Harrison, a Montana National Guard training site, in late August and tried to get a military ID card and body armor, telling officers there that he was a captain in the Special Forces on a secret mission, investigators said. One officer who spoke to him became suspicious and called the F.B.I., which put out an alert.\par \par \uc2 Not long after that, he was arrested as he tried to enter Malmstrom Air Force Base near Great Falls with Ms. Venado. An alert guard discovered that the car was stolen. When F.B.I. agents interviewed him at the Cascade County jail in Great Falls, Mr. Wilson stayed in character. ''He goes through the whole spiel about how he's in the Fifth Special Forces Group,'' Special Agent Ernesto L. Negron said.\par \par \uc2 Agent Negron noticed, however, that Mr. Wilson's patches were in the wrong places, and he could not recall his commander's name. Before the agent could check his fingerprints against a national database, he persuaded Mr. Reimers to post his bail and give him a ride back to Missoula. He packed his bags and left immediately, just an hour before agents knocked on the door, Ms. Venado said.\par \par \uc2 ''He kind of came clean, and said, 'I'm not in the Army Reserves and I need to leave,''' Ms. Venado recalled. ''I was totally freaked out and didn't know what to do. He asked me to come with him, but I said no. I didn't trust him anymore.''\par \par \uc2 He rented a second car -- a Mustang convertible this time -- and drove to Los Angeles, where he began posing as a Scottish D.J. and video producer with the unlikely name of Angus Jocko Ferguson-Abramovitch, according to court documents. He also pretended to be a veteran who worked for Apple, persuading a Beverly Hills dentist to do $28,000 worth of work. He was finally arrested in January 2010 because the Mustang was towed. A pound worker alerted the Culver City, Calif., police that it was on a list of stolen cars.\par \par \uc2 In New York, Mr. Wilson is charged with forgery and possession of stolen property. He also faces charges in Cambridge, where the police say he set up a bank account under the name Jeremiah Asimov-Beckingham with a forged driver's license, Social Security card and military discharge papers, then deposited more than $70,000 worth of checks drawn on the account of a local design company. He had lifted one of the company's checks from a mailbox and printed checks with the same account number. He used the stolen funds to make the first payment on a leased \uc2 BMW\uc2 , then absconded to New York City.\par \par \uc2 On a recent morning, Mr. Wilson walked into a chapel on Rikers Island, wearing a khaki prison uniform. His head was shaved and he wore a short red beard. He was fit and compact, and looked young for 42. His body was adorned with Celtic tattoos. On the back of his head was a dent, a scar he claimed had been caused by a rubber bullet. He greeted visitors with a disarming smile and spoke in an educated voice that dropped in and out of an Irish brogue.\par \par \uc2 ''People have a tendency not just to believe people, but to want to believe people,'' he said when asked how he deceived his victims. ''And that's part of the wrong in the things that I have done, because I take that away from people.''\par \par \uc2 He spoke candidly about his past crimes but would not comment on the new charges against him. He feels no remorse, he said, for ripping off credit card companies and banks, but he is sorry for fooling people who befriended him. Every friendship in his life was built on lies and half-truths, he said, and they all ended with him running away, often with his friends' personal information in his pocket.\par \par \uc2 ''That's the evil behind everything I have done,'' he said. ''I get involved with people who don't deserve the betrayal that's bound to come.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wilson consented to the interview, he said, because he had spent his whole life trying to obscure his identity and now wanted to reveal who he really was. He said his father was not Lonnie Wilson, the men's store manager his mother married, but Mr. Keenan, the I.R.A. leader, with whom, he said, his mother had an affair in Northern Ireland in 1972.\par \par \uc2 It is not an entirely new claim. He first tried to argue that Mr. Keenan was his father in 2011, when he filed a lawsuit in prison asking a federal judge to declare that he was not an American citizen. At the time he was seeking to be deported.\par \par \uc2 The next year, he tried to convince his own sister, Mary Katharine Rybak. During prison visits, he showed her a notarized letter, supposedly written by their mother, to back up his claim of being Mr. Keenan's son. She noticed their mother's signature was not right. ''I think he doesn't know where the lies stop and the truth starts anymore,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Ure, an immigration lawyer in San Diego, said Mr. Wilson had hired him to help with his effort to be sent to Britain. In 2012, Mr. Ure said, he received DNA samples via courier that according to accompanying documents, had been taken years earlier from Mr. Keenan, Mr. Wilson and his mother. Mr. Ure had the samples tested at a California laboratory, and the results proved conclusively Mr. Keenan was Mr. Wilson's father, the lawyer said. ''If his story is not true, he's done a lot of work to make it seem true,'' Mr. Ure said.\par \par \uc2 But like everything in Mr. Wilson's world, there is doubt, this time about the origin of the samples. The documents claimed that a British company, DNA Worldwide Group Ltd., had collected the samples in 2006 and then handed them over to officials at the \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2  for safekeeping. The genetics company said, however, that it had no record of having done so, and its representatives said they do not recognize the documents.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wilson said that he developed a long-distance relationship with Mr. Keenan and later involved himself in I.R.A. operations from 1993 to 1999. He provided no details. During that period, records show he was in and out of prisons in Ohio and Pennsylvania, spending only about 12 months free.\par \par \uc2 His reasons for bringing up his father's identity had little to do with his current legal predicament, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''I want to go home -- I want to go to Ireland,'' he said. ''If I'm going to be hated, I want to be hated for the right reasons. I'm so tired of this.\par \par \uc2 ''I am tired of feeling I have to lie to every single human being that I meet about the things that I have done and who I am,'' he went on. ''Because the truth is worse than the lies. The things I have done are worse than the lies I have told.''\par \par \uc2 He put his hands to his face and covered his eyes. Tattooed across his fingers in green ink is a Gaelic phrase, ''Mair Fior.'' He says it means ''Stay True.''\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Wilson during an interview Jan. 29 at Rikers Island.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DES MOINES -- Iowa Democrats are displaying far less passion for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  than for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont three weeks before the presidential caucuses, creating anxiety inside the Clinton campaign as she scrambles to energize supporters and to court wavering voters.\par \par \uc2 The enthusiasm gap spilled abundantly into view in recent days, from the cheering crowds and emotional outpourings that greeted Mr. Sanders, and in interviews with more than 50 Iowans at campaign stops for both candidates.\par \par \uc2 Voters have mobbed Mr. Sanders at events since Friday, some jumping over chairs to shake his hand or snap a selfie. ''Did you get to touch him?'' asked one woman who could not get close enough after an event here on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 ''We love you, Bernie! Enough is enough!'' Nathan Arentsen, 29, cheered at another event in Des Moines, stamping his feet emphatically.\par \par \uc2 With a new poll showing Mr. Sanders surging ahead in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton and her aides have dropped any pretense that they can ignore Mr. Sanders or treat him like a gadfly. They have become zealous and combative as they try new ways to undercut his high favorability ratings\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Mrs. Clinton proposed raising the income tax by four percentage points for people earning more than $5 million a year, an idea virtually out of the Sanders playbook. At the same time, she is aggressively challenging Mr. Sanders on gun control and health care, undertaking relentless attacks on Mr. Sanders that can feel somewhat forced, like portraying him as an ally of the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton even mocked Mr. Sanders at one point, imitating his defense for supporting a bill shielding gun manufacturers and dealers from liability. ''He says, 'Well, I'm from Vermont,' '' Mrs. Clinton noted before saying that home-state concerns were not a sufficient explanation.\par \par \uc2 She is also trying to tap into the popularity of President Obama by embracing his record, and she is dispatching former President \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  here on Friday for the second time in two weeks -- after insisting for months that she was not running for a third term for either man.\par \par \uc2 Clinton advisers said they believed Iowa was a single-digit race and have been warning supporters against complacency, admitting that Mr. Sanders's operation in the state was better financed and organized than they had expected. On Saturday, they began trying to undercut his electability with a television ad casting Mrs. Clinton as the strongest possible Democratic nominee, even though some polls show Mr. Sanders would also perform well against Republicans like \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 An event Monday in Waterloo underscored Mrs. Clinton's challenge: About 300 people welcomed her enthusiastically and listened to her diligently, but many of them, still unsure, rebuffed Clinton aides trying to get them to sign ''commitment cards'' to caucus for her.\par \par \uc2 ''I personally want to find out if she's trustworthy or not,'' said Katie Bailey, 71, of Cedar Falls. ''There's so much untrust. I want to eyeball her.''\par \par \uc2 Matt Fagerlind, 36, also attended the Clinton event, but found himself thinking about how Mr. Sanders's rallies had the same uplifting emotional intensity as \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's in 2008. ''I think Sanders is going to give her a good run,'' he said, describing himself as unmoved by Mrs. Clinton and planning to vote for Mr. Sanders.\par \par \uc2 (Ultimately, a Clinton aide said, about half of the audience signed commitment cards.)\par \par \uc2 A Sanders victory in Iowa would be a shock, given the institutional advantages held by Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state and a favorite of the Iowa Democratic establishment. It would also set off significant momentum for Mr. Sanders heading into the Feb. 9 primary in New Hampshire, where he holds a slight lead in the polls.\par \par \uc2 Several of Mrs. Clinton's advisers, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the race candidly, said that they were anxious but not panicking about Iowa and that they believed she would still deliver a victory here.\par \par \uc2 Still, some advisers said they were torn about whether the campaign would ultimately regret purposely holding small events in Iowa -- a strategy Mrs. Clinton preferred -- given Mr. Sanders's ability to continue to turn out and energize crowds, which they had not anticipated.\par \par \uc2 Some members of her Iowa team, however, said they were confident that passion for Mrs. Clinton was intensifying.\par \par \uc2 ''It's something that's growing closer to caucus day,'' said Kane Miller, the Clinton campaign's organizing director for Polk County, which includes Des Moines. ''This previous weekend was negative degrees, and 80 percent of people confirmed to volunteer were out knocking on doors. That's a great measure of enthusiasm.''\par \par \uc2 Both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton garnered applause on Monday night at the Brown and Black Forum at \uc2 Drake University\uc2  here, though the crowd seemed more delighted with Mr. Sanders as he denounced a 51 percent unemployment rate for black men with a high school education and joked that he would consider living in the White House to be public housing.\par \par \uc2 The warmth for Mr. Sanders was notable because of Mrs. Clinton's historical popularity among minority voters, particularly African-Americans. She drew cheers for saying she would not use the term ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' and for pledging to help Central American countries stem the violence that people there flee.\par \par \uc2 A poll published on Tuesday, by \uc2 Quinnipiac University\uc2  , found that Mr. Sanders had jumped to a lead in Iowa, with 49 percent to Mrs. Clinton's 44 percent, after trailing her by 11 points in mid-December. The Quinnipiac poll also found that liberal Iowans were the most enthusiastic about the election, and that Mr.Sanders was the favorite among these voters. A New York Times/CBS News poll released on Tuesday showed Mrs. Clinton's once formidable lead shrinking from 20 points a month ago to seven points.\par \par \uc2 The tightened race is revealing a sharp generational divide within the Democratic Party, with primary voters under age 45 favoring Mr. Sanders by a roughly 2-to-1 ratio.\par \par \uc2 The Clinton campaign still has significant structural advantages in Iowa to help turn out caucus voters. The state's most popular Democrats have endorsed Mrs. Clinton, including former Senator Tom Harkin and former Gov. Tom Vilsack, helping her leverage their political networks. She also has endorsements from unions and groups like the \uc2 Planned Parenthood Action Fund\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Advisers for Mrs. Clinton say they have strong organizations in the most populous counties and have compiled data on tens of thousands of Democrats, many of whom who are receiving phone calls or visits from teams of volunteers who crowd field offices like Mr. Miller's. Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, is also a veteran of caucus contests, while strategists like Joel Benenson were part of Mr. Obama's campaign in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders's supporters point to his grass-roots strengths: He has more than 14,000 volunteers in Iowa, and he has spoken to more than 40,000 people at events in the state so far, huge numbers that include young people, independents and new voters who might not be on pollsters' call sheets. (Mrs. Clinton's advisers declined to say how many volunteers she had or people she had spoken to in Iowa.)\par \par \uc2 ''I think his secret weapon, maybe his silver bullet even, is the young adult population that hasn't been involved in politics up until this point,'' said Katie Mitchell, 28, a middle school teacher who lives in Des Moines.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton's campaign is trying to shore up her base among female voters: Lena Dunham, the star of the HBO series ''Girls,'' was deployed on Saturday to make a feminist pitch for Mrs. Clinton to crowds of mostly young women in Iowa. Yet many younger women who gathered did not share Ms. Dunham's visceral enthusiasm for Mrs. Clinton, saying that for most of their lives she has been a familiar fixture of establishment politics rather than an exciting new voice or an agent of change.\par \par \uc2 ''Bernie Sanders feels new, and Hillary seems like a Washington insider,'' said Laura Cornell, 17, who was encouraged by friends to hear Ms. Dunham's pitch but remained committed to Mr. Sanders.\par \par \uc2 Many of the Sanders supporters interviewed said they felt personally moved by what they described as his sincerity. Bert Permar, 86, a retired professor, said he had gone to four Sanders events and was now making calls to share the candidate's message.\par \par \uc2 ''I love to see him. He motivates me,'' Mr. Permar said on Sunday, sitting in the front row at a Sanders forum on veterans' issues in Marshalltown. ''I get emotional. It brings tears that someone is talking about the issues that we should be concerned about.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2  , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont greeting supporters in Ankeny, Iowa, on Sunday.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- A Syrian refugee, a former \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who went on to serve in the \uc2 United States Army\uc2  and the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case last year legalizing same-sex marriage will be among the official guests on Tuesday as President Obama delivers his final State of the Union address.\par \par \uc2 The three men -- Refaai Hamo, Oscar Vazquez and Jim Obergefell -- will be joined by almost 20 other members of the armed services and civilians associated with the issues and initiatives that have defined Mr. Obama's presidency, and that he hopes will become his legacy.\par \par \uc2 The White House announced Mr. Obama's full guest list on Sunday for an address to a joint session of Congress that officials said would focus more on the issues and challenges that are shaping the future of the country than specific policy proposals.\par \par \uc2 The guests are intended to illustrate ''who we are as Americans: inclusive and compassionate, innovative and courageous,'' according to the White House announcement. The invitees -- some high profile, most conspicuously not -- will sit in the House gallery with Michelle Obama, the first lady.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hamo, a scientist who fled Syria amid civil war, settled with four of his children in Troy, Mich., on Dec. 18. After the Humans of New York, a photo blog, featured his story, readers donated more than $450,000 to support the family, and Mr. Obama publicly welcomed him to the country.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obergefell, a real estate agent from Cincinnati, sued the State of Ohio, which had outlawed same-sex marriage, and ended up as the lead plaintiff on the Supreme Court case that in June guaranteed gay couples across the country the right to marry.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Vazquez, who was brought to the United States illegally as a child and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in engineering in 2009, decided to return to his home country of Mexico and re-enter the country legally. When he returned to the United States, Mr. Vazquez joined the Army and served one tour of duty in Afghanistan, eventually earning American citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The president's other guests include the chief executive of Microsoft, \uc2 Satya Nadella\uc2 , whose company has pledged millions in education funding and increased paid leave for its employees, and Sue Ellen Allen, a former Arizona inmate who founded an organization that supports incarcerated and released women there.\par \par \uc2 Two of the guests have ties to Mr. Obama from his first presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 One of them, Edith Childs, was a county councilwoman in Greenwood, S.C., when she met Mr. Obama in 2007 on the campaign trail and delivered what became an unofficial slogan in his two presidential campaigns: ''Fired up! Ready to go!'' The other, Earl Smith, gave the president a military patch that he had worn in Vietnam and that Mr. Obama carried with him for the rest of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Three guests, including \uc2 Gov. Dannel P. Malloy\uc2  of Connecticut, have links to the Affordable Care Act, which remains a divisive issue almost six years after its passage. Others have links to other priorities of Mr. Obama's, like gun control, criminal justice reform and climate change.\par \par \uc2 Staff Sgt. Spencer Stone of the Air Force, who helped take down a gunman on a train in France in August, will also join Mrs. Obama in the box, where the White House elected to leave one seat empty to represent victims of gun violence in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Follow the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160111ec1b00054\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Merrill, Kitty Bennett and John Corrales contributed reporting.   \par \uc2 2,065 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 December 2015\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ''Something bad is happening,'' \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  warned New Hampshire voters Tuesday night, casting suspicions on Muslims and mosques. ''Something really dangerous is going on.''\par \par \uc2 On Thursday evening, his message was equally ominous, as he suggested a link between the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., and President Obama's failure to say ''radical Islamic terrorism.''\par \par \uc2 ''There is something going on with him that we don't know about,'' Mr. Trump said of the president, drawing applause from the crowd in Washington.\par \par \uc2 The dark power of words has become the defining feature of Mr. Trump's bid for the White House to a degree rarely seen in modern politics, as he forgoes the usual campaign trappings -- policy, endorsements, commercials, donations -- and instead relies on potent language to connect with, and often stoke, the fears and grievances of Americans.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  analyzed every public utterance by Mr. Trump over the past week from rallies, speeches, interviews and news conferences to explore the leading candidate's hold on the Republican electorate for the past five months. The transcriptions yielded 95,000 words and several powerful patterns, demonstrating how Mr. Trump has built one of the most surprising political movements in decades and, historians say, echoing the appeals of some demagogues of the past century.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's breezy stage presence makes him all the more effective because he is not as off-putting as those raging men of the past, these experts say.\par \par \uc2 The most striking hallmark was Mr. Trump's constant repetition of divisive phrases, harsh words and violent imagery that American presidents rarely use, based on a quantitative comparison of his remarks and the news conferences of recent presidents, Democratic and Republican. He has a particular habit of saying ''you'' and ''we'' as he inveighs against a dangerous ''them'' or unnamed other -- usually outsiders like illegal immigrants (''they're pouring in''), Syrian migrants (''young, strong men'') and Mexicans, but also leaders of both political parties.\par \par \uc2 At an event in Raleigh, N.C., on Friday evening, his voice scratchy and hoarse, Mr. Trump was asked by a 12-year-old girl from Virginia, ''I'm scared -- what are you going to do to protect this country?''\par \par \uc2 ''You know what, darling? You're not going to be scared anymore. They're going to be scared. You're not going to be scared,'' Mr. Trump said, before describing the Sept. 11 terrorists as ''animals'' who sent their families back to the Middle East. ''We never went after them. We never did anything. We have to attack much stronger. We have to be more vigilant. We have to be much tougher. We have to be much smarter, or it's never, ever going to end.''\par \par \uc2 While many candidates appeal to the passions and patriotism of their crowds, Mr. Trump appears unrivaled in his ability to forge bonds with a sizable segment of Americans over anxieties about a changing nation, economic insecurities, ferocious enemies and emboldened minorities (like the first black president, whose heritage and intelligence he has all but encouraged supporters to malign).\par \par \uc2 '' 'We vs. them' creates a threatening dynamic, where 'they' are evil or crazy or ignorant and 'we' need a candidate who sees the threat and can alleviate it,'' said Matt Motyl, a political psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago who is studying how the 2016 presidential candidates speak. ''He appeals to the masses and makes them feel powerful again: 'We' need to build a wall on the Mexican border -- not 'I,' but 'we.' ''\par \par \uc2 In another pattern, Mr. Trump tends to attack a person rather than an idea or a situation, like calling political opponents ''stupid'' (at least 30 times), ''horrible'' (14 times), ''weak'' (13 times) and other names, and criticizing foreign leaders, journalists and so-called anchor babies. He bragged on Thursday about psyching out Jeb Bush by repeatedly calling him ''low-energy,'' but he spends far less time contrasting Mr. Bush's policies with his own proposals, which are scant.\par \par \uc2 And on Friday night in Raleigh, he mocked people who reportedly did not contact the authorities with concerns about the California shooting suspects for fear of racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 ''Can anybody be that dumb?'' Mr. Trump said. ''We have become so politically correct that we don't know what the hell we're doing. We don't know what we're doing.''\par \par \uc2 The specter of violence looms over much of his speech, which is infused with words like kill, destroy and fight. For a man who speaks off the cuff, he always remembers to bring up the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2 's ''chopping off heads.'' And he has expressed enthusiasm for torturing enemies beyond waterboarding. Last month, after several men hit a Black Lives Matter protester at one of his rallies, Mr. Trump said, ''Maybe he should have been roughed up.''\par \par \uc2 ''Such statements and accusations make him seem like a guy who can and will cut through all the b.s. and do what in your heart you know is right -- and necessary,'' said Michael Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University, echoing the slogan that Barry Goldwater used in his 1964 presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 And Mr. Trump uses rhetoric to erode people's trust in facts, numbers, nuance, government and the news media, according to specialists in political rhetoric. ''Nobody knows,'' he likes to declare, where illegal immigrants are coming from or the rate of increase of health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act, even though government agencies collect and publish this information. He insists that Mr. Obama wants to accept 250,000 Syrian migrants, even though no such plan exists, and repeats discredited rumors that thousands of Muslims were cheering in New Jersey during the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He promises to ''bomb the hell'' out of enemies -- invoking Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- and he says he would attack his political opponents ''10 times as hard'' as they criticize him.\par \par \uc2 (Mr. Trump, who also pledges to build up the military to show American toughness, will hold a rally on Monday on the aircraft carrier Yorktown in South Carolina to commemorate the anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.)\par \par \uc2 And as much as he likes the word ''attack,'' the Times analysis shows, he often uses it to portray himself as the victim of cable news channels and newspapers that, he says, do not show the size of his crowds.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump declined a request to be interviewed for this article.\par \par \uc2 This pattern of elevating emotional appeals over rational ones is a rhetorical style that historians, psychologists and political scientists placed in the tradition of political figures like Goldwater, George Wallace, Joseph McCarthy, Huey Long and Pat Buchanan, who used fiery language to try to win favor with struggling or scared Americans. Several historians watched Mr. Trump's speeches last week, at the request of The Times, and observed techniques -- like vilifying groups of people and stoking the insecurities of his audiences -- that they associate with Wallace and McCarthy.\par \par \uc2 ''His entire campaign is run like a demagogue's -- his language of division, his cult of personality, his manner of categorizing and maligning people with a broad brush,'' said Jennifer Mercieca, an expert in American political discourse at Texas A&M University. ''If you're an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , you're a loser. If you're captured in war, like \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , you're a loser. If you have a disability, you're a loser. It's rhetoric like Wallace's -- it's not a kind or generous rhetoric.''\par \par \uc2 ''And then there are the winners, most especially himself, with his repeated references to his wealth and success and intelligence,'' said Ms. Mercieca, noting a particular remark of Mr. Trump's on Monday in Macon, Ga. (''When you're really smart, when you're really, really smart like I am -- it's true, it's true, it's always been true, it's always been true.'')\par \par \uc2 ''Part of his argument is that if you believe in American exceptionalism, you should vote for me,'' Ms. Mercieca said.\par \par \uc2 Historically, demagogues have flourished when they tapped into the grievances of citizens and then identified and maligned outside foes, as McCarthy did with attacking Communists, Wallace with pro-integration northerners and Mr. Buchanan with cultural liberals. These politicians used emotional language -- be it ''segregation forever'' or accusatory questions over the Communist Party -- to persuade Americans to pin their anxieties about national security, jobs, racial diversity and social trends on enemy forces.\par \par \uc2 A significant difference between Mr. Trump and 20th-century American demagogues is that many of them, especially McCarthy and Wallace, were charmless public speakers. Mr. Trump, by contrast, is an energetic and charismatic speaker who can be entertaining and ingratiating with his audiences. There is a looseness to his language that sounds almost like water-cooler talk or neighborly banter, regardless of what it is about.\par \par \uc2 For some historians, this only makes him more effective, because demagogy is more palatable when it is leavened with a smile and joke. Highlighting that informality, one of his most frequently used words is ''guy'' -- which he said 91 times last week and has used to describe President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a stranger cheering him on at a rally and a celebrity friend.\par \par \uc2 ''His relaxed, jokey tone makes statements about his resolve to solve every problem because he knows what's right and has the energy to do it more persuasive,'' said Mr. Kazin of Georgetown, who described Mr. Trump's idea for a database of Muslims in the United States as insidious but also said he found Mr. Trump amusing at points.\par \par \uc2 Over many decades, Mr. Trump's career as both a real estate developer and a celebrity has been infused with language described as divisive, even racially charged. In the 1980s, it was with advertisements condemning the young men, four of them black and one Latino, accused of marauding through Central Park and raping a jogger. Just over a decade ago, it was the controversy during the first season of his reality show ''The Apprentice,'' in which he played a boardroom billionaire who fired people. He and other cast members clashed with Omarosa Manigault, a black woman who claimed someone had called her a racial slur and suggested that Mr. Trump had been insensitive.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has said he will tear into anyone who tries to take him on, and he presents himself as someone who is always right in his opinions -- even prophetic, a visionary. He repeatedly insists that he alone predicted the rise of Osama bin Laden in 2001 (despite the fact that the Bin Laden network had attacked two United States embassies and the U.S.S. Cole in the three years before). ''I said, 'We better be careful, that's gonna happen, it's gonna be a big thing,' and it certainly is a big thing,'' Mr. Trump has said of what he wrote about the Al Qaeda leader in 2000.\par \par \uc2 It is the sort of trust-me-and-only-me rhetoric that, according to historians, demagogues have used to insist that they have unique qualities that can lead the country through turmoil. Mr. Trump often makes that point when he criticizes his Republican rivals, though he also pretends that he is not criticizing them.\par \par \uc2 ''All of 'em are weak, they're just weak,'' Mr. Trump said in New Hampshire on Tuesday of his fellow candidates. ''I think they're weak, generally, you want to know the truth. But I won't say that, because I don't want to get myself, I don't want to have any controversies. So I refuse to say that they're weak generally, O.K.? Some of them are fine people. But they are weak.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 At the very first out-of-town performance of ''On Your Feet!,'' the new Broadway musical about Gloria and Emilio Estefan, the pattern was established: The audience erupted in cheers when an angry Mr. Estefan rebuked a hostile record company executive, saying, ''You should look very closely at my face, because whether you know it or not ... this is what an American looks like.''\par \par \uc2 In ''Hamilton,'' the hip-hop musical about America's founding fathers, the lyric ''Immigrants/We get the job done,'' is such a reliable applause line that the creators have lengthened the pause that follows to allow time for the sound to die down.\par \par \uc2 And in ''Allegiance,'' a new show inspired by the life of the ''Star Trek'' star George Takei, a group of young Japanese-American men born in California insistently sing ''We are Americans'' when their efforts to enlist in the United States military during World War II are rejected by a recruiter who deems them ''enemy aliens.''\par \par \uc2 Immigration has emerged as a sharply divisive issue in the ongoing presidential campaign -- this week Republican candidates sparred during and after a debate over who would be tougher on illegal immigrants, President Obama criticized \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2 's proposal for a ''deportation force,'' and Democratic candidates were expected to argue over the topic at their own debate on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 On Broadway, however, immigration is something to sing about.\par \par \uc2 ''It does point to a new awareness about immigrant stories, and it stands in such sharp contrast to certain Republicans' point of view,'' said Jenny Gersten, a member of the Tony Awards nominating committee. ''It speaks to how many of us are immigrants -- very few of us go back to Plymouth Rock, and even they were immigrants -- and you do feel a cheer swell up in you both for the characters and for your own ancestors' back story.''\par \par \uc2 It takes years for a new musical to get to Broadway, meaning that the current shows were begun well before the campaign got underway. But the audiences can't help but hear the lines in the context of current events -- Lin-Manuel Miranda has said that he believes the enthusiasm for the phrasing in ''Hamilton,'' which he created, has been heightened by Mr. Trump's anti-immigrant comments.\par \par \uc2 Polls suggest that Americans are generally sympathetic to immigration but divided over what to do about illegal immigrants, and there are partisan differences over the issue.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 CBS News\uc2  poll this summer found that Democrats overwhelmingly said most recent immigrants contribute to this country, while Republicans were less persuaded. And a New York Times/CBS News poll found that a plurality of Republicans -- 45 percent -- believe that illegal immigrants should be required to leave the country, while 72 percent of Democrats would allow them to stay and apply for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 On Broadway, however, there is no debate, reflecting the ideological tilt of creators and audiences, and the sympathetic, and often historical, context in which the immigration issue is framed.\par \par \uc2 ''The Broadway audience, in general, is several clicks to the left of an audience in Oklahoma City -- generally more liberal, and more inclusive -- and people going to see Broadway shows aren't there to be challenged,'' said Jeffrey Eric Jenkins, a theater professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\par \par \uc2 Broadway shows also are not dealing with sharp edges of the contemporary immigration debate. There are musicals in the works about illegal immigration -- Quiara Alegr\u237\'00\'EDa Hudes, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, is working on a musical about the relationship between an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and her American-born daughter -- but most shows dealing with the issue are presented Off Broadway and beyond.\par \par \uc2 ''It's hard to imagine a successful Broadway musical about undocumented farmworkers,'' said Rachel Rubin, a professor of American studies at University of Massachusetts Boston who has written about depictions of immigration in popular culture.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants and their children were important figures behind Broadway's earliest musicals, and Broadway shows have explored immigration and American identity for decades. In 1922, ''Abie's Irish Rose'' showed the tensions over assimilation in Jewish and Irish families; in 1957, ''West Side Story'' included a song about discrimination, ''America,'' that featured the lyric ''Nobody knows in America/Puerto Rico's in America!''\par \par \uc2 ''There have always been treatments of immigration on Broadway, but at the beginning it was drawn from contemporary headlines, and now it's looking back, which is a big switch,'' Ms. Rubin said. She pointed out that for decades, immigrants onstage were predominantly European -- Jews, Italians, Irish -- and that depictions of immigrants from Asia, Latin America and Africa are a newer phenomenon. ''Who we see as immigrants changes, and who we're happy to see as immigrants changes,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 The new shows arrive on Broadway during a season of unusual diversity in subject matter and casts, as the immigration that has reshaped American demographics is starting to reshape Broadway stories.\par \par \uc2 And the subject is personal for many of those involved in the shows. Many members of the cast and crew of ''On Your Feet!'' are immigrants or the children of immigrants -- the choreographer, Sergio Trujillo, immigrated illegally from Colombia to Canada before making his way to the United States, and the star, Ana Villafa\u241\'00\'F1e, is the daughter of a Salvadoran father and a Cuban-American mother.\par \par \uc2 ''Time and again, it is immigrants who tell us what America is -- they embody the optimism of America even when America doesn't keep its promises,'' said Mark Acito, one of the writers of ''Allegiance.''\par \par \uc2 Alexander Dinelaris, the Oscar-winning screenwriter who wrote the book for ''On Your Feet!,'' said that even when writing about historical events, artists can't help but be influenced by contemporary issues.\par \par \uc2 ''We're carrying our feelings with us -- taking our writers' minds from 2015 and bringing our view from here, and that's what we're seeing now,'' said Mr. Dinelaris, whose grandparents were from Cuba, Puerto Rico and Armenia.\par \par \uc2 He said he didn't realize until the show began a pre-Broadway run what a crowd-pleaser Mr. Estefan's patriotic retort to the record producer would be.\par \par \uc2 ''I had written it two years ago, well before Trump and all that business, and it wasn't on my mind how it would hit the zeitgeist,'' he said. ''Once we got to Chicago, the first audience burst into applause, and we thought, Wow, that's resonating.''\par \par \uc2 From left, two Broadway musicals that touch on immigration: ''On Your Feet!,'' about Gloria and Emilio Estefan, and ''Allegiance,'' inspired by the life of the ''Star Trek'' star George Takei.

HOLSON   \par \uc2 529 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 November 2015\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco elected its first female sheriff on Tuesday: Vicki Hennessy, a city native who pledged to work with the whole criminal justice system -- including the police, the district attorney's office and federal immigration officials -- to build better relationships.\par \par \uc2 ''We have to sit down and work as a community,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hennessy will succeed Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, whose four-year term was marked by personal scandals, confrontations with Mayor Edwin M. Lee, and -- perhaps most dramatically -- the release of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in his jail who had several felonies.\par \par \uc2 The felon he released, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, had been deported to Mexico five times and, after winning freedom here, proceeded to shoot a tourist named Kathryn Steinle to death on a pier on the Embarcadero waterfront. The issue prompted San Francisco to re-examine -- and reaffirm -- its commitment to being a sanctuary city, one that shields immigrants from deportation.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hennessy, who was backed by the mayor, said she would take a more inclusive approach in working with federal immigration officials, reviewing on a ''case-by-case basis'' whether to notify them when an unauthorized immigrant with a criminal record was due for release.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hennessy said she did not have a political agenda but wanted to bring a sense of calm back to the Sheriff's Department; many of Mr. Mirkarimi's deputies had campaigned for her and against him. She takes office in January.\par \par \uc2 ''I was an executive and manager for 25 years,'' she said. ''We are going to agree to disagree, but we will get things done together.''\par \par \uc2 She and her supporters gathered at Don Ramon's restaurant on Tuesday at a party attended by Mr. Lee, a Democrat, who was re-elected. Ms. Hennessy, 62, was born and raised in San Francisco and joined the Sheriff's Department in 1975; her husband is a retired San Francisco police officer.\par \par \uc2 In the Sheriff's Department, she became the youngest captain in 1983, and, in 1997, was promoted to chief deputy. This was her first run for political office.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hennessy said that she did not see herself as an activist like Mr. Mirkarimi, but as more of an executive and administrator.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm open to ideas,'' she said. ''I don't have to be the one to come up with them.''\par \par \uc2 In 2008, she was appointed by Mayor \uc2 Gavin Newsom\uc2 , now the lieutenant governor of California, to be the director of the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management, overseeing emergency response teams for the Police and Fire Departments. And in 2012, she was appointed interim sheriff when Mr. Mirkarimi was suspended after a domestic dispute with his wife.\par \par \uc2 This summer Mr. Mirkarimi announced that the department would allow transgender prisoners to be housed in jail according to the gender with which they identify. This caused consternation among deputies who said that they had not had enough involvement in determining how the policy would work.\par \par \uc2 ''We have to set that up so it works well for us,'' Ms. Hennessy said.\par \par \uc2 Vicki Hennessy   \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020151105ebb50007o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OTTAWA -- He was a teenage refugee, fleeing civil war in Somalia, when he came to Canada 22 years ago. Now, after completing high school and earning degrees in history and law, Ahmed Hussen is about to be sworn in as a member of Parliament -- one of 46 nonwhite candidates elected to the House of Commons on Oct. 19, most of them immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ''Even as recently as two years ago, if you asked, 'Would you ever become an M.P. in Canada?' I would say, 'Impossible,' '' said Mr. Hussen, 39, a Liberal who will represent a Toronto constituency. ''It speaks well of Canadians that they're willing to vote for a person based on his views and his platform, not where they come from.''\par \par \uc2 Many factors contributed to the sweeping victory last month by the Liberals, whose leader, Justin Trudeau, will take office as prime minister on Wednesday. But several analysts said that one of the most important factors was the immigration and refugee policies of the losing Conservative government.\par \par \uc2 In a country that generally prizes immigrants as a source of economic growth and officially encourages newcomers to maintain their ethnic identities, the Conservatives and Prime Minister Stephen Harper were widely seen as anti-Muslim, especially after they made an issue of the face coverings worn by some Muslim women.\par \par \uc2 ''The Conservative government tried to use wedge politics, but in the end, it backfired,'' said Andrew Griffith, a former director general of the government office that oversees citizenship matters and the author of a book about multiculturalism in Canada. ''It should give any political party in Canada food for thought, food for reflection.''\par \par \uc2 The move was uncharacteristic even for the Conservatives, who assiduously courted immigrant communities even before they first won power in 2006, particularly in two areas that often decide the balance of power in Parliament: the suburbs of Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia. The Liberals and the New Democratic Party also seek support there, but the Conservatives often found that their more traditional approach to many social issues found an eager audience.\par \par \uc2 Canadian law makes it relatively easy to move from landed immigrant to citizen, and Mr. Griffith said that many newcomers became politically active once they could vote. Because Canada's immigration rules favor well-educated and affluent migrants, ethic communities are also an important source of donations to political parties, not least because the country's campaign finance laws ban contributions from corporations or unions and set a relatively low ceiling for individuals.\par \par \uc2 ''It's empowering in that there are groups that can no longer be ignored,'' said Arif Virani, 43, a newly elected Liberal lawmaker from Toronto who came to Canada with his parents as an Ismaili Muslim refugee from Uganda in 1972. He noted that in some constituencies, all three major parties ran minority candidates.\par \par \uc2 At times over the past decade, Jason Kenney, a Conservative cabinet minister, seemed to be appearing at just about every ethnic celebration in the country -- a butter-chicken circuit that appeared to take a toll on his waistline. But Mr. Kenney's courtship of ethnic minorities, Mr. Griffith said, was undone when the Conservative government decided to make it harder for recent immigrants to bring in relatives, when it was slow to accept Syrian refugees and when it tried to ban the niqab, or face covering, during citizenship ceremonies. Mr. Harper's use of the phrase ''old-stock Canadians'' on the campaign trail made matters worse.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Griffith reckons that there are 33 electoral districts where a majority of voters belong to what are known in Canada as visible minority groups -- people who are not of white European extraction. All 33 districts are in the suburbs of Toronto or Vancouver, and many were held by Conservatives until last month, when Liberals won in all but three of them.\par \par \uc2 Canada first introduced a policy of official multiculturalism, recognizing the differences in Canadians' heritage, in 1971 under Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a Liberal prime minister and the father of Justin Trudeau. Initially, the policy provided funds for programs like language classes, but it has since evolved into a broad legal protection of religious and ethnic differences.\par \par \uc2 Though it was contentious at first, the policy is now frequently cited by Canadians as a defining characteristic of their country -- though both Mr. Griffith and Mr. Virani say it has limits.\par \par \uc2 Canadians tend to think that, where the United States assimilates immigrants' cultures in a melting pot, Canada allows all cultures to flourish. But Mr. Virani said that the contrast was ''a little bit more gray than that.''\par \par \uc2 Voters appeared to reject Mr. Harper's plan to ban face coverings during citizenship ceremonies, but Mr. Griffith said there was still widespread unease about the practice of wearing them, which many Canadians believe limits the participation of Muslim women in society.\par \par \uc2 Still, despite the tenor of the Conservatives' last campaign, all the major Canadian political parties favor encouraging immigration. New arrivals account for two-thirds of Canada's population growth, an important factor in a country where there are now more citizens over 65 than under 15. Geography helps form that pro-immigration consensus by making it difficult to slip into the country as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or a refugee.\par \par \uc2 ''You can't walk to Canada, apart from the U.S., so we don't have a neighbor that generates a lot of refugees or immigrants coming across,'' Mr. Griffith said. ''That helps the discussion.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hussen and Mr. Virani have built impressive r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9s since coming to Canada. Mr. Hussen, who once lived in a public-housing project in downtown Toronto, earned part of his college tuition pumping gas for minimum wage at a service station a half-hour's walk beyond the last public transit stop. He did volunteer work as a community organizer and led an organization for Somali Canadians. As the first Somali-born person elected to Canada's Parliament, he said, he received congratulations from Somalian expatriates around the world.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Virani, who was an undergraduate at \uc2 McGill University in Montreal\uc2  at the same time as the younger Mr. Trudeau, also became a lawyer, arguing constitutional law cases, often involving human rights issues, for the province of Ontario before he sought office.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Harper's rhetoric rose over the niqab issue, Mr. Virani said, he found a corresponding rise in the number of voters he met who raised anti-Muslim sentiments.\par \par \uc2 The Harper government was ''just so far removed from the humanitarian and compassionate responses we've had over the past number of decades, under a number of governments of various political stripes,'' he said. ''It really gave me pause to wonder what kind of life I would have had, or what kind of future I would have had, had that government been in power in 1972.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''It's fundamental to Canadians' identity that they want to be seen as, and to be, a welcoming and accommodating nation.''\par \par \uc2 Above, a Muslim woman on her way to vote on Oct. 19.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES -- Federal immigration officials, who had been banished from Los Angeles County jails earlier this year at a time when many cities here were working to protect immigrants from deportation, will be invited back in -- with some limits -- under a new a policy that will allow them to interview and identify some inmates for deportation.\par \par \uc2 The change may reflect a broader shift in California, which has been at the forefront of efforts to protect immigrants -- even those convicted of minor crimes -- from deportation. A 2013 state law called the Trust Act prohibits local governments from turning immigrants who have committed petty crimes over to federal immigration officials, a policy that was seen as a rebuke to the Obama administration's deportation efforts. Major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco have largely stopped cooperating with federal immigration officials in jails, and opposition in the state to the Secure Communities program -- an Obama administration initiative that relied on local law enforcement to help with deportment efforts -- contributed to that program's end last year.\par \par \uc2 But sentiments have been shifting toward stricter enforcement, after two high-profile murders in the state this year for which illegal immigrants with criminal records face charges. One was the gunshot death of Kathryn Steinle at a tourist pier in San Francisco, said to have been committed by an undocumented immigrant who was released from county jail days earlier. The other was the rape and murder of Marilyn Pharis during a housebreak in Santa Maria, a city on the central California coast, for which two men are charged, one of them an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with an arrest record in this country but no felony convictions.\par \par \uc2 As recently as four months ago, the Los Angeles County government voted to end a plan that offered immigration officials a permanent place in its jails. But that will not end their presence in the jail system: Under the new policy, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will be permitted to interview inmates who have committed serious crimes, as well as all inmates who are being processed for release. In addition, the sheriff's department will give immigration officials a seven-day notice before some inmates are released.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors outlining the program, Jim McDonnell, the county sheriff, noted the need to balance public safety with maintaining the trust of one of the most ''immigrant-rich communities in the world.''\par \par \uc2 The letter said, ''Serving the community, reducing crime, and promoting public safety is immeasurably harder if law enforcement fails to maintain relationships with -- and the trust of -- our community.''\par \par \uc2 Still, immigrant rights advocates responded in anger Wednesday at what they considered a reversal of course.\par \par \uc2 ''In order for there to be trust, there has to be a firewall between the federal immigration agents and the sheriff's department,'' said \uc2 Angelica Salas\uc2 , the executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. ''Does the sheriff run the jails or does I.C.E.? He's saying they both do. He's giving them full access to the jails.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Salas said that in some cases, Sheriff McDonnell has constructed a policy that is even more generous than what Immigration and Customs Enforcement requested. For instance, instead of 48-hour notifications before certain inmates are released from custody, the sheriff's department will give immigration officials a week's notice.\par \par \uc2 But the sheriff's department will also advise inmates who are flagged for the federal agency of their right to legal counsel, something advocacy groups had requested. And federal agents will be able to use the county's databases.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Salas and other immigrant rights advocates accused the sheriff of bowing to political pressure from Donald J. Trump and others, who have put a spotlight on immigration this summer. But the murders of Ms. Steinle and Ms. Pharis have helped raise new voices in California -- including prominent Democrats like Senator \uc2 Dianne Feinstein\uc2  and law enforcement officials like the Santa Maria police chief -- in favor of more cooperation with immigration officials to help keep dangerous criminals off the streets.\par \par \uc2 Los Angeles County supervisors offered mixed responses to the sheriff's policy. Michael Antonovich, one of the board's most conservative members, expressed support, while Hilda Solis, who voted in May to remove the federal agency's office from the jails, said that the plan was cause for concern.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020150924eb9o0005x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The newest generations of immigrants are assimilating into American society as fast and broadly as the previous ones, with their integration increasing over time ''across all measurable outcomes,'' according to a report published on Monday by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants' education levels, the diversity of their jobs, their wages and their mastery of English improved as they lived for more time in the United States, and the gains were even greater for their American-born children, the report concluded.\par \par \uc2 ''The force of integration is strong,'' said Mary C. Waters, a sociologist at \uc2 Harvard\uc2  who led the panel of 18 immigration scholars who wrote the more than 400-page report. ''However we do it, we are good at it,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 The report is an effort by scholars not engaged in politics to summon the latest research to address many contentious issues in the increasingly heated immigration debate. It is the first major report by the national academies on the integration of immigrants since a similarly sweeping overview in 1997. Its timing is linked to the 50th anniversary in October of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 1965 legislation that abolished restrictive national quotas and opened legal immigration to all countries.\par \par \uc2 The study was initiated at the request of \uc2 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2 , a federal agency, and the \uc2 National Science Foundation\uc2  as well as private foundations. The scholars drew on their own work and also conducted a wide-ranging review of recent research by others.\par \par \uc2 Professor Waters said the report should allay fears that recent immigrants committed crimes more frequently than Americans, that they were generally in poor health and burden public health care systems, or that they were failing to learn English.\par \par \uc2 ''The desire on the part of immigrants to learn English is very high,'' Professor Waters said the researchers found. Concerns that the latest generation of immigrants is seeking to impose its languages on American society ''is not something people should be worried about,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 The report looked at 41 million foreign-born people -- including about 11.3 million immigrants here illegally -- and their children born in the United States, about 37 million Americans. Taken together, the two generations include one in four people in this country. English language learning ''is happening as rapidly or faster now than it did for earlier waves of mainly European immigrants in the 20th century,'' the report found.\par \par \uc2 Many immigrants -- about 85 percent of the foreign-born -- speak a language other than English at home. For 62 percent of them, that language is Spanish. But many of those immigrants speak English proficiently outside the home. Many already knew English when they arrived, the report found; about 50 percent of the foreign-born say they speak English ''very well'' or ''well,'' while only 10 percent say they do not speak English at all.\par \par \uc2 By the third generation, most immigrant children speak only English, the report found.\par \par \uc2 In a finding the scholars called surprising, the report says foreign-born adults and children are healthier in general than Americans. They are less likely to die from cancer or heart disease, and have fewer chronic illnesses and lower rates of obesity.\par \par \uc2 On education, the researchers found ''strong intergenerational progress,'' with the second generation equaling their peers among native-born Americans.\par \par \uc2 But educational achievement varied widely among different national groups, because of a significant population of highly skilled and educated foreigners, mainly from Asia, who have come in recent years. Almost one-quarter of immigrants have college degrees.\par \par \uc2 Those from Mexico and Central America started with ''exceptionally low levels of education,'' the report said. While their children ''progress a great deal relative to their parents,'' they do not reach the levels of their American peers.\par \par \uc2 On crime, the report found that over all, immigrant men 18 to 39 were incarcerated at about one-fourth the rate of American men in that group. ''Cities and neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have much lower rates of crime and violence'' than similar places without immigrants, the report said.\par \par \uc2 Professor Waters said the alarm raised over immigrants and crime, after the recent murder of a tourist on a San Francisco pier by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , had been raised with every influx of immigrants. ''We've always been worried that immigrants increase crime, and it has never been true for the first generation,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 However, there is evidence the crime rate is increasing as immigrants become assimilated, rising to match the rates of native-born Americans. ''If this trend is confirmed, it may be an unwelcome aspect of integration,'' the researchers wrote.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020150922eb9m0005e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 McALLEN, Tex. -- At the Republican debate on Wednesday and throughout the campaign, candidates led by \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  have assailed illegal immigration, and some have questioned whether children who are born to immigrants in this country illegally should be considered American citizens.\par \par \uc2 But here on the Texas border some local officials are engaged in activities that go beyond talk, enforcing some of the toughest rules in the country limiting the types of ID parents can show to receive copies of birth certificates. The result has been a refusal to issue birth certificates to many of the Texas-born children of immigrants here illegally.\par \par \uc2 Texas has not directly challenged the citizenship of the children, which is granted by the 14th Amendment to anyone born in the United States. Many of them have birth certificates in the state's database. It is just a matter of adequate identification, the state says.\par \par \uc2 Organizations that work on behalf of immigrants suspect that nativist sentiments are being turned into nativist policies, with the goal of making it harder for people in the country illegally to live and raise families in Texas.\par \par \uc2 Without a birth certificate, illegal immigrants say they cannot have newborns baptized, have had difficulty enrolling their children in day care and school and have lost or fear losing Medicaid coverage and other government services and benefits for their families. They said officials required birth certificates for these programs, as proof of parenthood or the child's Texas birth.\par \par \uc2 Some have older children who have birth certificates but younger children who do not, because local registrars who used to accept certain types of identification issued abroad no longer do.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not right,'' said a 34-year-old woman who was denied birth certificates for two of her children in McAllen, and who asked that her name not be used because she feared reprisals from the authorities. ''Yes, I'm here illegally. But I'm the one who committed the crime, not them.''\par \par \uc2 In court papers, lawyers for Texas disputed some of the claims made by those denied birth certificates, arguing that not having a copy of a birth certificate does not prevent a child from attending school or qualifying for Medicaid. And they say state policies do not discriminate against immigrants but are meant to ensure that birth records do not fall into the wrong hands.\par \par \uc2 ''Vital records contain private information that is confidential by law,'' said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, which oversees the state's Vital Statistics Unit. ''State and local registrars have a duty to protect that information by ensuring they only release records to people who are qualified to obtain them.''\par \par \uc2 Most Texans pick up a birth certificate by showing a driver's license. But illegal immigrants lack many of the approved forms of identification, such as a license or foreign passport with a United States visa.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants and their lawyers said local Texas registrars used to accept an ID card with a photograph issued to an immigrant by a foreign consulate. The matr\u237\'00\'EDcula, as the Mexican version of the consular ID is known, has been used by illegal immigrants to open bank accounts in Texas and receive other services. Although official Texas policy prohibited the use of consular IDs to obtain birth certificates, the prohibition was not strictly enforced until about 2013, when state officials in Austin began pressing local records clerks to follow the protocols, immigration lawyers said.\par \par \uc2 ''People in Austin started tightening the screws,'' said Efr\u233\'00\'E9n C. Olivares, a lawyer with the South Texas Civil Rights Project who represents the parents in the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 The refusal to accept the consular IDs coincided with the tough-on-immigration stance of Texas Republican leaders, the influx of Central American immigrants at the border last summer and the state's opposition to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which would give temporary reprieves from deportation to as many as four million immigrants and also permit them to work.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants and their lawyers said Texas officials had been intentionally requiring IDs unavailable to them as part of their efforts to bolster border security. One couple who were denied a birth certificate for their 6-month-old daughter say in court documents that they were told by a McAllen official that the requirements became more strict to prevent illegal immigrants from obtaining legal status through their American-born children.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama's executive actions on immigration, announced in November, would offer three-year deportation deferrals and work permits to millions of unauthorized immigrants who have a child who is an American citizen or legal permanent resident, and who have been living in the United States for five years and have no serious criminal records.\par \par \uc2 Texas officials say that immigration status plays no role in determining who is supplied a birth certificate. They say that the consular ID cards are not secure because the consulate offices do not verify the documents presented to obtain them, and that immigrants can use other types of identification to receive copies of birth certificates. The list includes student IDs, Medicaid cards, Mexican voter registrations, utility bills and paycheck stubs.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Van Deusen of the state health services department said the agency had never accepted consular IDs, but he suggested that local registrars had allowed them in the past without the state's approval.\par \par \uc2 ''We can't speak to what the practices of each of the more than 450 local registrars have been over the years,'' he said in a statement. ''If we've encountered a local registrar that was accepting consular IDs, we've asked him or her to stop and explained why.''\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants in other states do not appear to have had similar problems with birth certificates. New Mexico accepts the consular ID cards that Texas prohibits. California officials said they did not have any policies on the use of consular IDs to obtain birth certificates. Although Arizona does not accept consular IDs, officials there said they work with those who lack valid ID, including allowing witnesses who know the parent and who have proper ID to take part in the application process. In Nevada, one of the accepted IDs is a hospital birth record, which many of the Texas families have but the state does not accept.\par \par \uc2 ''There's no other state that has locked people out the way Texas has,'' said Jennifer K. Harbury, a lawyer with Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid who is representing the children in the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Plaintiffs in the suit are about two dozen families from Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. The number has grown since the suit was first filed in May and now includes 28 adults and 32 children. The lawyers for the families said there were hundreds and possibly thousands of others who had been denied birth certificates.\par \par \uc2 ''We've had people who've come to us asking for help, but they didn't want to join the lawsuit because they're afraid,'' Mr. Olivares said. ''They don't want the potential repercussions of coming out publicly as undocumented.''\par \par \uc2 One 40-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was denied a birth certificate for her 9-month-old daughter said she could not work as a result: Day care centers want a birth certificate, so she remains unemployed because she has no one to watch the baby. She and other illegal immigrants said they now limit their travels because they lack a birth certificate. If they drive north, they have to pass inland Border Patrol checkpoints, and they fear being separated from their children because they lack proof they are the parents.\par \par \uc2 Mexico filed a brief in support of the parents suing Texas, with its lawyers calling the state's actions a violation of international law that introduces ''a troublesome and discordant element into binational or transnational relations.''\par \par \uc2 Gov. Greg Abbott expected to discuss the issue with Mexican officials this month during his visit to Mexico City, but the topic did not come up, a spokesman for the governor said.\par \par \uc2 ''One thing both sides understand is that the Texas-Mexico relationship is bigger than any one issue,'' said the spokesman, John Wittman.\par \par \uc2 An immigrant and her 2-year-old are plaintiffs in a suit over the ID required for birth documents. (A1); A 40-year-old woman with her daughter; both are plaintiffs in a lawsuit. Texas says its rules are an issue of providing proper ID.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES -- More than 240 immigrants with criminal records who are living in the United States illegally were taken into custody last week during a four-day sweep across Southern California, immigration authorities said Monday.\par \par \uc2 All 244 people taken into custody had been convicted of a crime and more than half of them had at least one felony conviction, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, who called it the most successful sweep of its kind in the region. The majority of those arrested had been convicted of violent felonies, weapons or sex abuse charges. The rest had been convicted of ''significant or multiple misdemeanors,'' immigration officials said.\par \par \uc2 Roughly two-thirds of the immigrants taken in the sweep were from Mexico, and the remainder came from 21 other countries, including France, Ghana and Thailand.\par \par \uc2 For years, immigration officials relied on local prisons to help them deport immigrants who had been convicted of crimes, asking them to hold the offenders beyond their sentences so federal agents could pick them up. But immigration advocates said those requests, known as detainers, created a dragnet that deported thousands of people unfairly. Last year, a federal judge in Oregon ruled the practice unconstitutional, and California enacted a law protecting all but the most serious criminals offenders.\par \par \uc2 ''By doing these operations periodically, we show everyone what we can do to make the community safer,'' said David Marin, the deputy field officer for the immigration agency's Enforcement and Removal Operations in Southern California. ''Because local law enforcement haven't been able to cooperate with us like they used to, they have been releasing criminal aliens into the community, and we have to spend a lot of resources to be able to find them.''\par \par \uc2 This summer, two cases in California renewed the debate over deportations of unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes. In July, a young woman was killed on a pier in San Francisco by a man who had been deported to Mexico multiple times. And in August, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in Santa Maria was charged with murder after he raped and beat a woman in her home.\par \par \uc2 Officials say they are increasingly relying on the National Fugitive Operations program, which was created to find immigrants who had failed to comply with a deportation order, to track down immigrants who have recently been let out of jail. Mr. Marin said that the previous policy, which had allowed officials to take people into custody directly from jails, was safer and less costly.\par \par \uc2 After the sweep, immigration officials hailed the arrests of three people who had been convicted of sexual abuse. The operation, they said, focused on convicted criminals, gang members and people convicted of multiple or serious misdemeanors, like drunken driving.\par \par \uc2 ''What we're doing is targeted enforcement -- these are all people who are not only here illegally, but are convicted criminals,'' Mr. Marin said. ''These are people who are preying on our communities. We're not just rounding up the lady selling tamales on the corner or the guy standing in front of a \uc2 Home Depot\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Those who were arrested in the sweep but have not been deported previously will face an administrative hearing with a judge.\par \par \uc2 The others are likely to be deported more quickly.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020150901eb910004w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Jessica Otero's request to the judge, made in neat handwriting, was simple: She wanted a second chance. Ten years after she was convicted of driving an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  across the border, her felony record meant she could not get work in the medical field. ''I have learned from my past mistakes and am headed down a positive path,'' Ms. Otero wrote.\par \par \uc2 Federal district courts review dozens of similar requests a month, detailing how old convictions are affecting defendants' lives. Most judges have a standard response: Courts can expunge convictions only in exceptional circumstances. While Ms. Otero's two-page letter described fairly common circumstances, the judge's response was unusual.\par \par \uc2 ''Her concern is justified,'' Larry Alan Burns, a Federal District Court judge in the Southern District of California, wrote in June. ''The court is inclined to grant the motion.''\par \par \uc2 Through everything from protest movements to bipartisan legislation addressing the high prison population, the nation is in the midst of a searching examination of the criminal justice system, taking up long-simmering criticisms about race, inequality and law enforcement. While much of the focus has been on the police and prosecutors' work, some judges are now taking a more active role, pushing for a reassessment of how defendants are punished.\par \par \uc2 ''The popular view in our country has changed -- we don't want to hold somebody down forever and ever,'' Judge Burns said in an interview. ''I think judges should be aware of those things.''\par \par \uc2 It is hardly a uniform shift in judges' attitudes, but across the country, some judges are refashioning sentences, asking prosecutors to drop cases that judges see as unfair, considering how to reduce the long-term impact of old convictions, and writing essays advocating change.\par \par \uc2 Among the moves: In June, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote five pages denouncing solitary confinement in a Supreme Court case where solitary confinement was not the issue. Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan has written essays recently attacking plea bargaining and mass incarceration. In a June law-review article, Alex Kozinski, a United States Court of Appeals judge for the Ninth Circuit, criticized a variety of criminal-justice issues, including fingerprint evidence, prosecutorial discretion and long sentences. These ''are some of the reasons to doubt that our criminal justice system is fundamentally just,'' he wrote. Other judges are putting out their point of view in decisions in individual cases.\par \par \uc2 ''A growing number of federal judges, usefully insulated by life tenure, are feeling a need to speak out,'' said Douglas A. Berman, a law professor at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law. ''Judges are moved by the broader public conversation about the need for reforms, and certain ones say, 'That broader conversation ought to be reflected in the work I do, not just in the work that the political branch does.' ''\par \par \uc2 In June, three judges for the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reviewed an Indiana case in which an Italian-born man who had never become a citizen said he did not realize that a guilty plea in his marijuana-growing case would result in deportation. He asked to withdraw the plea. A district court judge denied the motion, but the Court of Appeals reversed that decision.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors argued that the man, Renato DeBartolo, could face a much more severe sentence at trial; thus his push to withdraw the plea was irrational. Judge Richard A. Posner, writing the Seventh Circuit panel's unanimous opinion, disagreed, citing the changing public opinion on drugs.\par \par \uc2 ''In light of the growing movement to legalize the sale of marijuana,'' Judge Posner wrote, ''a jury might have thought his offense trivial and either acquitted him or convicted him of some lesser offense.''\par \par \uc2 The judge then asked the government to reconsider even pursuing the case: ''The government should consider whether having served the prison sentence the government originally recommended and having then languished in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service for a year or more and then deported to a country in which he has never really lived, DeBartolo has been punished sufficiently and should now be allowed to go home to his wife and children without facing a new trial.'' Legal proceedings in his case continue.\par \par \uc2 Mark W. Bennett, a Federal District Court judge in the Northern District of Iowa, also pushed prosecutors, writing in an opinion in which he described prosecutors' ''stunningly arbitrary'' decision-making over whether to file information about a drug defendant's prior convictions, which increases their sentences.\par \par \uc2 ''These decisions are shrouded in such complete secrecy that they make the proceedings of the former English Court of Star Chamber appear to be a model of criminal justice transparency,'' Judge Bennett wrote in 2013. ''We as judges can and should do more.''\par \par \uc2 This summer, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, long known for his criticism of harsh sentences for the viewing of child pornography and for some drug offenses, questioned whether prison itself was an unfair punishment.\par \par \uc2 A defendant had pleaded guilty to possessing and sending child pornography using his computer. The defendant, now in his mid-20s, had poor mental development as a child and appeared to have been exposed to drugs in the womb, Judge Weinstein wrote. Placed into the foster care system, he was repeatedly raped by a foster brother and two separate foster fathers. Convicted at age 20 for showing child pornography to a boy, he was raped in prison, both by an individual and by a group of men. When he was released, he learned he had borderline personality disorder, depression and agoraphobia.\par \par \uc2 The defendant was supposed to be sentenced in June, but he appeared ''deeply depressed,'' Judge Weinstein wrote. The judge stopped the hearing, and instead asked the lawyers to address ''whether sentencing this defendant -- who has been raped multiple times -- to the statutory minimum sentence of 15 years violates his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment,'' especially given the likelihood he would be placed in solitary confinement as a protection from rape.\par \par \uc2 Arguments in the case continue.\par \par \uc2 Also in Brooklyn, Judge John Gleeson, who has criticized prosecutors for using the threat of mandatory minimum sentences to force defendants into pleas, and pushed them to drop charges so that mandatory minimums would not stack up, turned his attention to the consequences of convictions.\par \par \uc2 In 1997, a home health aide was raising four children on $783 a month in Queens. She participated in a staged auto accident ''ubiquitous in this district at the time,'' Judge Gleeson wrote, where passengers faked injuries and went to complicit medical clinics, which billed insurance companies for procedures that were never performed. The passengers often filed civil lawsuits, as the woman did, receiving $2,500.\par \par \uc2 Since her conviction, she has often lost jobs or had offers withdrawn. ''People said I'm very sorry for you. I can't hired you because criminal background checked and fingerprint,'' she told the probation office in a handwritten note in 2005 (English is the woman's second language). A year later, she wrote, ''I don't like welfare, I like to work.''\par \par \uc2 Last year, she filed a formal motion asking the judge to expunge the conviction.\par \par \uc2 The prosecution opposed her request, arguing that expunging should be allowed only in extreme circumstances, and this woman's was not one of them.\par \par \uc2 Judge Gleeson disagreed. ''The public safety is better served when people with criminal convictions are able to participate as productive members of society by working and paying taxes,'' he wrote in granting the woman's request. ''Her case highlights the need to take a fresh look at policies that shut people out from the social, economic, and educational opportunities they desperately need in order to re-enter society successfully.''\par \par \uc2 In June, another defendant, a nurse, also asked Judge Gleeson to expunge her 12-year-old conviction in a similar insurance-fraud scheme. Her lawyer, Mitchell A. Golub, wrote that she had lost jobs ''a half dozen times in just the last two years'' because of it.\par \par \uc2 As the government prepared its response, Judge Gleeson came up with a new idea: a certificate of rehabilitation that would show the defendant was now in good standing. With little legal precedent for that, he asked the prosecution and a policy expert to weigh in on whether that was an appropriate solution.\par \par \uc2 ''As a society we really need to have a serious conversation on this subject of people with convictions' never being able to work again,'' Judge Gleeson wrote in an email. ''A strong argument can be made that the answer to this problem should be more systemic, through legislation, not on a case-by-case basis in individual judges' courtrooms.''\par \par \uc2 Jack B.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ricardo Aca knew he could be fired. But he wanted the camera to roll anyway.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Aca is shown holding his cellphone watching \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  call Mexicans who enter the United States rapists, criminals and drug dealers. Then, Mr. Aca calmly tells his story.\par \par \uc2 A slight 24-year-old Mexican immigrant who graduated from high school and community college in Queens, Mr. Aca works at the Koi SoHo restaurant, which leases space inside the Trump SoHo hotel. He made a short video with a filmmaker friend and posted it on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  on Monday, where it attracted more than 300,000 views in 24 hours.\par \par \uc2 ''I was offended because this is not who we are, this is not who I am, this is not anybody I know who is an immigrant,'' Mr. Aca said in an interview on Tuesday, wearing his Mexican national team soccer jersey.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Amid the uproar over immigration in the presidential race -- marked by Mr. Trump's inflammatory comments about Mexicans and his plan to build a wall along the border and deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country -- the video ignited another debate over what it means to be legal in the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''I know I could lose my job for just talking about Trump,'' Mr. Aca says in the video, ''but it doesn't make me proud every day to go to work under his name.''\par \par \uc2 He described himself as an undocumented immigrant who came here at age 14. But in the video he did not say that he has documents that enable him to remain in the country legally. He was part of a wave of immigrants who came to the United States as children who have been granted deportation deferrals and work permits under a 2012 program.\par \par \uc2 With this legal permit, Mr. Aca has worked as a busboy for two years for the restaurant, which is not owned or operated by the \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a brief interview in response to Mr. Aca's video, Mr. Trump, whose immigration stance has helped vault him to the lead among Republican candidates, said: ''He's got a legal work permit. I've heard he does a good job. We thought he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  at first.''\par \par \uc2 But while Mr. Trump was quick to point out that his companies employ only people with legal work papers, his immigration policy is far less flexible in its definition of legal status. In announcing his immigration plan in a blueprint and in various interviews, he said he opposed the plan that allowed Mr. Aca to stay in the country and work.\par \par \uc2 For now, Mr. Trump said he would not press Mr. Aca's employer to punish him, though he added, ''I want to check his file.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Aca came to New York from Puebla, Mexico, with his 12-year-old sister. His mother had sought legal avenues for the family to enter the United States, applying for visas, he said, but was unsuccessful. She wound up in New York, getting a job sewing in a factory, and in 2005 arranged for her children to cross the border in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 As a teenager in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Mr. Aca steadily learned English from listening to Britney Spears songs. He graduated from Grover Cleveland High School in Ridgewood, Queens, and received an associate's degree in photography at \uc2 LaGuardia Community College\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He works as an assistant in the photography lab there and splits his time working at a Williamsburg sushi restaurant, Cherry Izakaya, as a runner, and at Koi SoHo. In the video, he said he wanted his three jobs to dispel stereotypes that Mexicans are lazy.\par \par \uc2 Asked why he defined himself as undocumented in the video, Mr. Aca explained his legal uncertainty.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm in the deferred action program, which I have to renew every two years,'' he said. ''I consider myself an undocumented immigrant still because it could just be taken away from me at any time.''\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, the Koi restaurant group demanded that the filmmaker, Chase Whiteside, take down the video, claiming that Mr. Aca had made false and defamatory statements. The video, titled ''Meet Ricardo, an undocumented immigrant who works in a Trump Hotel,'' was misleading, said Suzanne Chou, a lawyer for Koi Group, because it implied Mr. Aca was working illegally -- for a Trump hotel. Koi SoHo, she said, is a ''third-party tenant'' in the hotel.\par \par \uc2 ''Our company follows the law, and if you are eligible to work at Koi, you can apply,'' Ms. Chou said.\par \par \uc2 But David W. Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, volunteered on Mr. Whiteside's behalf to write a letter to the restaurant group in response. He argued that while Mr. Aca was authorized to work, he was still undocumented. He cited information on the website of the \uc2 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2  stating that ''deferred action does not confer lawful status upon an individual.''\par \par \uc2 On Monday, shortly after the video was posted, the Koi payroll department called Mr. Aca to bring the renewal of his work permit that he said he had forgotten to submit in December. When he walked into the kitchen, he said that line cooks from Mexico and sushi chefs from Japan told him they were proud of him.\par \par \uc2 ''It's important to stand up for what I believe in and to be able to defend myself,'' Mr. Aca said. ''If I do work at Trump SoHo, I have the platform to send this message.''\par \par \uc2 Ricardo Aca said in his video that ''it doesn't make me proud every day to go to work'' under Donald J. Trump's name.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc59}{\*\bkmkend toc59}\b \uc2 Trump Paints G.O.P. in Corner on Immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By TRIP GABRIEL and JULIA PRESTON   \par \uc2 1,270 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 August 2015\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republicans thought they had learned a lesson after 2012: Turning off Latino voters ensures defeat in the general election.\par \par \uc2 But as the disruptive presidential candidacy of \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  continues to gain support, his hard line on immigration has driven rivals to match his biting anti-immigrant language and positions long considered extreme. It risks another general election cycle in which Hispanics view the party as unfriendly no matter who the nominee is, Republican strategists warned.\par \par \uc2 This week, several of Mr. Trump's Republican rivals, including Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, echoed his call to end automatic citizenship for the American-born children of undocumented immigrants, repealing a constitutional right dating from the Civil War era.\par \par \uc2 And Mr. Trump's plan for mass deportations -- ''They have to go,'' he said -- which is supported by a sizable minority of Republican voters nationwide, has encouraged rivals to similarly push the edges on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a bill last month named for a woman who was shot to death in San Francisco by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , a case first highlighted by Mr. Trump. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana went further, saying mayors of sanctuary cities -- where local law enforcement officials decline to cooperate in federal deportations -- should be arrested as accomplices when illegal immigrants commit felonies.\par \par \uc2 National Republican strategists warn that catering to the most hard-line voters on immigration in the nominating contest will hurt the party in the general election, as it did the 2012 nominee, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , who endorsed ''self-deportation'' for illegal immigrants and attracted historically low Latino support.\par \par \uc2 ''If Republicans want to be competitive in the general election, they have to distance themselves from Trump on both illegal and legal immigration,'' said Alfonso Aguilar, an official in George W. Bush's administration and the executive director of the American Principles Project's Latino Partnership, a conservative group. ''His proposal on birthright citizenship is very insulting to Latinos, and every day, this is the top story on Spanish language media. Right now, if the other candidates don't respond to Trump, Latinos will buy the argument that Republicans agree with him.''\par \par \uc2 Demographics suggest Republicans have an even bigger challenge with Latinos in 2016 than in previous elections. The number of Latino voters has been growing rapidly. The population of Latinos eligible to vote by 2016 is expected to increase by 18 percent over 2012 to about 28 million people, more than 11 percent of voters nationwide, according to projections by the \uc2 National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials\uc2 , a nonpartisan organization.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Walker, who led in Iowa polls for months before being eclipsed recently by Mr. Trump, took a harder anti-immigration position on Monday by seeming to support an end to birthright citizenship during a visit to the Iowa State Fair.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Mr. Trump's hard-line positions, including seizing remittances sent by undocumented workers to Mexico and severely restricting legal immigration, are allowing some rivals to define themselves more clearly in opposition to him.\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 Lindsey Graham\uc2  of South Carolina called Mr. Trump's plan ''gibberish'' at the Iowa fair on Monday, saying, ''You're not going to get 11 million people and drive them back out of this country,'' he said. ''That's just not practical. That's going to kill the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 For now, the major Republican candidates who are relative moderates on immigration -- Mr. Graham, Jeb Bush, Gov. \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio and Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida -- do not have the momentum or the news media attention enjoyed by Mr. Trump, who is not only denouncing illegal immigrants in nativist language but seeking severe limits on legal immigration. And his calls to deport illegal immigrants are resonating with many voters.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm O.K. with that,'' said Jessie McInville, a medical technologist from Urbandale, Iowa. ''We all have to abide by our laws.'' Her husband, Jason, who said he twice voted for Mr. Obama for president, agreed.\par \par \uc2 Bruce Anderson, a farmer and auctioneer from Orion, Ill., agreed with Mr. Trump's plans to restrict legal immigration on the ground it has taken jobs from citizens. ''All immigration should be shut down in America for a while,'' Mr. Anderson said.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most difficult issue for the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2  is Mr. Trump's call to deport not only all illegal immigrants, but also young people who came to this country as children and have received protections though executive actions by Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 ''We have to keep the families together, but they have to go,'' Mr. Trump said on ''Meet the Press'' in an interview, broadcast on Sunday, aboard his jet at the Des Moines airport.\par \par \uc2 It is an issue that other Republicans had tried to duck, focusing on securing the southern border. At the first Republican debate for the bottom seven candidates in the polls, former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas framed the issue typically, saying that only when the border is sealed tight will Washington be ''up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally.''\par \par \uc2 A sizable core of Republicans favors such mass deportations, including 43 percent in a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. But that position is out of step with three-fourths of Americans -- including 76 percent of independents -- who believe illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country if certain conditions are met, according to a \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  survey in June. And a narrow majority of Republicans favor giving undocumented immigrants a path to legal status or citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Representative Steve King of Iowa, one of Congress's most hawkish Republicans on immigration, discounted concerns that the issues raised by Mr. Trump would hurt the party's brand.\par \par \uc2 ''They often say anytime you don't pander to Hispanics, you cost Republican votes,'' he said. ''I think Trump gets stronger with this position that says enforce our immigration laws.''\par \par \uc2 No matter who emerges as the Republican nominee, experts in Hispanic voting say many will remember the harsh anti-immigrant tone of the primaries. That was a lesson top Republican strategists drew from 2012, writing in a self-critical ''autopsy'' that called on the party to enact comprehensive immigration reform in Congress -- or continue being swamped in general elections by the growing Latino vote.\par \par \uc2 Well before Mr. Trump came along, his current rivals were toughening their immigration stances. \uc2 Mike Huckabee\uc2 , who as governor of Arkansas supported a state Dream Act giving in-state college tuition for undocumented students, said in March in Iowa that he wanted to ''stem the tide'' of people from Mexico who have ''heard there's a bowl of food just across the border.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Walker, who in 2013 favored a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, reversed himself this year, telling Fox News, ''My view has changed; I'm flat-out saying it.''\par \par \uc2 Ryan Call, a former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party, noted that Republicans like Senator Cory Gardner won election in the state in 2014 by opening a ''meaningful dialogue'' with Hispanic voters.\par \par \uc2 ''Trump's plan and rhetoric takes us in exactly the opposite direction and will undermine much of the progress we have made in reaching out to the growing population of Hispanics and immigrants in Colorado and in other battleground states,'' Mr. Call said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020150819eb8j0004w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Slamming the Obama administration for failing to penalize cities that shield illegal immigrants, congressional Republicans on Tuesday started to pursue legislation that would withhold federal funds from these so-called sanctuary cities.\par \par \uc2 The House is expected to vote this week on a bill that would bar the Justice Department from giving grants to cities that refuse to comply with federal immigration enforcement officials, a measure that Republicans hope can bridge the reopened chasm within the party over immigration as they try to avoid alienating Hispanic voters.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Senate Judiciary Committee\uc2  on Tuesday seized on renewed attention to the issue: Its members rushed to introduce their own proposals to crack down on noncompliant jurisdictions and heard testimony from relatives of victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Among those testifying was the father of Kathryn Steinle, whose murder this month has been highlighted by \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2 , a Republican presidential candidate, intensifying the debate. The suspect in her killing is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with an extensive criminal record who was released by the authorities in San Francisco despite a deportation order pending against him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump, who began his presidential campaign last month with incendiary remarks about Mexican immigrants, has become a political hot potato for many Republicans, who have faced increasing pressure to respond to his comments as Democrats like Hillary Rodham Clinton have portrayed him as the face of the party. House Democratic leaders on Tuesday called the House bill ''the \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  Act.''\par \par \uc2 While many Republicans have distanced themselves from Mr. Trump, the enthusiasm to introduce legislation to crack down on sanctuary cities pointed out the dichotomy within the party. Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, Jeff Flake of Arizona and David Vitter of Louisiana released proposals on Tuesday afternoon that would withhold federal funding from those that did not comply.\par \par \uc2 ''The bottom line is there's no consequence now, there's no teeth now, nothing happens to these jurisdictions,'' Mr. Vitter said. Mr. Grassley's measure also raised the possibility of increasing the mandatory minimum prison sentence to five years from two years for an immigrant who re-enters the country after being deported.\par \par \uc2 But Senate leaders tempered expectations for swift passage of a bill to punish sanctuary jurisdictions, many of which have questioned the legality of federal immigration law and its effect on immigrants. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he was not sure when such a bill would get a vote, while Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said he expected there would be hearings and committee votes on the proposals before one was up for consideration by the full Senate ''in due course.''\par \par \uc2 The House is set to vote by the end of the week on a bill introduced by Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, that would withhold some law enforcement grants from jurisdictions that resist federal immigration law or interfere with enforcement efforts.\par \par \uc2 ''You saw what happened in California,'' Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader, told reporters, referring to Ms. Steinle's murder. ''We want to make sure that doesn't happen again.''\par \par \uc2 The decision on whether to allow amendments to the bill is likely to determine whether it can reach the 218 votes it needs to pass the House, balancing the priorities of those who want to strike a tougher stance on illegal immigration with more moderate perspectives. The House Judiciary Committee passed a measure in March that, in addition to withholding funds, would tighten other regulations, such as mandating detention for illegal immigrants convicted of driving under the influence.\par \par \uc2 ''It's my understanding the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2  is divided on this issue already,'' Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, told reporters. ''It's only been on the table for a short period of time.''\par \par \uc2 Above, Jim Steinle speaking at a Senate hearing Tuesday on immigration. The police say his daughter Kathryn, in a photo at the hearing, top, was killed by a man in the country illegally.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- Judge G. Murray Snow pressed Sheriff Joe Arpaio to answer a bit of an odd question: Was the sheriff investigating the judge and his wife?\par \par \uc2 Judge Snow had already ruled against Sheriff Arpaio in a civil rights case brought by Latinos who said they had been singled out because of their ethnicity, and the sheriff was back in Federal District Court here after admitting that he had violated an order barring his deputies from singling out Latinos they suspected of being in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 But the issue at hand in late April involved whether Sheriff Arpaio and the Maricopa County sheriff's office had hired a rogue informant in Seattle -- a compulsive gambler who federal officials came to believe had sold them bogus antiterrorist technology -- to investigate whether Judge Snow and the Department of Justice were working together to take the sheriff down.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Arpaio testified that, yes, he had hired the informant. And that was only the half of it: Sheriff Arpaio also said he had employed a private agent to investigate Judge Snow's wife after the sheriff received an email from someone claiming to have overheard her mention her husband's negative views of the sheriff.\par \par \uc2 Both investigations led nowhere. But now, after Judge Snow asked pointed questions about the dual inquiries -- describing them as an effort ''to construct some bogus explanation to subvert this court'' -- Sheriff Arpaio's lawyers are using the judge's line of questioning to try to get the case reassigned. Arguing in court documents that Judge Snow raised the specter of judicial bias and impropriety when he asked questions pertaining to personal matters in court, they are demanding someone new.\par \par \uc2 ''This is not about vitriolic accusations against the judge -- he's a decent guy, a good judge,'' A. Melvin McDonald, a criminal lawyer retained by Sheriff Arpaio, said in an interview. ''It's about the personal animus he has displayed to the claim.''\par \par \uc2 It is also a sign of how Sheriff Arpaio has operated through much of his 22 years as sheriff, using his office and power to sidestep pressure to change his approach to policing, an issue that is part of the Justice Department's lawsuit, filed in 2012. He had previously begun other investigations against critics and opponents, drumming up claims of corruption and other malfeasance against state judges, elected officials and the publishers of an alternative weekly, Phoenix New Times.\par \par \uc2 All of the cases eventually fell apart: Many of the accused successfully sued the sheriff's office, earning millions of dollars in damages, paid with taxpayers' money.\par \par \uc2 Judge Snow now has to decide whether to remain on Sheriff Arpaio's case or to let another federal judge take his place.\par \par \uc2 Regardless, Sheriff Arpaio has more legal troubles on the way: On Thursday, Judge Roslyn O. Silver, who is overseeing a civil rights lawsuit by the Justice Department against the sheriff and his office, ordered a bench trial to start Aug. 10.\par \par \uc2 An appointee of President George W. Bush, Judge Snow has played referee and arbiter in the seven-year-old civil rights case against Sheriff Arpaio since Judge Mary Murgu\u237\'00\'EDa recused herself in 2009. Judge Murgu\u237\'00\'EDa's recusal followed complaints from the sheriff about an appearance of conflict, given that her twin sister, Janet, was president and chief executive of the National Council of La Raza, one of the country's largest Latino advocacy groups.\par \par \uc2 Judge Snow ruled against Sheriff Arpaio in May 2013, delivering what appeared to be a decisive blow against the six-term sheriff, then 80, a defining symbol of Arizona's strict approach to immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 But 10 months later, Sheriff Arpaio was back before him, facing stern reproach for defying his order to stop singling out Latinos during patrols and traffic stops.\par \par \uc2 He told Sheriff Arpaio in April that he was looking for ''a pattern that reflects a hesitancy on the sheriff's office, on the sheriff's department and on your part, or even a desire to subvert the orders of this court.''\par \par \uc2 One of the issues involved the failure by Sheriff Arpaio and his chief deputy, Jerry Sheridan, to properly disseminate the judge's instructions to officers. Before the hearing, they admitted to this and other failings and pledged again to stick to the judge's corrective measures.\par \par \uc2 But the hearing went on as planned.\par \par \uc2 In court in April, Judge Snow said that the Maricopa County sheriff's office was only 29 percent in compliance with the changes he had ordered 18 months earlier, right around the time the informant, Dennis Montgomery, started his investigation.\par \par \uc2 Judge Snow said he was troubled -- by both the investigation and what it had produced.\par \par \uc2 ''The court wonders why, when the M.C.S.O. should have been spending their time, money and resources in implementing its order, they were funding a confidential informant as well as three M.C.S.O. deputies or posse members to be in Seattle, Wash., accruing overtime, travel and salary expenses, as well as significant technology costs, attempting to construct some bogus conspiracy theory to discredit this court,'' Judge Snow said in court, referring to the sheriff's office.\par \par \uc2 He took to referring to the investigation as the ''Seattle operation'' and sounded skeptical when describing the reasoning and results of Mr. Montgomery's work. He said Mr. Montgomery had ''allegedly'' used information ''harvested by the C.I.A. and confiscated by him'' when he was a government software contractor.\par \par \uc2 The materials, the judge said, included fragments of email messages between the Justice Department and a former clerk of Judge Snow's, as well as snippets of phone calls Mr. Montgomery claimed to have tracked between Judge Snow and the former attorney general, \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 ., as well as with other high-ranking Justice Department officials.\par \par \uc2 On the stand, Deputy Sheridan said Mr. Montgomery had ''pulled data from American citizens for the C.I.A.,'' an assertion that the agency has denied.\par \par \uc2 When Judge Snow suggested that the materials provided by Mr. Montgomery were ''junk,'' Deputy Sheridan and Sheriff Arpaio agreed.\par \par \uc2 But the tale of the conspiracy has nonetheless reverberated from the glass-and-steel Sandra Day O'Connor United States Courthouse here to the halls of the Justice Department and the Pentagon. Last month, Judge Snow asked Michele M. Iafrate, who is representing Sheriff Arpaio in the civil contempt case, to write to the C.I.A., informing it that her client may be in possession of some of its materials.\par \par \uc2 The cache is also said to include bank account numbers and balances for about 50,000 residents of Maricopa County, Deputy Sheridan told Judge Snow.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Montgomery, however, could just be bluffing: His reputation, easily uncovered with a cursory search, includes ample allegations of deception. Federal officials came to believe that he had sold antiterrorism technology that proved to be a hoax. He has denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 In 2007, he falsely accused the governor of Nevada at the time, Jim Gibbons, of having received kickbacks from Mr. Montgomery's former employer to help it secure secret federal defense contracts. Two years later, Mr. Montgomery was arrested on charges that he had written $1 million in bad checks at a Las Vegas casino. A court hearing is scheduled for Aug. 12. He filed for personal bankruptcy that year, over mounting gambling debts.\par \par \uc2 ''This guy hired a person previously found to be a con man,'' said \uc2 Dan Pochoda\uc2 , senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, which represents the plaintiffs in the case against Sheriff Arpaio.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's office certified Mr. Montgomery as a confidential informant. On the stand, Sheriff Arpaio said he did not recall how much money Mr. Montgomery had gotten for his work.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Lemons, the Phoenix New Times columnist who first reported the link between Mr. Montgomery and Sheriff Arpaio, said he had relied on information from ''longtime sources,'' including a former detective in the sheriff's Special Investigations Division, the unit that had been handling Mr. Montgomery.\par \par \uc2 On Jan. 21, Mr. Lemons wrote about the investigation into Judge Snow's wife. It started, the article said, after a sympathizer wrote a private \uc2 Facebook\uc2  message to Sheriff Arpaio, telling him that the judge's wife, an old acquaintance, had mentioned during a casual encounter at a Mexican restaurant that the judge was out to get him.\par \par \uc2 Larry Klayman, Mr. Montgomery's lawyer, a well-known defender of conservative causes, has mostly taken aim at Mr. Lemons, calling him a ''sleazy reporter'' working for a ''discredited, ultraleftist and pro-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' publication.\par \par \uc2 But when questioned by Judge Snow in court, Sheriff Arpaio and Deputy Sheridan confirmed what the judge had highlighted: The investigations described in Mr. Lemons's reporting were real.\par \par \uc2 Joe Arpaio in Phoenix last week, being recognized as the longest-serving sheriff in the history of Maricopa County, Ariz.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW DELHI -- Photographs and videos on social media of an enraged mob that seized a man accused of rape from a jail in the northeastern Indian state of Nagaland, dragged him through the streets and beat him to death helped lead to the arrests of 22 people over the weekend, the authorities said.\par \par \uc2 The police identified 200 to 300 people who had either been involved in the violence that erupted in the city of Dimapur on Thursday or helped incite it, according to Wabang Jamir, a police inspector general in Kohima, the capital of Nagaland. More arrests were likely in the coming days, Mr. Jamir said, adding that it was unclear whether some of those arrested belonged to organized groups.\par \par \uc2 Another senior police official, Akheto Sema, said the thousands of people who descended on the jail were ''a frenzied, leaderless, headless mob.''\par \par \uc2 The charges against those arrested included unlawful assembly, rioting and arson. Shops were burned during the protests that sprang up on Wednesday and Thursday, after it was learned that a man said to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Bangladesh had been arrested in the rape of a woman from a Naga tribe. As yet, none of those arrested have been charged in his death.\par \par \uc2 A curfew was imposed in Dimapur, and the authorities, saying that they wished to prevent the spread of ''rumors,'' blacked out mobile Internet and text services throughout Nagaland.\par \par \uc2 The Nagaland police said that the man accused of rape, whom Mr. Jamir identified as Syed Sarif Khan -- other reports rendered his name somewhat differently -- came from the neighboring Indian state of Assam.\par \par \uc2 A brother of Mr. Khan in Assam, speaking to the news channel NDTV, said that his brother was an Indian citizen and denied that the woman had been attacked. Mr. Jamir, however, said that a medical report indicated rape. He also said that the Assam police should help look into Mr. Khan's origins.\par \par \uc2 ''I hope they will because right now we have a law-and-order situation on our hands, so there are limits to the speed at which we can do the investigation,'' Mr. Jamir said.\par \par \uc2 The killing screamed from the front pages of newspapers and flashed across screens all over India, a gruesome example of the often fierce collective response to allegations of sexual assault.\par \par \uc2 It occurred days after the Indian government banned a BBC documentary about a 2012 gang rape and murder, yet the deadly outburst in Dimapur seemed to be conflated with tensions, growing over the past few years in the overwhelmingly tribal and Christian state of Nagaland, over the rising numbers of mostly Muslim migrants, and the suspicion that some of the outsiders were connected to crimes.\par \par \uc2 The seizure and beating of Mr. Khan, recorded by spectators on their smartphones, also demonstrated the ineffectual response of the police, who opened fire, killing a protester, only after Mr. Khan had been killed.\par \par \uc2 Police officials said that officers outside the jail did not fire on the crowd because there were many young students in its ranks. It remained unclear how the mob entered the jail and took Mr. Khan. Two police officials and a district administrative official in Dimapur were suspended on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Though there was no specific religious overtone to the killing, Ahidur Rahman, a leader of the Muslim Council of Dimapur, said that a ''few hundred'' Muslim families had fled Dimapur in its wake.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jamir, the police inspector general, denied that Muslims were departing in any significant numbers. But Mr. Rahman insisted that the railway station was full of people, bags packed and hoping to catch night trains, and that his group had deployed its youth wing to persuade them not to leave.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020150309eb390008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER -- For four years Arturo Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez Garc\u237\'00\'EDa, an immigrant from Mexico, tried every legal move to stop his deportation. As a last resort, he camped out in the basement of a church here, seeking sanctuary from federal agents trying to expel him.\par \par \uc2 Obama administration officials have long said they are not looking to deport undocumented immigrants like Mr. Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez Garc\u237\'00\'EDa -- a taxpaying business owner and parent of an American citizen. But after he was arrested over a workplace argument in 2010, the immigration authorities were alerted to his status by a federal monitoring program. They began deportation proceedings that have continued to this day, even though he has been cleared of the criminal charges.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez Garc\u237\'00\'EDa was ensnared by an enforcement program known as Secure Communities, which connected local and state police departments across the country with federal immigration enforcement. Now the program, which generated the majority of the 2.3 million deportations under the Obama administration, is at the center of the battle between the president and Republicans over his executive actions to transform the deportation system.\par \par \uc2 Along with the hotly contested initiatives he announced in November allowing millions of unauthorized immigrants to stay and work legally, President Obama also canceled Secure Communities, replacing it with a new program that will greatly reduce the threat of deportation for immigrants like Mr. Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez Garc\u237\'00\'EDa who have no record of serious crimes. Under new, sharply revised priorities in the overhaul package, immigration agents will focus almost exclusively on deporting terrorists, gang members and felons who pose security risks.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, who now control \uc2 Congress\uc2 , describe Mr. Obama's actions as an unconstitutional overreach and have vowed to reverse them. On Wednesday the House passed a Homeland Security funding bill that would cancel his programs protecting illegal immigrants. The measure would restore Secure Communities and increase its funding, while taking away the president's authority to set priorities for deportation. Mr. Obama said Monday that he would veto the measure, which now goes to \uc2 the Senate\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, called it ''a reasonable response to the extreme actions the president has taken to undermine and rewrite our immigration laws.'' Secure Communities, Mr. Smith said, helped federal agents ''successfully remove hundreds of thousands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals.''\par \par \uc2 But to administration officials, Secure Communities had become a liability, causing separations of long-settled immigrant families, fraying relations with police departments and generating damaging legal challenges. In a Nov. 20 memorandum canceling the program, Secretary \uc2 Jeh Johnson\uc2  of the Homeland Security Department said it had ''become a symbol for general hostility toward the enforcement of our immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez Garc\u237\'00\'EDa, Secure Communities was the start of a torturous deportation process that continued inexorably even as administration officials insisted that they were going only after dangerous convicts.\par \par \uc2 Coming as a tourist 15 years ago, Mr. Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez Garc\u237\'00\'EDa stayed and built a business laying floor tiles, now with six employees. At a construction site in 2010, he had an argument with a worker from another crew who had trod on a freshly laid floor. The man called the police and Mr. Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez Garc\u237\'00\'EDa was arrested on an assault charge. His fingerprint check drew the attention of immigration agents.\par \par \uc2 He insisted on a trial, and was acquitted after witnesses confirmed that there had been no attack. ''I've had all these problems because one person spoke falsely,'' Mr. Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez Garc\u237\'00\'EDa said.\par \par \uc2 He and his wife, Ana, 40, who is Mexican, applied years ago for green cards through her father, an American citizen. Their applications are buried in processing backlogs. They have a Mexican daughter they brought here as a baby; another daughter, 9, was born in the United States. But an immigration judge who heard his deportation case was not convinced that it would be a hardship for his family if Mr. Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez Garc\u237\'00\'EDa was deported.\par \par \uc2 He spent New Year's Eve in a chilly basement room at the First Unitarian Church with his family, singing karaoke to melancholy mariachi songs. The congregation has agreed to shelter him, since immigration agents generally refrain from entering churches to make arrests. This week, immigration prosecutors in Denver declined to cancel his deportation order, so he will present a new application to have it temporarily postponed.\par \par \uc2 ''I want the citizens of Denver to know,'' he said, ''that we are not criminals.'' Except for his deportation order, Mr. Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez Garc\u237\'00\'EDa has all the qualifications for a work permit under Mr. Obama's new program.\par \par \uc2 Started in 2008, Secure Communities rapidly expanded under Mr. Obama to cover the entire country. Under the program, fingerprints of anyone booked by local or state police officers were shared with immigration agents. The agents could then issue orders, known as detainers, to the police to hold people suspected of being in the country illegally for up to 48 hours after release from local custody, giving agents time to detain them for deportation.\par \par \uc2 Official statistics show that agents modified their operations over time to deport more convicted criminals. But the government continued to expel immigrants following traffic stops or misdemeanor arrests, or after charges that never resulted in convictions.\par \par \uc2 The aggressive use of the program led to widespread protests. Demonstrators from the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a tenacious adversary, chained themselves to detention center fences and lay down in roadways to block buses carrying deportees.\par \par \uc2 Some police departments also stopped participating in the program, saying it eroded trust with immigrant victims and witnesses. A 2014 law in California limited the police to honoring immigration holds only for serious offenders. Last week, the departing governor of Illinois, Pat Quinn, a Democrat, ordered the police to stop complying with any immigration detainers.\par \par \uc2 Several federal courts have found that the detainers violated constitutional rights against illegal seizure. By the end of last year, 270 jurisdictions were refusing to honor detainers, and during 2014 local police departments declined to respond to 10,182 of the orders, Homeland Security officials reported.\par \par \uc2 The replacement program devised by Mr. Johnson, called Priority Enforcement Program, will start in the coming weeks, and still relies on fingerprint checks at the time of bookings by the police. But instead of mandatory holds, immigration authorities will in most cases send only requests, asking for advance notice when the police plan to release immigrants after they have been convicted of crimes.\par \par \uc2 Agents will issue detainers only for immigrants who fit in the highest categories of the new priorities, which went into effect Jan. 5, and they will have to specify why they have probable cause to pursue deportation.\par \par \uc2 Juliet Stumpf, a professor at Lewis and Clark Law School in Portland, Ore., said the new plans were ''a sea change'' from the canceled program. ''Instead of a hammer,'' she said, ''the administration is giving agents a screwdriver and an instruction manual and requiring them to follow it.''\par \par \uc2 But in Denver, Hans Meyer, an immigration lawyer, is still battling many deportations of immigrants snagged by the old program. ''The administration has a big credibility hole to climb out of,'' Mr. Meyer said.\par \par \uc2 At a hearing last month, he pleaded with an immigration judge to allow Mauricio Rosales, 32, a Mexican, to stay. Mr. Rosales was leaving a Broncos football game in a borrowed pickup truck when a policeman stopped him because of a dangling taillight. The officer ordered a blood test, and the two beers Mr. Rosales drank during the game were enough for a low-level misdemeanor of ''driving while impaired.'' He was sentenced to 15 days of probation.\par \par \uc2 Immigration agents, alerted by Secure Communities, went to the probation office to arrest him.\par \par \uc2 His wife, Roxana Burciaga, 22, an American, sat in court in a daze, trying to imagine how she would cope if she was left alone to care for their 14-month-old daughter and her two children from another marriage, all Americans, and her elderly grandparents, who depend on her help.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm the only one who is working,'' Mr. Rosales said, citing steady jobs as a carpenter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rosales might qualify for a work permit under Mr. Obama's new program for undocumented parents of American citizens, and that could mean an end to the deportation case. Mr. Meyer won a few more months for Mr. Rosales to find out.\par \par \uc2 Arturo Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez Garc\u237\'00\'EDa, with daughter Andrea, has taken refuge in a Denver church. He is set to be deported even after being acquitted of assault.; Roxana Burciaga said that if her husband, Mauricio Rosales, was deported she would be left alone to care for  their 14-month-old daughter, her two children from another marriage and her elderly grandparents.

California Has Lived It\b0\par\par\uc2 By ADAM NAGOURNEY, IAN LOVETT and VINDU GOEL; Adam Nagourney reported from Los Angeles; Ian Lovett from Bakersfield, Calif.; and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDLOS ANGELES -- There may be no better place than California to measure the contradictions, crosswinds and confusion that come with trying to change immigration law.\par \par \uc2 For 30 years, California has been the epicenter of the churn of immigration -- legal and not -- in the nation. It was California where Pete Wilson, the Republican governor, championed in 1994 a voter initiative known as Proposition 187, which severely restricted services to immigrants here illegally. And it was California where just last year, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, held a celebratory, dignitary-filled signing of legislation permitting unauthorized workers to obtain driver's licenses.\par \par \uc2 One-third of the undocumented workers in the country live in California, which has a 125-mile border with Mexico, much of it guarded by long stretches of border fence. They work on farms in the Central Valley, in manufacturing jobs in Los Angeles, and as housekeepers and gardeners in Silicon Valley, alongside a steady stream of young legal immigrants who hold high-skilled jobs in Northern California's critical tech industry.\par \par \uc2 They come mostly from Mexico but also from Central America, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan. Commercial boulevards in the heart of Los Angeles are a riot of Korean-language signs, and in many neighborhoods in San Francisco the talk on the street is as likely to be in Spanish or Chinese as it is English.\par \par \uc2 And while many undocumented immigrants take pains not to draw attention to their status, California nonetheless offers the prospect of a more open existence than much of the country does, albeit in an ask-no-questions fashion. Given the way many of these immigrants are already treated by the state, be it with the issuing of driver's licenses or some health insurance, President Obama's executive action on immigration was almost anticlimactic to many people here.\par \par \uc2 ''We are the state that has the most settled immigrant population in terms of people who have been in the country for 10 years,'' said Manuel Pastor, a co-director of the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration at the \uc2 University of Southern California\uc2 . ''We went through our Prop. 187 moment. We are at the other end. People will be eager to make this happen, because they realize we are going to get comprehensive immigration reform at some point.''\par \par \uc2 Indeed, more than half the undocumented immigrants in California have lived here at least 10 years -- far more than anyplace else in the country -- and one-sixth of the children in California have at least one parent here illegally, according to Mr. Pastor's center. That was illuminated by Mr. Obama's expansion of the deportation protection program, since it was based largely on how long immigrants have resided here and whether they have American-born children.\par \par \uc2 ''My parents are going to be able to qualify under this program,'' said Paola Fernandez, 28, a representative of the \uc2 Service Employees International Union\uc2  who lives in Bakersfield. She was brought here as a child and got permission to stay under Mr. Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. She has two younger siblings who were born here, which bodes well for her parents.\par \par \uc2 ''We've been here close to 25 years,'' Ms. Fernandez said. ''On a very personal level, this is a very amazing moment.''\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the extent of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population here spotlighted limitations in what the president had to offer last week. Most notably, farmworkers in the Central Valley found themselves divided between those whose children were born in the United States or who are permanent legal residents -- and thus eligible for the blanket of Mr. Obama's action -- and those who had children in their home country or not at all.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm scared that my family will be torn apart,'' said Maria Ramos, 21, who moved here from Zacatecas, Mexico, in 1994 and was granted a deferral in 2012 while her parents remained here illegally. ''It's scary to think my mom could get deported. They're going to tear our family apart. I wouldn't want that for other people to experience.''\par \par \uc2 There are few states where immigrants are as integral to the economy, whether in farming, manufacturing or basic services. And many analysts suggested that those different forces were reflected in the White House's attempt to parse the differing demands of, in particular, Silicon Valley, with its thirst for high-end technology workers, and the Central Valley, with its overwhelming demand for inexpensive labor to work on the farms.\par \par \uc2 In Silicon Valley, Mr. Obama offered a limited promise to open the doors to high-skilled legal immigrants brought here by technology companies, while making it slightly easier for those already here and eager to switch jobs without putting their immigration status in jeopardy.\par \par \uc2 Sujoy Gupta, an Indian immigrant who came to the United States in 2003 to study and now works at a start-up called \uc2 AppDirect\uc2  in San Francisco, said the current visa rules made it difficult for him and his wife, Pooja Madaan, who works in marketing, to change employers, travel or buy a home.\par \par \uc2 ''So every time I change my job, I have to reapply for my visa,'' he said in an interview in his San Francisco home on Friday. That is likely to change now.\par \par \uc2 These changes were less than what Silicon Valley business leaders wanted but stood in contrast with agriculture, where the White House resisted requests to create a waiver for farmworkers. Half the agriculture workers in the Central Valley have immigrated here illegally.\par \par \uc2 ''A major part of the work force that harvests the crops is undocumented, and it's time we just recognized that,'' said \uc2 Greg Wegis\uc2 , the president of the Kern County Farm Bureau.\par \par \uc2 Esther Cervantes, 53, who came here illegally nearly 20 years ago and packs the grapes her husband picks, paid to have her children brought over in 2000; they all received deportation deferrals under Mr. Obama's earlier act and are thus assured a future here.\par \par \uc2 ''I was expecting this to help me,'' she said. ''But for me, there's nothing. I don't have children who are citizens or residents.''\par \par \uc2 There has been a thriving underground economy across the state involving undocumented immigrants: the child care workers for wealthy software developers in Silicon Valley, where 8 percent of the work force is unauthorized, or the gardeners for estates in Beverly Hills. Presumably, that will come more into the open and, with it, promises for more job stability, an increased ability to change jobs and less fear of harassment by employers taking advantage of their vulnerability, said Reshma Shamasunder, the executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center.\par \par \uc2 ''It's going to be an important contribution to the California economy both in terms of raising revenues, but also the security of the work force,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 While other states may resist Mr. Obama's initiative, California officials are already looking to expand existing programs to help immigrants here illegally. At La Raza Community Resource Center in San Francisco's Mission District, which instructs immigrants on what kinds of documents they may need to apply for legal status, officials are preparing to help people take advantage of the new policy.\par \par \uc2 ''Once people know more about it, there will be a lot of interest,'' said Carl Larsen Santos, the center's immigration program coordinator. ''The psychological impact of having a work permit and not living in fear will be a huge boon to the community.''\par \par \uc2 California has had some notable pockets of resistance to immigrants, most recently over the summer when protesters carrying signs and American flags met three buses of immigrant mothers and children in the city of Murrieta. But over all, this is a state that has embraced measures intended to make it easier for immigrants to live and work within its borders. A survey by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  last week found that of the 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States, 2.5 million live in California.\par \par \uc2 ''California is more politically and emotionally evolved on this topic than the rest of the country,'' said Bill Whalen, a fellow at the \uc2 Hoover Institution\uc2  at \uc2 Stanford University\uc2  and a former long-term aide to Mr. Wilson. ''We have been through this for 20 years now. It's the California existence: You are familiar with illegal immigration, you probably tapped into it in some way -- hiring someone illegally to look after your children or tend your lawn.''\par \par \uc2 Matt A. Barreto, a professor of political science at the \uc2 University of Washington\uc2  in Seattle, said that even before the president's action, California held itself forth as a model on immigration. ''Across a variety of issues and policies, California has been a laboratory for the nation, forecasting and foreshadowing what might happen nationally,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Correction: December 7, 2014, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Nov. 23 with the continuation of an article about California as the epicenter of immigration misspelled the given name of a Border Patrol agent on duty near San Diego. He is Jacopo Bruni, not Jacobo.\par \par \uc2 A farmworker picking strawberries in Oxnard, Calif.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBERTVILLE, Ala. -- Residents here have long grown accustomed to the bright flourish of Hispanic flavor that has come to define their otherwise traditional Southern downtown: The bustle of La Popular, the supermarket stocked with coconut and mango, across from the sober white steeple of the First Baptist Church. The restaurant called El Sol King Pollo, with its tripe tacos and menudo, across Main Street from the Paisley Patch Boutique, with its gingham backpacks and monogrammed gifts for children.\par \par \uc2 The wave of Latinos hit this small North Alabama town in the 1990s. Many were undocumented immigrants willing to kill and cut fowl on the lines of the region's plentiful chicken plants.\par \par \uc2 Eventually Albertville, a city of 21,000, settled into its new reality, whether people liked it or not. And many have not.\par \par \uc2 ''It's been contentious at times, because it's brought a lot of the unknown,'' said Elizabeth Summers, managing editor of The Sand Mountain Reporter, a local paper. ''And people don't deal well with the unknown.''\par \par \uc2 Like those in cities and towns across the country, people in Albertville Friday were trying to make sense of what will change and what will not after President Obama announced his executive action extending protections from deportation to millions of undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 For the group of early-bird regulars having breakfast at the local \uc2 McDonald's\uc2 , the news was expected and unwelcome.\par \par \uc2 Joey Hartline, a local contractor, called Mr. Obama's action an act of ''domestic terrorism.''\par \par \uc2 ''He needs to be arrested and tried for treason,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Others are already daring to hope. A few hours later at El Sol King Pollo -- just before a lunch rush that would see the restaurant fill to capacity with white customers -- Maria Garcia, a waitress, said that she hoped that Mr. Obama's action would change her neighbors' opinions about people like her.\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of people don't like us because we're illegal,'' said Ms. Garcia, 29. ''But now we can emerge from the shadows, we can go into the streets without fear.''\par \par \uc2 White people, she said, often say that people like her do not pay taxes. No more.\par \par \uc2 ''Now we will pay like any other person,'' she said, adding: ''It's going to change this place a lot.''\par \par \uc2 The most important element of Mr. Obama's action, announced Thursday night, will give temporary protection to immigrants like Ms. Garcia, who have lived in the country for five years, and whose children are United States citizens or lawful permanent residents (they must also prove that they have not committed serious crimes).\par \par \uc2 For the Latinos of Albertville, it marks a dramatic turnaround from 2011, when state legislators passed one of the nation's toughest laws targeting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The goal, a sponsor said at the time, was to ''make their lives difficult and they will deport themselves.'' In Albertville, many Latino families vanished.\par \par \uc2 But the federal courts eventually rolled back many aspects of the law, and soon the immigrants were back, it seemed, in full force.\par \par \uc2 Those unable to lay low enough found themselves paying steep fines for driving without a license. Or worse.\par \par \uc2 ''It has been the saddest thing for so many people who were here, and in every other way following the laws,'' said Alejandro Silvestre, 36, a Guatemalan-born father of three and an owner of a strip-mall cellphone shop. ''But they got grabbed and sent back to Guatemala or Mexico and their families stayed here. Sometimes their kids were raised by others. For me, thank God, that has never happened. But one is always thinking of that.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Silvestre is among those who are hoping their lives will be transformed by Mr. Obama's action. On Thursday evening, just before the president's speech, he imagined the places in the United States he may soon visit without fear of being deported. ''This is a great country,'' he said, ''but what does it matter if we are unable to travel and enjoy it?''\par \par \uc2 Other Hispanics were more skeptical. ''Pura mentira'' -- pure lies, said Jos\u233\'00\'E9 Perez, 37, a construction worker from Oaxaca, Mexico, on Thursday night. ''It's just going to be nice words. I doubt it's going to change anything.''\par \par \uc2 The next morning, Gabriela Watson, an immigration attorney in downtown Albertville, said her phone had been ringing off the hook with clients who wanted to know when and how to apply.\par \par \uc2 She was telling them to gather their tax records, their children's report cards, and other documents they could use to prove they had been here for five years.\par \par \uc2 ''This new thing gives them hope,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 But many whites said they felt stung by what they see as an audacious and unconstitutional move by a president that they never much cared for in the first place. Some worried that the action would trigger a new wave of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Terry Chandler, a retired insurance agent, was sitting in the \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  Friday morning with Mr. Hartline and a group of white and mostly older men.\par \par \uc2 A number of them said they were proud and respectful of the immigrants who elected to go through the legal and time-tested process of naturalization. But Mr. Obama's action, they said, felt like a cheat.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chandler said that the undocumented immigrants had been stressing the local health and school systems here without paying their way. It pained him that they were now being rewarded.\par \par \uc2 ''It's wrong,'' piped in Julian Campbell, 80. ''What about the people who come here and done it right?''\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, opposition to the order was more visceral.\par \par \uc2 ''Well, hell yeah, a big majority of them's dirty,'' said Kyle Davis, a former state trooper, perched on a folding chair in an auto supply shop. He was asked what effect the action might have on Albertville.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not going to get any better,'' he said. ''That's pretty simple.''\par \par \uc2 But others had a more complex view. ''I'm mixed about it,'' said \uc2 Jeff Richards\uc2 , 50, a project manager at Carmon Construction. Mr. Richards said that he had a good friend who was undocumented, and a hard worker. ''I'd probably have him in a supervisory role if he were legal, but I can't,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Richards did not know if his friend would be eligible to stay in the country under Mr. Obama's plan. But he said he wondered whether there were enough jobs to support all of the immigrants who will now enter the legitimate job market.\par \par \uc2 It was one reason to worry. But Alvaro Jaramillo on Friday only wanted to talk about the reasons to hope.\par \par \uc2 A 50-year-old waiter from nearby Guntersville, Ala., he figures he will be covered under the new amnesty. Once he knows he is shielded from deportation, he said, he plans to apply for a small-business loan and open his own restaurant.\par \par \uc2 ''People will see it will be good for the country,'' he said. ''This will allow us to enter normal life along with them. And the economy will grow.''\par \par \uc2 Clockwise from top: Albertville residents at a McDonald's discussed President Obama's immigration actions; Maria Garcia, 29, a self-described \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and a waitress at El Sol King Pollo; La Popular, the supermarket stocked with coconut and mango.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FORT COLLINS, Colo. -- The national debate over the use of the term ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ,'' which has become anathema to people who support relaxed immigration rules, has fixed on an unlikely lightning rod: the liberal-minded, pro-immigrant owner of a Mexican restaurant chain.\par \par \uc2 The proprietor, \uc2 Pete Turner\uc2 , 43, opened his first Illegal Pete's restaurant nearly 20 years ago, and says that the name was inspired by the name of a bar in a novel and by his late father, also named Pete, who had a rebellious streak. At the time, said Mr. Turner, the word ''illegal'' held little of the political charge it does today. ''I never intended it to be about undocumented immigrants,'' Mr. Turner said. ''Never. Not once.''\par \par \uc2 But in opening a new locale here -- the chain's seventh -- Mr. Turner seemed to have stumbled on a political tripwire he had not known existed, drawing ire from local and national immigrant rights groups that say his use of the word in connection with a person's name is derogatory and offensive. Furthermore, they said, they are alarmed that an additional Illegal Pete's is slated to open in Tucson in August.\par \par \uc2 ''The crux of it is that it's become a racial slur,'' said Cheryl Distaso, 54, one of a group of local residents who are calling on the owner to change the name. Ms. Distaso said she believed that Mr. Turner had not mean to offend anyone when he opened Illegal Pete's in 1995. ''But the impact of that word in this day and this town is different,'' she said, ''and ultimately it's the impact of our actions that we're responsible for.''\par \par \uc2 The protesters have the support of Race Forward, a national group that began a campaign in 2010 to eliminate the use of the word ''illegal'' as an adjective for people, particularly in the news media. Race Forward has argued that the term ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' is a tactical term promoted by anti-immigration groups starting in the mid-2000s. The epithet, the group said, is dehumanizing, but quickly moved into the mainstream.\par \par \uc2 Race Forward's campaign, ''drop the i-word,'' has had some success. In 2013, The Associated Press announced it would remove ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' from its stylebook. The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  revised its policy, encouraging the use of alternative terms but allowing the phrase to be used for ''someone who enters, lives in or works in the United States without proper legal authorization.''\par \par \uc2 Fort Collins, about 60 miles north of Denver, is a city of about 150,000 people, about 10 percent of whom are Hispanic. It is also home to Colorado State University, a large research institution with a sizable minority population. This fall, after residents who are sensitive to the word ''illegal'' heard about the opening of the new restaurant, they urged Mr. Turner to meet with them. Among them were professors, students, immigrants and Latinos whose families came here generations ago.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Turner agreed to the meeting, which was civil but emotional. About 45 people attended, with several saying why the word ''illegal'' was hurtful to them. At least one person cried.\par \par \uc2 Destiny Story, 21, who is of Mexican descent, recalled having the word hurled at her in a high school dispute. She was born in the United States -- as were her parents -- but said that her legitimacy in the country is constantly questioned. ''I know he isn't a racist individual,'' she said later of Mr. Turner. ''But I also think there is a time for change.''\par \par \uc2 Kimberly Baker Medina, 53, a local immigration lawyer, moderated the event. ''If you're a young middle-class white person, you probably don't think it's a big deal,'' she said later. ''But if you're a 60-year-old Chicano, and you, and your parents and grandparents have been victims of racial slurs, it's a big deal.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Turner said the uproar had caught him off guard. He is particularly troubled by the barrage of supportive emails he has received from people who said they were proudly anti-immigrant. Mr. Turner, on the other hand, supports President Obama's initiatives to change the status of immigrants who are in the country already. ''I believe in all these things that the left has been pushing for, that Obama has been pushing for,'' he said. ''It's made for some strange bedfellows.''\par \par \uc2 Among his most passionate supporters is Milton Guevara, 30, a Salvadoran immigrant who began working at Illegal Pete's in Boulder when he was 14. He has risen from dishwasher to general manager. Along the way, Mr. Turner helped him acquire a green card, Mr. Guevara said, and is now helping him apply for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't see why they think this is offensive,'' Mr. Guevara said, urging the opposition to take a closer look at the origins of the restaurant's name. ''I'm very proud to be working for this company.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Turner said he gave a name change real consideration. ''I had to check myself,'' he said, ''and to be honest, I did. I have integrity, and when I said I'd listen, I did.''\par \par \uc2 In early November, though, he announced in a lengthy letter on the restaurant's website that he had heard the concerns of the opponents, but that their interpretation of the name did not change his own view of it. ''The name to me was unique and countercultural,'' he wrote, ''which I appreciated as a younger man. Still do. It's typically the countercultural places in our society that are the most accepting of individuals from all different walks of life.''\par \par \uc2 And on Thursday, he opened Illegal Pete's in Fort Collins to a crush of enthusiastic patrons.\par \par \uc2 By 11:45 a.m., the airy, warehouse-style restaurant was packed, despite record-shattering low temperatures. Several women bellied up to the bar and ordered local brews. Employees working the burrito line operated sandwich irons that heated giant tortillas. The crowd tended to be young, white and tattooed, though there were also families and older couples.\par \par \uc2 ''There was no debate for us,'' said Brett Warr, 47, who works in information technology for the city, explaining that he did not understand the fuss. ''It's not called 'the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .' ''\par \par \uc2 Above, Milton Guevara, center left, and Gabe Smith behind the counter at the new Illegal Pete's in Fort Collins, Colo., on Thursday. Below, Luke Franklin, right, and Jack Walsh. The men said they were fans of Illegal Pete's and came from Denver and Boulder to try the new restaurant. Left, Pete Turner, the owner of the Mexican-style restaurant chain.

Elisa Cho contributed reporting from New York, and A. G. Block from Sacramento.   \par \uc2 1,326 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2014\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDLOS ANGELES -- It would seem to be a worst case that opponents of the Obama administration on immigration had long forecast: An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  -- one who had been deported twice, yet returned to the country each time -- is accused of killing two Northern California sheriff's officers in a six-hour shooting rampage Friday.\par \par \uc2 The suspect led the authorities on a manhunt through two counties. After he was booked into the Sacramento County jail, federal immigration authorities used his fingerprints to identify the man, who gave his name as Marcelo Marquez: They said he was Luis Enrique Monroy Bracamonte, a Mexican who lived without papers in this country for more than a decade after he was deported in 1997 and again in 2001 because of drug- and weapon-related arrests.\par \par \uc2 ''This case shows that our laws are not being enforced, and there are tragic consequences to not enforcing them,'' said \uc2 Ira Mehlman\uc2 , a spokesman for the \uc2 Federation for American Immigration Reform\uc2 , or FAIR, a group that advocates tougher immigration controls.\par \par \uc2 The case could create a new problem for the Obama administration, as officials weigh steps the president could take after the Nov. 4 elections to expand protections from deportation for immigrants here illegally.\par \par \uc2 Emerging details of the suspect's history -- he gave his second last name in court in Sacramento on Tuesday as Bracamontes, not Bracamonte -- show that he crossed the southwest border at least twice in a wave of illegal immigration more than a decade ago, then used several aliases and stayed out of trouble just enough to elude detection as the Obama administration ramped up deportations in recent years and expanded systems to identify foreigners who committed crimes.\par \par \uc2 Under the name Marcelo Marquez, Mr. Monroy Bracamontes was arraigned Tuesday on 14 felony counts, including the murders of the two sheriff's officers, theft of a sheriff's vehicle and a shotgun, four carjackings and the attempted murders of three deputies and a civilian. The 13-page complaint, which the Sacramento judge read in its entirety, also lists special circumstances in the case against him, including killing an officer engaged in his duties and killing the officers to avoid arrest, which could allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty.\par \par \uc2 His wife, Janelle Marquez Monroy, who was with him throughout the shooting rampage but was captured first, was charged with murder in the killing of one deputy, with prosecutors saying she was an accomplice, and she faces other charges. She is a United States citizen, immigration officials confirmed.\par \par \uc2 During a brief news conference after the arraignment, the Sacramento County district attorney, Jan Scully, said she would not discuss whether prosecutors intended to seek the death penalty. She said that investigators had not determined whether Mr. Monroy Bracamontes was affiliated with a gang or a drug cartel, but that they were holding him in maximum security as a precaution.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said Mr. Monroy Bracamontes was deported for the first time in 1997 after he was convicted in Arizona of narcotics dealing. He was arrested again in Arizona in May 2001 on drug and weapons charges, but those were dismissed, and that month he was deported for a second time.\par \par \uc2 He was hardly an isolated example of a foreigner coming back to the United State illegally after deportation. From 2003 to 2013, about one-third of all deportations, 1.1 million, were based on reinstatements of court orders from previous deportations of the same immigrants, according to \uc2 Marc R. Rosenblum\uc2 , a researcher at the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , a nonpartisan group in Washington.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, 60 percent of all removals carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement were of foreigners who had previously been deported, said \uc2 Jessica M. Vaughan\uc2 , director of policy studies at the \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2 , an organization that favors reduced immigration.\par \par \uc2 Sometime after his second deportation, Mr. Monroy Bracamontes returned to the United States and moved with his wife from Arizona to Utah, where officials said he lived at least until last year. To judge from Utah court records for Marcelo Marquez, he was an exceptionally bad driver, with 10 misdemeanor violations from 2003 to 2009.\par \par \uc2 But none of those violations were serious enough to create a fingerprint record in state databases. After May 2009, the traffic violations stopped. A federal program known as Secure Communities, which checks immigration records based on fingerprints of people booked into jails, started in Utah in March 2010.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Monroy Bracamontes did not make a secret of the fact that he was using several names. On \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , he created at least two pages under different aliases, and the two aliases were ''friends'' with each other.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a very muddy investigation with multiple identities,'' Sgt. Lisa Bowman, a spokeswoman for the Sacramento County sheriff, said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Two Sacramento County deputies approached Mr. Monroy Bracamontes and his wife on Friday as they sat in the car in front of a Motel 6 in a Sacramento neighborhood where business owners had complained about a series of thefts, drug dealing and other crimes, Sergeant Bowman said.\par \par \uc2 ''They were just sitting in the car -- not looking to go in or out anywhere -- and that obviously raised a red flag in this area,'' Sergeant Bowman said. ''The officers simply just tried to approach them, and they just didn't get that far. The shots came from within the car very quickly, and that's what started everything.''\par \par \uc2 After killing the Sacramento deputy, Daniel Oliver, with a handgun, Mr. Monroy Bracamontes shot a motorist, Anthony Holmes, while trying to take his car, Sergeant Bowman said. Mr. Holmes is recovering from multiple gunshot wounds.\par \par \uc2 The couple then fled to Placer County, northeast of Sacramento. There, Mr. Monroy Bracamontes shot and killed a sheriff's detective, \uc2 Michael Davis\uc2 , and wounded a third officer using an AR-15 assault rifle, according to the charges against him. The couple is also charged with attempting to murder two other Placer County deputies.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials said the rapid identification of the suspect showed that federal programs now in place were effective.\par \par \uc2 ''This is underscores why technology like Secure Communities is so important,'' said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ''It relies on fingerprints, and it gives us a virtual presence in jails and prisons across the country.''\par \par \uc2 Last fall, the California passed a law known as the Trust Act, which significantly limited the kinds of violations that would allow local police to detain immigrants for federal authorities. Traffic violations that do not result in an arrest would not cause someone to come under federal scrutiny, said \uc2 Kevin R. Johnson\uc2 , the dean of the law school at the \uc2 University of California\uc2 , Davis and an immigration expert.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a tragic case that is already being used by advocates to argue against any kind of changes,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''But everyone agrees that this is the sort of person we should be focused on not having here.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: November 14, 2014, Friday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Oct. 28 about renewed scrutiny of immigration laws after an undocumented worker was accused of killing two sheriff's officers in California referred imprecisely to the Trust Act, which California lawmakers passed to restrict the situations in which local police may detain immigrants for federal authorities. The law allows for some felony traffic convictions to result in an immigration hold. It does not specifically mention traffic violations that do not result in an arrest.\par \par \uc2 A SWAT team in Auburn, Calif., responding to a six-hour  shooting rampage that killed two sheriff's officers on Friday.

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 8 P.M. (13) THE ROOSEVELTS: AN INTIMATE\par \par \uc2 HISTORY Ken Burns traverses half a century in perhaps the most important political bloodline in American history, starting with the Spanish-American War and ending with the Kennedy presidency, in this seven-part documentary presented each night this week. Paul Giamatti lends his voice to Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919), above in an 1875 photo; Edward Herrmann is Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945); and Meryl Streep is Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962). The authors David McCullough, George Will and Doris Kearns Goodwin offer their perspectives. ''The techniques Mr. Burns uses -- the program is full of still photographs and is largely in black and white -- are so associated with his Civil War opus that the entire saga may seem like ancient history to viewers under a certain age,'' Neil Genzlinger wrote in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . ''But even younger viewers know who John F. Kennedy was and associate him with the start of 'modern' life, with its fast pace and rock 'n' roll and emphasis on youth. Well, there, late in Part 7, are images of Eleanor Roosevelt sitting down with John Kennedy after his election as president. It's not just one political dynasty handing off to another; it's history handing off to us.''\par \par \uc2 10 A.M. (\uc2 Fox\uc2 ) FOX NEWS SUNDAY Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff; Gen. Michael V. Hayden, a former director of Central Intelligence; and Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and \uc2 Jack Reed\uc2 , Democrat of Rhode Island, discuss the \uc2 Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 10:30 A.M. (\uc2 CBS\uc2 ) FACE THE NATION The guests include Secretary of State John Kerry; Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York; William C. Rhoden, a sports columnist for The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , and James Brown, host of ''The N.F.L. Today.''\par \par \uc2 7:30 P.M. (Sundance) THE THREE BURIALS OF MELQUIADES ESTRADA (2005) Tommy Lee Jones, left, is the director and star of this contemporary western, based on an actual incident, about a Texas ranch foreman in search of justice and a proper burial for his Mexican friend, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  carelessly killed by a rookie border patrolman (Barry Pepper). ''The vein of American pragmatism that runs through this journey is matched by a sense of the pastoral that finds beauty in every natural corner and a humanism that looks kindly on even the hardest face,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in \uc2 The Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 8 P.M. (\uc2 ABC\uc2 ) COUNTDOWN TO MISS AMERICA Amy Robach of ''\uc2 Good Morning America\uc2 '' hosts this special, which goes backstage for the first time in the competition's 60-year broadcast history, as 53 women compete at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City. Chris Harrison and Lara Spencer return as hosts of the 2015 Miss America Competition, at 9. Lee Meriweather, the first Miss America to be crowned on national television, in 1955, is a judge.\par \par \uc2 9 P.M. (HBO) BOARDWALK EMPIRE After returning from a dangerous liaison in Cuba, Nucky (Steve Buscemi) visits Johnny Torrio (Greg Antonacci), who agrees to arrange a meeting with Salvatore Maranzano (Giampiero Judica), the new ''boss of bosses.'' Meanwhile, in a flashback to 1884, a young Nucky (Nolan Lyons, above) copes with the death of his sister (Onata Aprile), while his father (Ian Hart) goes face to face with the Commodore (John Ellison Conlee).\par \par \uc2 10 P.M. (BBC America) HARRY AT 30 On Monday, Prince Henry of Wales -- or Harry, to most of us -- turns 30. This special looks at his life, including the loss of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales; growing up in the shadow of his brother, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge; and what he thinks about being Britain's most eligible bachelor.\par \par \uc2 What's Streaming Now\par \par \uc2 BEHIND THE FIX In a digital companion to ''Ray Donovan,'' at 9 on Showtime, this webisode goes behind the scenes as Lena (Katherine Moennig) and Avi (Steven Bauer) pull off fixes taken directly from the plot of the television episode, in which Mickey (Jon Voight) puts together the team to rob a marijuana dispensary.

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 ''Let's say \uc2 Ron Paul\uc2  is Nirvana,'' said Kennedy, the television personality and former \uc2 MTV\uc2  host, by way of explaining the sort of politician who excites libertarians like herself. ''Like, the coolest, most amazing thing to come along in years, and the songs are nebulous but somehow meaningful, and the lead singer kills himself to preserve the band's legacy.\par \par \uc2 ''Then \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  -- he's Pearl Jam. Comes from the same place, the songs are really catchy, can really pack the stadiums, though it's not quite Nirvana.\par \par \uc2 ''Ted Cruz? He's Stone Temple Pilots. Tries really hard to sound like Pearl Jam, never gonna sound like Nirvana. Really good voice, great staying power -- but the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts.''\par \par \uc2 I met Kennedy (a gabby 41-year-old whose actual name is Lisa Kennedy Montgomery) in Midtown Manhattan at Fox News headquarters, where she hosts a Fox Business Network program called ''The Independents.'' By cable TV standards, the show, which is shown four times a week, is jarringly nonpartisan, for the simple reason that she and her co-hosts -- the Reason magazine editor in chief \uc2 Matt Welch\uc2  and the entrepreneur Kmele Foster -- are openly contemptuous of both parties. Kennedy spent most of the \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  '90s as \uc2 MTV\uc2 's most vocal Republican, but then she soured on the G.O.P., a political shift that solidified during the spending and warring and moralizing excesses of the \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  years. Sometime after the elephant tattoo on her left hip ''got infected and started looking more like a pig,'' Kennedy began thinking of herself as a libertarian instead. She, Welch and Foster take turns on the show bashing not only ''Obamacare'' but also the N.S.A., neoconservatives and social scolds. It's not a hospitable forum for G.O.P. talking points. ''There are some libertarian-leaning Republicans who are afraid to be on our show,'' Kennedy told me. Libertarianism's Nirvana, a k a the former congressman and former presidential candidate \uc2 Ron Paul\uc2 , has been on ''The Independents'' more than once. But Pearl Jam -- a k a \uc2 Ron Paul\uc2 's son Rand, a one-term Republican senator who may well run for the presidency in 2016 -- has yet to appear.\par \par \uc2 A few weeks after our conversation, I saw Kennedy onstage in a hotel ballroom, wearing purple spandex, gyrating to the soundtrack of ''Flashdance'' and hollering into a microphone, ''Are you hungry for more liberty?'' She was the M.C. for the \uc2 Competitive Enterprise Institute\uc2 's annual dinner, which, as Welch put it to me, ''in the tallest-dwarf category is considered to be one of D.C.'s best annual galas.'' The C.E.I. is a 30-year-old organization that routinely sues federal agencies, often when new and onerous regulations are posted in the Federal Register. Tonight's banquet had advertised itself as having an '80s theme, and so several of the 800 attendees arrived dressed as pop icons of that decade. After being introduced by Kennedy, the institute's president, \uc2 Lawson Bader\uc2 , strode to the stage wearing the decidedly pre-1980s Scottish formal attire of black jacket and kilt. Announcing pending lawsuits against the Affordable Care Act and the N.S.A., Bader thundered, to righteous applause, ''C.E.I. will continue to push back!''\par \par \uc2 Between dinner courses, Kennedy informed the audience that there was to be a contest, with a prize awarded to the attendee who had recently flouted the most egregious law or regulation. My tablemates -- among them Welch; a longtime member of the libertarian \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2 ; a French academic; and a woman dressed as Cyndi Lauper -- each scribbled their infraction on a piece of paper. One had smoked a joint on the sidewalk with a stranger, while another had traveled to Cuba without authorization.\par \par \uc2 At the night's conclusion, Kennedy announced the winner. It was a woman who, despite her lack of veterinary certification, had illegally massaged a pug.\par \par \uc2 Libertarians, who long have relished their role as acerbic sideline critics of American political theater, now find themselves and their movement thrust into the middle of it. For decades their ideas have had serious backing financially (most prominently by the Koch brothers, one of whom, David H., ran as vice president on the 1980 \uc2 Libertarian Party\uc2  ticket), intellectually (by way of policy shops like the \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2  and C.E.I.) and in the media (through platforms like Reason and, as of last year, ''The Independents''). But today, for perhaps the first time, the libertarian movement appears to have genuine political momentum on its side. An estimated 54 percent of Americans now favor extending marriage rights to gay couples. Decriminalizing marijuana has become a mainstream position, while the drive to reduce sentences for minor drug offenders has led to the wondrous spectacle of Rick Perry -- the governor of Texas, where more inmates are executed than in any other state -- telling a Washington audience: ''You want to talk about real conservative governance? Shut prisons down. Save that money.'' The appetite for foreign intervention is at low ebb, with calls by Republicans to rein in federal profligacy now increasingly extending to the once-sacrosanct military budget. And deep concern over government surveillance looms as one of the few bipartisan sentiments in Washington, which is somewhat unanticipated given that the surveiller in chief, the former constitutional-law professor \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , had been described in a 2008 Times Op-Ed by the legal commentator Jeffrey Rosen as potentially ''our first president who is a civil libertarian.''\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the age group most responsible for delivering Obama his two terms may well become a political wild card over time, in large part because of its libertarian leanings. Raised on the ad hoc communalism of the Internet, disenchanted by the Iraq War, reflexively tolerant of other lifestyles, appalled by government intrusion into their private affairs and increasingly convinced that the Obama economy is rigged against them, the millennials can no longer be regarded as faithful Democrats -- and a recent poll confirmed that fully half of voters between ages 18 and 29 are unwedded to either party. Obama has profoundly disappointed many of these voters by shying away from marijuana decriminalization, by leading from behind on same-sex marriage, by trumping the Bush administration on \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  deportations and by expanding Bush's N.S.A. surveillance program. As one 30-year-old libertarian senior staff member on the Hill told me: ''I think we expected this sort of thing from Bush. But Obama seemed to be hip and in touch with my generation, and then he goes and reads our emails.''\par \par \uc2 Early polls show young voters favoring \uc2 Hillary Rodham Clinton\uc2  in 2016, but their support could erode as they refamiliarize themselves with her, just as it did in 2008. Clinton has been even slower than Obama to embrace progressive social causes, while in foreign policy, she associates herself more with her former \uc2 Senate\uc2  colleague \uc2 John McCain\uc2  than with noninterventionists. Nor is Clinton likely to quell millennial fears about government surveillance. Welch says: ''Hillary isn't going to be any good on these issues. She has an authoritarian mind-set and has no interest in Edward Snowden, who's a hero to a lot of these people.''\par \par \uc2 After eight years out of the White House, Republicans would seem well positioned to cast themselves as the fresh alternative, though perhaps only if the party first reappraises stances that young voters, in particular, regard as outdated. Emily Ekins, a pollster for \uc2 the Reason Foundation\uc2 , says: ''Unlike with previous generations, we're seeing a newer dimension emerge where they agree with Democrats on social issues, and on economic issues lean more to the right. It's possible that Democrats will have to shift to the right on economic issues. But the Republicans will definitely have to move to the left on social issues. They just don't have the numbers otherwise.'' A G.O.P. more flexible on social issues might also appeal to another traditionally Democratic group with a libertarian tilt: the high-tech communities in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, whose mounting disdain for taxes, regulations and unions has become increasingly dissonant with their voting habits.\par \par \uc2 Hence the excitement about \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2 . It's hardly surprising that Paul, in Ekins's recent survey of millennial voters, came out ahead of all other potential Republican presidential candidates; on issues including same-sex marriage, surveillance and military intervention, his positions more closely mirror those of young voters than those of the G.O.P. establishment. Paul's famous 13-hour filibuster last year, while ultimately failing to thwart the confirmation of the C.I.A. director John Brennan, lit afire the Twittersphere and compelled Republican leaders, who previously dismissed Paul as a fringe character, to add their own #StandWithRand endorsements. Paul has also gone to considerable lengths to court non-Republican audiences, like Berkeley students and the \uc2 National Urban League\uc2 . In a presidential field that could include Cruz, Jeb Bush, \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  and \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , Paul -- who has called himself ''libertarian-ish'' -- is by far the candidate most associated with the movement.\par \par \uc2 It's nonetheless with some awkwardness that libertarians consider their sudden assimilation into the mainstream. Partisan gunslingers like \uc2 Glenn Beck\uc2  have recently called themselves libertarians, to the great annoyance of others in the movement. When I asked Kennedy if some of these new libertarians were former ideologues now rebranding themselves so as to broaden their appeal, she replied crisply, ''Yes.'' But she added that ''the idea of having a really specific litmus test is ridiculous. It's just another form of groupthink.'' Still, even \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  prompts notable skepticism among the die-hards. ''When he talks about 'Let's stop nation-building and let's start building bridges in Detroit,' a lot of libertarians roll their eyes,'' Welch told me. ''But he's done more to advance and popularize libertarian ideas in Washington than anyone else. In terms of changing the national debate, I think Rand has gone farther than his father.''\par \par \uc2 During the father's two runs for president as a Republican, in 2008 and 2012, libertarian activists gave him momentum far beyond his popular appeal, packing caucus halls and organizing rallies. But it's an open question whether these same activists will get off the sidelines and support his son, whose libertarian bona fides are less sure but whose chance of victory is far greater. And if they do, it's unclear whether G.O.P. establishment figures can put aside their longtime distrust of libertarianism and welcome Paul's bid to expand the party's base. If this is indeed the libertarian moment, do either libertarians or Republicans intend to seize it?\par \par \uc2 On the afternoon that I showed up to chat with the longtime libertarian writer and editor Nick Gillespie at the posh Washington offices of Reason, just off Dupont Circle, a dozen or so staff members were hanging out in the kitchen, drinking Green Hat gin. (It is named in honor of George Cassiday, a bootlegger who was known as ''the man in the green hat'' and who provided liquor to congressmen during Prohibition, thus making it a quintessentially libertarian beverage.) Gillespie poured me a glass and led me to a sitting area beside his office, which is festooned with vintage rock posters. Nick Gillespie is to libertarianism what Lou Reed is to rock 'n' roll, the quintessence of its outlaw spirit. He is 50, a former writer for teen and heavy-metal magazines, habitually garbed in black from head to toe, wry and mournful in expression, a tormented romantic who quotes Jack Kerouac. For the past 20 years, Gillespie has been a writer, editor and intellectual godfather for Reason, the movement's leading journal since its founding in 1968 (and which today has a circulation of about 50,000, while its website receives 3.3 million visits a month). By the standards of libertarianism's radical fringe, Gillespie is fairly tame: He prefers \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  currency over Bitcoin, has no personal interest in owning a semiautomatic weapon and faithfully votes in presidential elections, albeit for the \uc2 Libertarian Party\uc2  candidate.\par \par \uc2 His embrace of libertarianism coincided with a rejection of party ideology and collectivist thinking. As a graduate student during the 1980s and early 1990s at Temple and the State University of New York at Buffalo, Gillespie encountered the politically correct tunnel vision of what he calls ''the professoriate,'' which turned him away from liberalism for good. At the same time, Gillespie was unimpressed by Ronald Reagan, who declared a new ''war on drugs,'' raised the national drinking age to 21, raised all sorts of taxes, preserved Social Security which Gillespie regards as federally mandated generational theft) and in general claimed to champion American individualism while squashing it every chance he got.\par \par \uc2 ''I was never conservative,'' he told me as we sipped our gin. ''Republicans always saw libertarians as nice to have around in case they wanted to score some weed, and we always knew where there was a party. And for a while it made sense to bunk up with them. But after a while, it would be like, 'So if we agree on limited government, how about opening the borders?' No, that's crazy. 'How about legalizing drugs? How about giving gays equal rights?' No, come on, be serious. And so I thought, There's nothing in this for me.''\par \par \uc2 Gillespie likes to point out that unlike the words ''Democrat'' and ''Republican,'' ''libertarian'' should be seen as a modifier rather than a noun -- an attitude, not a fixed object. A cynic might assert that this is exactly the kind of semantic cop-out that relegates Gillespie's too-cool-for-school sect to the margins. Not surprisingly, he begged to differ. ''It's wedded to an epistemological humility,'' he told me, ''that proceeds from the assumption that we don't know as much as we think we do, and so you have to be really cautious about policies that seek to completely reshape the world. It's better to run trials and experiments, as John Stuart Mill talked about. The whole point of America -- and this is an admixture of Saul Bellow and Heidegger and Jim Morrison lyrics -- is that it's in a constant state of becoming, constantly changing and mongrelizing. We're doing exactly what free minds and free markets allow you to do. Part of why I'm a libertarian is that if you restrict people less, interesting stuff happens.''\par \par \uc2 Continuing his riff with beatnik locomotion, he added: ''It's like what happens in garages. Rock bands form in garages. Computer companies. And O.K., occasionally serial murders. But as long as you're not just parking your car there, garages are always interesting.''\par \par \uc2 Gillespie, Kennedy and virtually every other libertarian leader I met told me that their philosophy was unique for its ''consistency.'' And yet determining what it consistently looks like in practice can be a frustrating exercise. Foreign policy is the easiest place to start. With rare exceptions, libertarian leaders have recently advocated staying out of Libya, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Nigeria. Informing their reluctance to intervene overseas is the recent experience of post-9/11 neoconservatism. Gillespie, smirking, told me: ''\uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2  doesn't deserve credit for anything, but she wasn't the only one who didn't understand what the Bush Doctrine meant. And Obama's been as bad as Bush, but with less of an excuse. We don't have to pretend anymore that radical Islam is an existential threat to the West. It's herpes, but it's not AIDS. It's a chronic condition, but it won't kill us. Just keep the attacks to a minimum.'' Gillespie and others maintain that theirs is a posture of restraint, not isolationism. But it's an impulse reminiscent of \uc2 Ron Paul\uc2 , who not only opposed both Iraq wars but has also stated that President Lincoln was imprudent in declaring war on the South. Ben Domenech, whose web magazine, The Federalist, frequently publishes commentators from the movement, said, ''Libertarians have not yet espoused a comprehensive view of the world that shares more in common with, say, \uc2 Bob Gates\uc2 's realism than it does with isolationism.''\par \par \uc2 Beyond avoiding adventurism overseas, defining the libertarian agenda gets even trickier. Virtually all libertarians enthusiastically favor marijuana legalization, but they become more subdued when the subject turns to cocaine and heroin. They are united against most benefit programs but divided on whether to champion the outright abolition of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. On immigration policy, the purist stance would call for completely open borders, which Gillespie and a few others in the movement advocate, though not quite literally, and so down the slippery slope the ideal skids, into a murky world of armed deportation agents and registration systems and random drug testing. (Libertarian-leaning elected officials often say that there can be no open borders as long as the welfare state exists for immigrants to drain. Gillespie is among those who consider this a dodge.)\par \par \uc2 The so-called cultural issues have traditionally been a safe haven of libertarian concurrence and, as well, a showcase for the movement to demonstrate how it would apply laissez-faire principles to personal freedoms. One of the more pugnacious advocates of this across-the-board approach is Cathy Reisenwitz, a 28-year-old Washington-based journalist who has a tattoo under her right biceps that reads, ''I Own Me.'' (''What does that mean, 'I own myself?' '' \uc2 David Frum\uc2 , a former speechwriter for \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  and Republican commentator, sputtered in exasperation when we spoke later. ''Can I sell myself? If I can't, I don't own myself.'') Reisenwitz, a former staff member at Reason, writes a blog called Sex and the State that, she told me, ''thoroughly disassociates culture wars from free markets -- I disavow them 100 percent.'' When I asked her where she stood on abortion, Reisenwitz replied, ''I do not support any legislative restrictions on health care.'' She also espoused purity on same-sex marriage, telling me, ''If you're going to say, 'Government should be out of marriage,' and you're creating petitions and submitting bills, awesome. But in the meantime, if government is going to be involved in marriage as an institution, it should be available for everyone.''\par \par \uc2 But libertarian consistency on even these social issues is in the eye of the beholder. In 1968 \uc2 Ayn Rand\uc2  flatly declared: ''An embryo has no rights. . . . Abortion is a moral right.'' Twenty years later, however, the \uc2 Libertarian Party\uc2  proffered as its presidential candidate \uc2 Ron Paul\uc2 , an OB-GYN who has argued that the movement's bedrock nonaggression principle should apply above all to the most defenseless, the unborn. Today one of the more fluent anti-abortion journalists is also a self-identified libertarian: Mollie Z. Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, differs significantly from Reisenwitz on the subject of marriage, on the basis of what Hemingway maintains are libertarian grounds.\par \par \uc2 Even acceptance of same-sex marriage, an ostensibly pro-freedom position that has become nearly nonnegotiable for younger voters, is a stance that some self-described libertarians will not sign onto. When I asked Hemingway what she thought of extending rights to gay couples, she replied carefully: ''Well, I have always thought that government should be so small that it doesn't have a role in giving benefits. It's interesting to me that libertarians see government redefining the institution as something that will maximize liberty. And I am very skeptical about that.'' She added that while ''people should be free to organize their own lifestyle,'' the state had a unique interest in protecting heterosexual marriage, because it was ''the relationship that's ordered to producing children.''\par \par \uc2 This was a familiar point -- but for social conservatives like \uc2 Rick Santorum\uc2 , not for libertarians. When I pressed her on it, Hemingway said: ''Do I think the state should change the definition of marriage to allow same-sex couples? I think people should be free to organize their own lives however they wish. I'm skeptical about the way we're accomplishing this. I don't know. I feel like I need to think about it more.''\par \par \uc2 This is not the first moment that libertarians have claimed as their own. In 1971, The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  published on its cover a 5,200-word article by two young authors (one of them was Louis Rossetto Jr., later a founding publisher of Wired) who pronounced libertarianism ''undoubtedly the fastest-growing movement in the country.'' That same year, the \uc2 Libertarian Party\uc2  was formed; a year later, its 1972 presidential ticket of the philosophy professor John Hospers and the TV talk-show host Tonie Nathan received one electoral vote. Forty years later, little had changed. The \uc2 Libertarian Party\uc2 's 2012 candidate, \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 , a former governor of New Mexico, spent a million dollars and received more than a million votes -- a better showing than any of his party's predecessors, but not good enough to even remotely sway either the presidential election or the terms of the national debate.\par \par \uc2 Why has the libertarian takeover not come to pass? With charming understatement, the authors of the 1971 magazine article pointed out a small complication to this otherwise-unstoppable tidal wave they predicted. ''At present,'' they wrote, ''the only areas of disagreement within the libertarian movement are whether the movement should strive for anarchy or for limited government, and whether it should work through revolution or within the system.'' That tension has not gone away. During my travels with libertarians, I met many who cheerfully identified themselves to me as ''anarcho-capitalists,'' and I sat in on one speech -- by Bill Buppert, a blogger and the author of a book called ''ZeroGov'' -- that featured applause lines like ''any tax rate above zero percent is immoral'' and ''there are no good cops out there.'' I also encountered Beltway libertarians who revolt at the ballot box, like \uc2 Gene Healy\uc2 , a \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2  vice president, who told me, ''Usually I just vote for whoever the \uc2 Libertarian Party\uc2  throws up, even if it's a guy living in his car.''\par \par \uc2 Even if libertarians willingly engage the political process, there's little to guarantee that the process will engage them back. Each party would be only too happy to receive the libertarian vote as long as it doesn't have to do much of anything to earn it. But not since the days of the Vietnam War and Nixon's imperial presidency have libertarians seen much profit in an alliance with the big-government Democrats. Instead, ever since a newly inaugurated President Reagan declared, ''Government is the problem,'' politically practical libertarians have been more apt to cast their lot with the G.O.P.\par \par \uc2 And yet, the relationship between the libertarian movement and the Republican Party is a fraught one, to say the least. The G.O.P.'s traditional ''three-legged stool'' is propped up by not only libertarian advocates of free markets but also by hawks, who believe in a well-financed and forward-leaning military, and by social conservatives, who believe that the government should play a role in preserving family values. Neither of the other legs feels supported by libertarians, and with cause. It's hard to know whether Republicans in one or both of these other camps can ever make peace with a movement that they have spent a generation deriding. In a 1997 Weekly Standard article titled ''The Libertarian Temptation,'' \uc2 David Frum\uc2  belittled its followers as feckless hedonists who ''claim that snorting cocaine is some sort of fundamental human right.'' When I recently asked Frum if his feelings toward libertarianism had mellowed, he assured me that they had not.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a completely closed and airless ideological system that doesn't respond well to reality,'' he said. ''Libertarians are like Marxists in that they have prophets like von Mises and Hayek, and they quote from their holy scripture, and they don't have to engage.''\par \par \uc2 In practice, whenever a Republican politician has behaved more like a libertarian than a party loyalist, the party has made him pay for it. Despite the fact that \uc2 Ron Paul\uc2  served nearly two decades in \uc2 the House\uc2  and established seniority on the Financial Services Committee, in late 2010 the incoming speaker, \uc2 John Boehner\uc2 , reportedly sought to deny Paul a subcommittee chairmanship (owing to Paul's views on monetary policy) before eventually buckling to the outcries of Paul supporters. On \uc2 the House\uc2  floor, Paul typically sat with a fellow outcast, the antiwar Republican Walter Jones. During the G.O.P. presidential primaries of 2008 and 2012, the other candidates treated him with amused derision.\par \par \uc2 Since Paul vacated \uc2 the Capitol\uc2 , the libertarian movement's latest Republican congressional hero has been Justin Amash, a 34-year-old Arab-American and two-term House member from Grand Rapids, Mich., whose office wall sports adjoining posters of \uc2 Ayn Rand\uc2  and Mickey Mouse. Amash is the founder of the House Liberty Caucus, consisting of about 30 libertarian-inclined Republicans (and occasional Democratic visitors like \uc2 Jared Polis\uc2 ). The caucus serves as a de facto competitor to \uc2 the House\uc2 's conservative think tank, the Republican Study Committee, which Amash considers suspect in part because of its support for big military budgets. Even by the standards of his 2010 Tea Party class, G.O.P. leaders have viewed Amash as the antithesis of a team player for voting against Republican budgets that in his view did not cut deeply enough and for siding with liberal Democrats to end the war in Afghanistan. Last year Amash horrified military hawks and the intelligence community by introducing an amendment to defund the N.S.A.'s domestic phone-surveillance program, which came within a dozen votes of passage. Having already stripped the video-game-obsessed congressman of his seat on the Budget Committee, senior Republicans have now invested heavily in Amash's primary opponent in hopes of vaporizing his presence in \uc2 Congress\uc2  altogether.\par \par \uc2 One afternoon in late May, I had lunch in Chinatown with Amash, just a couple of hours after House Republican leaders gutted another of his anti-N.S.A. bills. He nonetheless wore a defiant smile. The public was on his side, Amash said, and not just Republicans -- and for precisely this reason, he added, G.O.P. leaders ''view us as a threat to the established order.''\par \par \uc2 Still, the anti-abortion and border-security-advocating Amash is hardly a radical libertarian. For the most part, his views are inseparable from those of \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2 . And so I asked him, ''Given how leaders in your party have reacted to your legislative proposals, how do you think they're going to react if Paul runs for president?''\par \par \uc2 ''I believe very strongly that he could be the nominee,'' Amash said. ''He just needs to get his message out there and push back against the caricature that some of the political establishment will make of Senator Paul. They're doing it because they're afraid of him.''\par \par \uc2 ''Why?''\par \par \uc2 Because, Amash said, Paul shared his ability to appeal to all kinds of people, not just big donors and not just entrenched Republicans. ''He destroys their system,'' he said with a thin smile.\par \par \uc2 ''I think the war on drugs has had a disproportionate racial outcome,'' \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  said as he stood in his cowboy boots before a small gathering of \uc2 Rotary\uc2  Club members in Shelbyville, Ky. ''Three out of four people in prison are black or brown. White people do drugs too, but either they don't get caught or they have better attorneys or they don't live in poverty. It's an inadvertent outcome, and we ought to do something about it. As a Christian, I believe in redemption. I believe in a second chance. I think drugs are bad. I think even marijuana is deleterious. However, a 20-year-old kid who does make this mistake ought to get his right to vote back, ought not to be locked up in jail for 10 or 15 years.''\par \par \uc2 It was not the kind of message that a Republican presidential aspirant typically delivers to an all-white audience. But as he continued with his off-the-cuff remarks, I began to see what the Kentucky senator was up to. After observing, ''We're a pro-coal state, and I'm a pro-coal senator,'' Paul then told the attendees, ''but I'm not for no regulations on coal,'' even going so far as to suggest that today's environment was better than a century ago ''and some of that's through government regulation.'' He assured the audience that he was all for affordable health care, just not the Affordable Care Act -- ''it's really about freedom versus coercion.'' And as his bedrock economic principle, Paul said, ''We can grow as a country, but government needs to be minimized and the private market needs to be maximized.'' But he was careful to say, ''That doesn't mean no government.''\par \par \uc2 Despite Amash's claim that Paul ''destroys their system,'' nothing about his rhetoric sounded remotely worrisome to the Republican establishment. At the same time, the political artfulness of his oratory was hard to miss. \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  was road-testing a kinder, gentler libertarianism to a mass market -- in effect triangulating (to use the term associated with \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 , whose moral lapses Paul frequently cites) Republicans, Democrats and libertarians. It is a maneuver that, if successful, could amount to a considerable triumph for the movement. By calling for significantly reduced sentences for drug offenders, Paul has slyly redefined the terms of the marijuana debate with a libertarian tilt. Though a self-proclaimed ''traditionalist'' on marriage, his seeming contentment with judicial trends on the subject is far more in keeping with Democrats than with others in the G.O.P. presidential field. And if Paul's foreign-policy addresses have more in common with the realism espoused by \uc2 Robert Gates\uc2 , a former defense secretary, than with his father's laissez-faire approach to the outside world, his worldview nonetheless marks a clear break from the hawkishness that still predominates within the Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 The hawks have taken notice. Dick Cheney dusted off the word ''isolationism'' -- which, in foreign-policy-speak, is essentially a synonym for ''wild-eyed extremism'' -- in describing Paul's aversion to a renewed military presence in Iraq. Rick Perry made a similar charge in a \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  op-ed titled, ''Why \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  Is Wrong on Iraq.'' Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2  has been particularly caustic, saying that a \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  foreign policy would constitute a dangerous retreat into a ''fortress America'' and dismissing Paul's drone filibuster as a stunt intended to ''fire up impressionable libertarian kids in college dorms.'' Paul, in turn, has enthusiastically ripped into each denouncer.\par \par \uc2 ''I think that Senator Paul has been very clever in trying to couch his foreign policy in terms that would appeal to most Republicans,'' said the conservative writer \uc2 Ramesh Ponnuru\uc2 , who, like \uc2 David Frum\uc2 , has qualms about the libertarian movement. ''But at the end of the day, he's a hard-core anti-interventionist, and Republican voters aren't.'' Ponnuru's latter assertion will be tested in the 2016 primaries, which could include, in descending order of hawkishness, Rubio, Perry, Cruz and then Paul (with foreign-policy stances by Christie, Bush and others yet to be articulated).\par \par \uc2 Over the past year, Paul has drawn a great deal of attention as the only likely Republican presidential candidate to venture into the hostile territory of college campuses and Latino and African-American groups. (Following the \uc2 Rotary\uc2  Club talk in Shelbyville, I watched Paul dedicate a plaque to the memory of an African-American doctor and civil rights activist. An 89-year-old black woman named Frances Marshall looked on with pronounced skepticism, telling me, ''Actions speak louder than words.'')\par \par \uc2 Less noticed is how Paul has taken pains to mollify the Republican base. He reminds audiences like the one in Shelbyville that he is ''pro-life.'' His assaults on the Affordable Care Act are frequent. Faced with criticisms that he is anti-Israel, Paul three months ago introduced a bill he called the Stand With Israel Act, in which the Palestinian government would not receive any further foreign aid unless it recognized Israel as a state. (''It was complete pandering,'' the libertarian Hill staff member told me.) Still, the vitriol aimed at Paul by McCain, Cheney and others in his party defies Reagan's 11th Commandment -- ''Thou shalt not speak ill of thy fellow Republican'' -- and harks back to the enduring animus between hawks and libertarians.\par \par \uc2 I asked Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, what he made of this rift. ''I think most people share my view about Rand as being pure-hearted in his views and intentions,'' he replied diplomatically. ''I just think he has some different opinions that not everyone shares. There's going to be disagreements within our party. Look at how the Democrats are lambasting the president over his pathetic approach to the border. Look, if \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  was such an outsider, I wouldn't have him speaking at three of our national events. I see \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  as someone who will build a lot of bridges in our party. Last year, he and I did a listening session with libertarians in New Hampshire. Libertarianism is certainly growing in the country, and I think it's an opportunity for the Republican Party to grow as well. And I see our party as being very welcoming to the libertarian movement and to \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2 . That doesn't mean you won't have disputes.''\par \par \uc2 Last month I dropped by the Russell Senate Office Building to talk to Paul about his libertarian-Republican tightrope walk. Paul, 51 and a native Texan, possesses a supple mind and is a preternaturally confident speaker for someone who has held office for only four years. At the same time, Paul is not particularly enthusiastic about the glad-handing niceties that come with the job. ''Good to see you,'' he mumbled, then flopped down into a chair in his office's conference room and fixed me with an impatient stare. I got to the point. Were we living in a libertarian ''moment,'' or was that wishful thinking on the part of Nick Gillespie and others?\par \par \uc2 ''I think a plurality of Americans don't consider themselves to be either Republicans or Democrats,'' Paul said, citing young people and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs in particular. ''I also think there was a time, maybe 30 years ago, when 'libertarian' was a term that scared people. Now I think it seems more like a moderate point of view. So I think the term is something that is definitely attracting, not repelling people.''\par \par \uc2 Paul qualified that observation by noting that the word itself encompassed a spectrum of positions. ''What I try to point out when people say, 'Oh, you're an isolationist,' I say, 'No, there's two poles: One is that we're nowhere any of the time, the other is we're everywhere all the time.' Right now we're much closer to the latter extreme pole -- and that's also coming from my party, the neoconservatives. So, really, libertarianism might be more like foreign-policy realism. There may be some libertarians who say, 'By golly, we're not going anywhere unless they attack us.' I think I consider myself to be more moderate on the foreign-policy spectrum.''\par \par \uc2 ''Do you think some political forces in Washington, like big defense contractors, hear your views on the defense budget and regard you as an existential threat?'' I asked.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think you should ever make a decision on what weapons systems we use based on the bottom line of those who make the weapons systems,'' he said. ''That makes some people fearful.'' Grinning, he added, ''But it should make other people feel hopeful.''\par \par \uc2 During our conversation, Paul made a point of characterizing libertarianism as being ''moderate'' rather than liberal on social issues. Movement leaders would likely object, but Paul's preoccupation is with swaying the center-right.\par \par \uc2 ''The party can't become the opposite of what it is,'' he told me. ''If you tell people from Alabama, Mississippi or Georgia, 'You know what, guys, we've been wrong, and we're gonna be the pro-gay-marriage party,' they're either gonna stay home or -- I mean, many of these people joined the Republican Party because of these social issues. So I don't think we can completely flip. But can we become, to use the overused term, a bigger tent? I think we can and can agree to disagree on a lot of these issues. I think the party will evolve. It'll either continue to lose, or it'll become a bigger place where there's a mixture of opinions.''\par \par \uc2 In effect, Paul was saying that the way for Republicans to win was to become more libertarian -- though only up to a point. Purity was the movement's game, not his. Paul reminded me that he worked on his father's 1988 \uc2 Libertarian Party\uc2  presidential campaign and felt a great deal of sympathy for anyone trying to take on the major parties. ''I also gathered signatures to get him on the ballot,'' he said. ''I know what a thankless job that is. Anybody who stands in a parking lot is thought to be an extremist.''\par \par \uc2 But later, with an irritated edge to his voice, Paul added: ''Some people are purists, and I get grief all the time -- all these libertarian websites hating on me because I'm not as pure as my dad. And I'm putting restrictions on foreign aid instead of eliminating foreign aid altogether. And I'm like: 'Look, guys, I'm having trouble putting these restrictions on, much less eliminating them! So give me a break!' ''\par \par \uc2 This June I watched Nick Gillespie deliver the keynote address at PorcFest, the annual libertarian outdoor festival held in Lancaster, N.H., and named for the area's ubiquitous porcupine. About 500 campers sat attentively, while several others stood off to the side, Hula-Hooping as they listened. Arrayed before Gillespie were several boxes of exotically flavored Pop-Tarts that he had purchased at the Lancaster grocery store. He held them up as evidence that individualism was flourishing and choices were in abundance or, as he put it, ''The libertarian moment is now.'' Their moment had arrived, Gillespie said, ''because the main political drivers have destroyed their credibility. Only the dead think the G.O.P. is the party of small government.'' At the same time, he added, ''the Democrats had a clean shot to demonstrate that they'd protect our liberties, and they proved themselves to be utter frauds.''\par \par \uc2 With deadpan aplomb, Gillespie then said, ''If we can have 20 different types of Pop-Tarts, maybe we can have more than two types of political identification.''\par \par \uc2 After the speech was over and Gillespie gamely posed for a few pictures with admirers, I cornered him and asked him if he was suggesting that libertarians leave the G.O.P.-flavored Pop-Tarts on the shelf. Gillespie said it all depended on Republicans. ''This is the fundamental question for the Republican Party,'' he said. ''Are they going to embrace the libertarian elements of \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  and Justin Amash? Because that's their only way out. They're at 25 percent self-identification, and it's not going to climb back up if they keep re-electing the old horses. Libertarians don't need them. We're already alienated and out of the mainstream. We don't need the Republican Party in the way that they need the energy and the vision of libertarians.''\par \par \uc2 But, I wanted to know, would libertarians be willing to meet the G.O.P. somewhere in the middle? Among the 1,700 or so attendees, I had seen guns and Bitcoins and slogans like ''Liberty: Too Big to Fail'' and ''I Do Not Consent to Searches.'' What I had not seen or heard was any show of support for \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2 . The crowd here at PorcFest, many of them young, all of them passionate, represented just the sort of army that Paul would need in the early primary states and beyond -- the same sort of army, in fact, that powered his father's improbable showing in previous elections. But they still talked more about the father than the son.\par \par \uc2 Gillespie acknowledged that the answer remained unclear. ''I think that if a major-party candidate articulates 75 percent of the catechism,'' he said, ''both self-identified libertarians and people who don't realize they're libertarians would vote for him.'' But then again, he said, it might take ''a hundred years or something'' for his movement to find its true expression in a political party. ''We've gone from a movement that didn't exist, then we all believe in this roughly similar thing, then we have a dalliance with the G.O.P., then we realize, no, we're totally separate. And then we find out, no, we really need to activate politically in a conventional two-party system,'' he said, his tone betraying little concern for the pace of this process. ''And it may be we're still some years away from that. I don't know.''\par \par \uc2 Our libertarian moment, in other words, might very well pass unexploited. But it remained, for Gillespie and his fellow travelers, a moment to savor: Pop-Tarts washed down with Green Hat gin. Interesting stuff was happening in the garage called America, and you could try to change the system, or you could also elect to be boring. Either way, you were at perfect liberty.\par \par \uc2 Kennedy, a former MTV personality and now a libertarian activist, performs at the annual dinner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Shortly after \uc2 Jeh Johnson\uc2  was confirmed as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, he invited the flamboyant antiwar protesters from Code Pink to his new office to chat about national security and immigration.\par \par \uc2 A few months before, Code Pink demonstrators had projected a film about drone warfare onto the brick front of his stately Georgetown home, passing around popcorn and taunting Mr. Johnson, who had retreated to a neighbor's house but then wandered out to greet them. In his previous job as the \uc2 Pentagon\uc2 's general counsel, Mr. Johnson helped draft the legal justification for the military's use of armed drones.\par \par \uc2 ''We were surprised that he took the time to speak with us'' in his office, said Alli McCracken, the national coordinator of the group, whose members still strongly disagree with Mr. Johnson's policies. ''It was nice.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson's velvety style will be confronted with a far more difficult test as he faces off with \uc2 Congress\uc2 , governors, immigration advocates, businesses and other groups that are fighting over what to do about the record numbers of unaccompanied children from Central America slipping into the United States. As the cabinet member charged with securing the nation's borders, Mr. Johnson is mired in President Obama's efforts to send the Central American children back -- and in a parallel White House debate about whether to allow a large portion of the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States to stay.\par \par \uc2 He is working closely with Mr. Obama, who is moving ahead without \uc2 Congress\uc2  and is to announce by the end of the summer an executive order that could possibly allow millions to stay in the country. ''We're going to develop this together,'' Mr. Johnson said during an interview in his office at the Homeland Security headquarters in Northwest Washington. Will this make him the main absorber of the flames of debate? ''Unfortunately, yes.''\par \par \uc2 Immigration advocates are waiting to see what the administration does before deciding what to make of Mr. Johnson, who has been in office only eight months, but who went through the painstaking process, one dissenter at a time, of helping to make the legal case to repeal the military's discriminatory ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy against gay men and lesbians.\par \par \uc2 ''We will have a better sense of who this man is in a couple weeks,'' said Lorella Praeli, the director of advocacy for United We Dream, the largest national network of young immigrants.\par \par \uc2 For now, Mr. Johnson, 56, the fourth secretary of a $60 billion department that grew from the wreckage of the Sept. 11 attacks, is working all sides. He draws praise from Republican lawmakers over his support for changes to laws that would expedite deportations of the Central American children -- a position Mr. Obama has backed away from and one many congressional Democrats deplore. At a recent meeting on Capitol Hill, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, confronted Mr. Johnson about his view that the administration needed more flexibility to quickly send the children back.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson's view is shared by many Republicans. ''In my conversations with Secretary Johnson, he knows what needs to be done on the border,'' said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. ''It remains to be seen if the president will allow him to be successful.''\par \par \uc2 Yet Mr. Johnson also has the cautious support, so far, of many immigration advocates.\par \par \uc2 ''Johnson is a product of the civil rights movement,'' said \uc2 Frank Sharry\uc2 , the executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration group. ''He listens to everyone, from undocumented youth to hard-right anti-immigrants.''\par \par \uc2 Immigration advocates also credit Mr. Johnson with speaking up about a border crisis that both Democrats and Republicans say the White House was slow to notice, even as the number of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children surged in the last year.\par \par \uc2 ''I have worked on this topic since 2010,'' said Elizabeth Kennedy, an advocate and researcher who has studied the issue of illegal child immigrants and has struggled to get statistics from the Obama administration. ''This year they started actually promoting the numbers.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson said he ordered more resources to the Rio Grande area after he assumed office in late December, and made several visits to the border in the spring, often with lawmakers, to try to bring attention to the problem. He and his wife, Susan DiMarco, made an impromptu visit on Mother's Day to the McAllen, Tex., Border Patrol station, which was overflowing with Central American children.\par \par \uc2 They were confronted with table after table of children who had made dangerous trips across the border alone. One girl told Mr. Johnson that her mother was dead and that she was searching for her father. ''My translator started to cry,'' Mr. Johnson told an audience in Aspen, Colo., last month. ''I don't mind telling you I started to cry.'' The fate of the child, he said, ''is something I will wonder about all the rest of my life.''\par \par \uc2 At the \uc2 Pentagon\uc2 , Mr. Johnson at one point made extensive use of data to argue that the ''don't ask, don't tell'' rule should be repealed. He demonstrated that members of the Special Operations forces, the commandos who are the tip of the combat spear, were largely indifferent to the sexual orientation of fellow service members.\par \par \uc2 ''Jeh was not somebody who kind of confronted that on the basis of, 'You're going to do it or else,' '' said \uc2 Leon E. Panetta\uc2 , the former defense secretary. ''He really listened to the concerns and questions that were being raised and almost in every instance tried to respond to those concerns.'' He added, ''If it wasn't for him I don't think it would really have happened.''\par \par \uc2 Some facts about Mr. Johnson: His wife is a dentist, and he had to have several fillings and teeth whitenings before she would date him. His favorite restaurant is La Perla, an elaborate Italian place with friezes on Pennsylvania Avenue. When he writes speeches, he prefers to do so on a porch in Martha's Vineyard, with headphones blasting Sam Cooke or James Brown. He was the first black partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. When he was general counsel at the Defense Department, he watched videos of every single drone strike he approved, to understand their impact. When it came time for him to leave the \uc2 Pentagon\uc2 , he was so emotional that he had his son read his parting remarks.\par \par \uc2 And he likes to garden.\par \par \uc2 ''You see those white and red roses out there?'' Mr. Johnson asked, peering out his office window at a mostly grim view of brick, concrete and a patch of weed-infested grass. ''I planted those.'' He also planted 200 impatiens at 6 a.m. outside his house on the morning that a \uc2 Navy\uc2  SEAL team killed Osama bin Laden, to work out some nerves.\par \par \uc2 He owns a bright blue Mustang convertible. ''I saw this flashy car at the \uc2 Pentagon\uc2  and said, 'What the hell is that about?' '' Mr. Panetta recalled. ''He did enjoy driving that little baby and parking it in front of the \uc2 Pentagon\uc2 . He thought that made more of a statement than anything else.''\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Paul Weiss\uc2 , Mr. Johnson's former colleagues see his new role as a synthesis of his old jobs.\par \par \uc2 ''He is well suited for this terribly complicated immigration problem because he has perspective of a former federal prosecutor, so he understands the enforcement issues,'' said Theodore V. Wells Jr., a partner at the firm. ''And at the same time he is extraordinarily compassionate.''\par \par \uc2 He added: ''There are multiple camps, some of them dug in, on the immigration front. Jeh appreciates that if you come up with a solution that is not acceptable to the public or \uc2 Congress\uc2  it may in theory be the right solution. But it's not a solution you can sell.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson said he was acutely aware of the battles ahead. New policies, he said, need to ''cherish our diversity, cherish our immigrant history and have respect for the laws that reflect our values. I'm responsible for border security. Our borders are not open to illegal immigration.''\par \par \uc2 Secretary Jeh Johnson's efforts have won praise from Republicans and given him cautious support among immigration advocates.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc72}{\*\bkmkend toc72}\b \uc2 On Immigration, the Hard Lines Start to Blur\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAMIEN CAVE   \par \uc2 2,114 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 June 2014\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FARMERS BRANCH, Tex. -- Halfway through an evening of campaigning for mayor of this Dallas suburb, David Koch met a Colombian immigrant who had just moved in. ''Well, welcome to the town,'' he said, adding after friendly chatter: ''Why did you pick Farmers Branch?''\par \par \uc2 ''Safety,'' the woman said, noting with relief that a local law viewed as anti-immigrant by Latinos had been struck down. Mr. Koch simply nodded.\par \par \uc2 He never mentioned his support for the 2007 measure requiring renters to prove legal status, one in a series of laws that made Farmers Branch famous and infamous in immigration circles nationwide. In fact, at every house he visited, he avoided bringing up the law or even illegal immigration, which he had once loudly denounced.\par \par \uc2 ''We're done,'' Mr. Koch, a trial lawyer, said, noting that the city's final appeal to keep the laws in force was denied in March. ''This anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  stuff is behind us. My sole goal is going to be to focus on revitalization and public safety.''\par \par \uc2 Immigration continues to be a subject of intense political debate and a source of simmering anger among people concerned about Central American families showing up at the border -- and about the risk of even more traffic if citizenship is granted to people who came illegally.\par \par \uc2 But in many communities along Interstate 35, the highway that has carried millions of Hispanic immigrants into towns and cities clear to the Canadian border, fatigue with the issue and years of interaction with immigrants seems to be softening the once-hardened opposition and outrage about immigration's impact.\par \par \uc2 For many Americans, attitudes about the immigrants themselves, including those in the country illegally, have essentially shifted toward a begrudging pragmatism summed up with an often-heard phrase: ''They're here, we have to deal with it.''\par \par \uc2 ''It's not that there is some magic transition point where people turn from strangers to friends; it's a slow and often bumpy process,'' said Tom\u225\'00\'E1s R. Jim\u233\'00\'E9nez, a \uc2 Stanford\uc2  sociologist who studies immigration in the Midwest. ''It's people becoming less strange over time as they run into each other more, and in more realms of life.''\par \par \uc2 The often-subtle shift can be seen in the Westside neighborhood of Kansas City, Mo., where police officers report that crime has fallen now that they have traded zero-tolerance enforcement for giving undocumented day laborers a place to gather. It can be seen in Denison, Iowa, where city officials built soccer fields for immigrants to keep them from ruining grass outside the high school; and in St. Thomas More Catholic Church in Tulsa, Okla., where older white choral members decided to stay in their church, often gritting their teeth, as their congregation became 90 percent Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 Despite the stunning recent primary loss of Representative \uc2 Eric Cantor\uc2  of Virginia to a more conservative Republican challenger who emphasized his tough stance on illegal immigration, a stream of polls in recent years suggest accommodation has become more common. In a recent \uc2 New York Times\uc2  survey, conducted in May, a wide majority (66 percent) said that most recent immigrants contribute to this country, up from 49 percent in 2010. State legislatures also passed more laws last year extending rights to immigrants without legal status (for driver's licenses, for example) than those adding restrictions.\par \par \uc2 Still, for many Americans, the new reality of immigrants, illegal and not, becoming rooted in their communities remains difficult to accept. Voters in Fremont, Neb., continue to support a rental law similar to that of Farmers Branch, and in February, a mural in Wichita, Kan., that says ''Immigration is Beautiful'' was defaced with graffiti.\par \par \uc2 Daniel Stein\uc2 , president of the \uc2 Federation for American Immigration Reform\uc2 , which favors reducing immigration, said many Americans still strongly oppose legalization for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally because they feel that life in the United States ''is a precious asset that should be not be handed out easily.''\par \par \uc2 And yet, here and elsewhere, many people say they are tired of the political debate -- and are adapting. ''I think we're having to give in to things that we might have wanted to take a little stronger stance to,'' said Sue Moore, 76, one of the longtime Farmers Branch residents Mr. Koch met knocking on doors. ''I feel resigned,'' she added. ''I think we're all evolving.''\par \par \uc2 Changes in Farmers Branch\par \par \uc2 Between houses, Mr. Koch, a 53-year-old lanky redhead with a soft drawl, explained his hometown's immigration evolution. He said that when he ran for the City Council in 2007, frustration was peaking as angry longtime residents complained about empty storefronts, and thousands of immigrants crowding into aging apartment complexes.\par \par \uc2 When the City Council approved a tough anti-illegal-immigration resolution in 2006 -- and when voters approved the law to fine landlords renting to immigrants without legal status a year later -- Mr. Koch said city officials were convinced that Farmers Branch was at the vanguard of a movement.\par \par \uc2 ''There was some hope and expectation that there would have been many more cities that would have jumped on board and said, 'We're a grass-roots effort,' '' Mr. Koch said.\par \par \uc2 But, he pointed out, it never happened. ''We had a lot of people behind the scenes saying, 'You go girl,' but they weren't going to step out and do it themselves,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge suspended the ordinance nine days after voters approved it. It was later struck down, but the conflict was far from over.\par \par \uc2 Tim O'Hare, the councilman who first proposed the measure, continued to defend it after he was elected mayor in 2008. He also successfully pushed Farmers Branch to join the federal program giving the local police the power to check status for those detained.\par \par \uc2 In City Council meetings, tempers often flared as Hispanic business owners, like Elizabeth Villafranca, a Mexican-American transplant from California, argued that the city's approach criminalized not just immigrants but also Hispanics who were American citizens. Legal plumbers, electricians and other laborers from all over the Dallas area refused to do work in Farmers Branch, she said, because they did not want to be stopped by the police.\par \par \uc2 And as the cost of defending the ordinance rose into the millions (the exact amount is in dispute), many residents who had supported the local position on immigration began to have second thoughts.\par \par \uc2 Monica Wenthold, 57, a college administrator, said she was initially sympathetic to the ordinance because her son had been in three car accidents between 1998 and 2000 with immigrants who lacked insurance.\par \par \uc2 The court's ruling changed her mind. ''As soon as it was turned down by a judge, I was like, O.K., stop,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Disputes over perceived racism wearied others. Mr. Koch said he was ''surprised at how careful you have to be about what you say,'' noting that his own statements were often seen as anti-Hispanic rather than pro-law-and-order.\par \par \uc2 Webber Baker, 57, a teacher, was bothered when the political debate turned harsher. He recalled meeting a fellow resident who, in his impassioned support of the city's approach, stopped talking about illegal immigration and just started complaining about Mexicans.\par \par \uc2 ''It was this subconscious thing for him, but I noticed,'' Mr. Baker said. ''Until then, I didn't realize it was this bad.''\par \par \uc2 A Church in Transition\par \par \uc2 Mixed feelings have accompanied large influxes of immigrants in cities and suburbs all the way up I-35, and government is by no means the only institution being forced to cope and adapt.\par \par \uc2 In east Tulsa, at St. Thomas More Catholic Church, the transition from a mostly white parish of a few hundred to a congregation of 10,000 members, 90 percent of them Hispanic, has led to resentment directed sometimes at immigrants, but also at those who made different decisions about how to respond.\par \par \uc2 The church hit a turning point a few years ago when the local bishop suggested that the English-speaking population release the church to the surge of Hispanic parishioners and start a new one. Some longtime members decided to leave.\par \par \uc2 Others, including many older parishioners present at the church's founding in the 1970s, stayed. Many said they often feel frustrated by immigrant neighbors who, in their view, drive too aggressively and ignore English-speakers.\par \par \uc2 But some also said that they had been even more disappointed by those congregants who stopped coming to the church because they felt that Hispanics had invaded their parish and their community.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know why everybody left,'' said Jack Ireland, 91, a World War II veteran who volunteers regularly at the church. ''What are they afraid of?''\par \par \uc2 Many still feel conflicted. When asked about those who now attend other churches, including her son, Mary Stika -- helping out at the church office, as she has for decades -- had to wipe a tears from her deep blue eyes. Asked if she felt abandoned, she nodded.\par \par \uc2 She said she has stayed because the church still feels like her spiritual home. But she has stopped teaching catechism because the children are all Hispanic and seem less interested. And instead of helping bring people together, she said, the bishop recently announced that he planned to move St. Thomas's main English-speaking priest to another parish.\par \par \uc2 ''We know it's God's church,'' Ms. Stika said. ''But we were kind of the first ones here. We've just kind of been taken over.''\par \par \uc2 In Farmers Branch, too, many longtime residents have struggled with the feeling of being slowly overwhelmed. The city of about 30,000 is now 45 percent Hispanic and 22 percent foreign born. Politics lags the demographics; there were only about 1,300 registered Hispanic voters when the 2007 ordinance passed.\par \par \uc2 But for people like Mr. Koch, a father of three whose parents moved to Farmers Branch in 1957, the political landscape has changed. Mr. O'Hare, the former councilman who pushed for anti-immigration laws, moved out of town a few years ago.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the city elected its first Hispanic member of the City Council after a federal judge forced Farmers Branch to create single-member districts because the city's at-large council election system discriminated against Hispanics, violating the Voting Rights Act.\par \par \uc2 In 2007, Mr. Koch's supporters printed T-shirts saying ''Stop the Illegal Invasion.''\par \par \uc2 Today, his campaign platform, emphasizing code enforcement and higher-end development, still strikes his critics as ''anti-immigrant lite.''\par \par \uc2 But as he heads into a runoff election on Saturday against Bob Phelps -- the former mayor who opposed the local immigration laws -- he now admits that some of those critics were right about local immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 ''They were ahead of me by saying it's too big an issue for a municipality,'' Mr. Koch said.\par \par \uc2 Now, he and former rivals, like Ms. Villafranca, speak ill of each other less often in public.\par \par \uc2 Despite years or rancor, he said he even publicly welcomed the grand opening of her new restaurant, Four Corners, a cafe that has become a meeting place for both immigrants and established residents trying to move beyond the past few years.\par \par \uc2 At times, in the prelude to the election, he even seemed to be seeking to bridge the immigration divide. At the last house he visited, he met David Caviglia, 56, an airline pilot and a libertarian who said the town's immigrants ''aren't going anywhere, so why worry about it.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Koch, for the first time all night, tried to explain. He referred to Mrs. Moore, whose frustration, he said, seemed to be more about the nation's debt -- and the federal government's inability to reduce it -- than about illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 ''It's easier to lash out at something that's close by,'' Mr. Koch said. ''Her frustration is more deep seated in that our government is failing to really address the issues -- and illegal immigration is an easy target.''\par \par \uc2 In Tulsa, Okla., Gloria Perez, left, and Joyce Shank at a Mass in English at St. Thomas More Catholic Church, which is now 90 percent Hispanic.; Four Corners, a cafe in Farmers Branch, Tex., has become a meeting place for immigrants and established  residents trying to move beyond conflict in the city of 30,000 people, 45 percent of whom are Hispanic.; David Koch, a candidate for mayor of Farmers Branch, says that laws he supported in 2007 to thwart immigrants  are a thing of the past. ''We're done,'' he said. ''This anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  stuff is behind us.''

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TULSA, Okla. -- Ignacio, a father of four, bounces along in his pickup truck, driving at exactly the speed limit through an aging suburb. The clock says 6:44 a.m. Religious pendants hang off the mirror. His teenage son sits beside him, chatty if half-awake, as they approach an apartment building for a day of roofing in dire heat.\par \par \uc2 A police cruiser suddenly appears to the right. Ignacio stays quiet, hands on the wheel, but in his mind he repeats the prayer that covers his 12 years living here illegally: ''No me pare, no me pare'' -- ''Don't stop me, don't stop me.''\par \par \uc2 ''We used to have such a comfortable life, money to pay for our house, the car, to go wherever we wanted,'' Ignacio says, referring to a time before Oklahoma's 2007 law against illegal immigrants forced him to close his successful hair salon. ''Now we are biting our nails, trying to make enough money every month.''\par \par \uc2 The routines of life as an immigrant in the country illegally now vary widely by location -- perhaps more than ever. Last year 11 states, including California and Utah, passed laws permitting illegal immigrants to obtain drivers licenses, while 15 states now let immigrant students pay in-state tuition regardless of legal status, up from 11 in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Some other states have followed a different path. Oklahoma led the way in 2007 with legislation that made it a crime to knowingly shelter or transport unauthorized immigrants, while preventing them from obtaining licenses, credentials and public benefits. It was the first sweeping state effort to discourage illegal immigration, and advocates for the approach -- which has been expanded here and exported to a few other states -- argue that it improves quality of life for legal residents and citizens.\par \par \uc2 ''Every time you have people coming over from different cultures that don't assimilate with the American culture, they develop an underground culture,'' said Maj. Shannon Clark, a spokesman for the \uc2 Tulsa County Sheriff's Office\uc2 . ''These people will try to generate revenue and gain money and do things that are in total conflict with the law.''\par \par \uc2 But Oklahoma's restrictions did not reduce Oklahoma's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population, census figures show. While some families fled, others came and tens of thousands more -- like Ignacio and his family, who requested that only their first names be used -- have stayed put, hiding and striving in the shadows.\par \par \uc2 Tulsa is an especially tough place to pull that off. Even by Oklahoma's standards, it is known as a vigilant city, with a suburban lifestyle that requires driving to work and a sheriff's office that has made immigration enforcement a high priority.\par \par \uc2 Legal immigrants and criminals here have also found ways to use the law to their advantage. Ignacio says he has lost more than $100,000 to frauds he never reported to the police, fearing deportation. And it was a former employer and new competitor -- a Mexican woman with legal status -- who forced him to shut down his salon by reporting to inspectors that he lacked a Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 ''The legal ones without compassion are the worst,'' said Maria, Ignacio's wife.\par \par \uc2 Dad\par \par \uc2 The alarm clock honks at 6 a.m. -- and for a few minutes more -- before Ignacio comes out of his bedroom in baggy shorts and a T-shirt. Groggy and darkly tanned from long days on rooftops, he collapses into a kitchen chair as Maria collects 10 cans of V8 energy drinks to keep him and their oldest son, Jos\u233\'00\'E9, hydrated at work.\par \par \uc2 ''Coffee?'' she asks. Ignacio shakes his head. He grabs a bag of bean and cheese sandwiches on wheat bread and heads to his truck, which is just a few years old. Despite the fact that money is tight, nice cars and cellphones are important. ''If you have a nice car, they treat you well,'' he says, referring to the police. ''If you drive an old, ugly car, they stop you and arrest you.''\par \par \uc2 The journey to the job site lasts less than 20 minutes. A police officer is looking at his cellphone as they drive past, leaving Ignacio and Jos\u233\'00\'E9 to meet up with a crew of eight other Hispanic men. A maintenance supervisor from the apartment complex waves good morning.\par \par \uc2 ''This is the best crew you can have,'' he says.\par \par \uc2 Ignacio and Jos\u233\'00\'E9 climb a tall ladder, then get to work cleaning the roof. They are sweating within the first hour. ''It's tough work, especially with the heat,'' Ignacio says. He turns away from the sun and yells for someone to bring him shears to cut the heavy-duty plastic they are laying down over the old tar.\par \par \uc2 He would much rather be trimming hair. Ignacio, 40, comes from a long line of barbers in Zacatecas, an old silver city in central Mexico, and he often says he has ''hair-cutting in his blood.'' He used to make a good living at it here in Tulsa, working first at a salon on the heavily Hispanic east side, then opening his own shop where he and his wife together made up to $700 a day.\par \par \uc2 But then they ran into trouble. Ignacio said that his boss at the first salon had refused to give him a 1099 form so he could pay his taxes, so when he opened his own salon in January of 2004, and voluntarily paid the taxes he owed, he attracted attention to his previous employer who, in retaliation, directed state inspectors to his new business.\par \par \uc2 When Oklahoma's \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  law arrived three years later, the visits intensified. He tried to renew his barber's license, but was rebuffed; the Oklahoma Cosmetology Board had ruled that proof of legal status was required for every credential the state issued.\par \par \uc2 Ignacio shut down the shop in 2008. He said he turned to roofing only after being cheated by other immigrants in other ways. His secondhand toy store ran aground when a supplier took his money and never delivered a trailer full of merchandise. A promised shipment of Christmas trees arrived after Christmas. The couple considered returning to Mexico, but decided they would stay for the children's education.\par \par \uc2 In 2009, he said, life's burdens and failures began to make him suicidal. When his mother died that year, and he could not go home because he knew he could not return the way he came in, with a tourist visa, he wrote a note to his wife asking her to take good care of the children.\par \par \uc2 ''You are the only one they have,'' he wrote. ''Pray to God for me.''\par \par \uc2 Mom and the Children\par \par \uc2 Sitting at a table outside the one-story house the couple bought nine years ago, Maria holds up the note. It is on the back of a sign, and the children have colored over parts of the writing. ''I don't know why I kept it,'' she says, trying to laugh.\par \par \uc2 There are other documents as well: a scrap of paper with the name and phone number of the person who was supposed to get them visas; a letter from an inspector with the state Board of Cosmetology naming Ignacio's former employer as the source of a complaint; another from the \uc2 Oklahoma Tax Commission\uc2  indicating, seven months later, that he had complied with all state income tax requirements.\par \par \uc2 The photos in the pile show the couple's old salon -- Maria and Ignacio on the day it opened, then later, when snapshots of satisfied clients covered the wall. She pulls out a picture of a new Hummer. ''He was going to paint it over with the name of the salon,'' she says.\par \par \uc2 She laughs again. ''V\u225\'00\'E1manos, hijas,'' she says, calling to her three daughters. The younger two, Michelle, 10, and Cointa, 6, are American citizens born in Tulsa. They pile into the family S.U.V. as Maria rolls down the windows, making a joke about avoiding air-conditioning to save money. The temperature is over 90.\par \par \uc2 Her first stop is the grocery store where -- after parking carefully within the yellow lines -- Maria spends $16.41 on bread and other items. Most of the customers are Hispanic or Asian.\par \par \uc2 Next, she stops at a store with a sign out front that says ''pay your bills here.'' She hands cash to a woman in a \uc2 Western Union\uc2  shirt, for cable and electricity. ''I used to pay by check,'' she says afterward, holding two of her daughters' hands, ''back when we had a bank account.''\par \par \uc2 Into the S.U.V. yet again, for a short drive to \uc2 Dollar Tree\uc2  for cleaning supplies, including soap to make sure the vehicles look good as new, then to \uc2 Walgreen's\uc2  for Gatorade. This is the only store that requires English and Alejandra, 16, translates. The first thing she does is make sure the clerk complies with the sale prices of six bottles for $5.\par \par \uc2 At home, after a roundabout route to avoid the police, Alejandra shows off her immaculate bedroom. The closet is well organized; the bed made. She plays the violin, and like her mother, she keeps important records: her membership in the National Honor Society, a ''student of the month'' certificate from sixth grade.\par \par \uc2 Like many other children of parents who are in the country illegally, she seems to feel that doing well will help make the United States more accepting.\par \par \uc2 ''My parents can only take us a certain part of the way,'' Alejandra says, warming up lunch for her father and brother. ''We have to go the extra mile.''\par \par \uc2 But there are limits. A group of boys threw bottles of urine at her and a friend a few months ago, and the family decided not to press charges because it would have meant a trip to court. When Jos\u233\'00\'E9, 19, who was born in Mexico, recently asked a military recruiter to find out if he could join now that he has the right to work with the deferred action program that applies to some children brought here illegally, the recruiter never called back.\par \par \uc2 For Jos\u233\'00\'E9 in particular, the past few years have been a rough introduction to American law and order. He had gotten used to having money, time, a girlfriend -- not thinking about his illegal status -- until he accompanied his mother to an appointment at a hospital affiliated with \uc2 Oklahoma State University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She needed to have her gall bladder removed, and an emergency room doctor had referred her to a specialist. But the hospital refused, the family said, because it received state funds and Oklahoma's 2007 immigration law bars immigrants without legal status from receiving benefits.\par \par \uc2 Even when Jos\u233\'00\'E9 explained that his father would pay cash, they did not admit her. ''What I expected from reality,'' Jos\u233\'00\'E9 said, ''it's not what happened.''\par \par \uc2 Maria eventually got the surgery at a private hospital -- with a bill of $11,000. Ignacio says they are still paying it off, $50 a month. A spider bite he suffered on a rooftop a few months ago added another medical bill of about $4,000.\par \par \uc2 Ignacio is proud to be paying these, just as he is proud not to have asked for food stamps for his citizen children.\par \par \uc2 And at times now, the family can see reason for hope. Jos\u233\'00\'E9 has secured a scholarship for the local community college. At night, they all usually trickle into the sanctuary of St. Thomas More Catholic Church for choral practice. Ignacio smiles more with a songbook in his hand. Jos\u233\'00\'E9 sings a few solos, raising his voice to the ceiling, his dark eyes at peace.\par \par \uc2 But the relief is never permanent. Tomorrow means another stressful drive to a 13-hour day on a scorching rooftop. Winter will eventually come again, the outdoor work will end. And the worry about being deported lingers.\par \par \uc2 ''You think about it all the time,'' Ignacio said. ''You are always aware of that danger.''\par \par \uc2 Top, driving is a risk for Ignacio, because any stop by a police officer could result in deportation.  Above, from left, Cointa, Maria, Ignacio, Alejandra and Michelle, ready for Sunday dinner. (A9); Jos\u233\'00\'E9 and Ignacio stop at a convenience store on the way to work. Ignacio and his wife, Maria, brought Jos\u233\'00\'E9 and a daughter, Alejandra, with them when they came to the United States 12 years ago.; Top, Jos\u233\'00\'E9 and Ignacio at work on a roof with a crew of eight other Hispanic men; above left, Maria gets ready  for Sunday Mass as her daughter Cointa plays with her hair; above right, Ignacio at Mass. The family's two  younger daughters, Cointa, 6, and Michelle, 10, were both born in the United States and are citizens.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc74}{\*\bkmkend toc74}\b \uc2 A Late Rush to Sign Up for Insurance\b0\par\par\uc2 By ROBERT PEAR   \par \uc2 1,036 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 May 2014\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The number of people signing up for health insurance through the federal marketplace soared in March, exceeding the number who signed up in the previous five months, the Obama administration said Thursday in its final report on enrollment under the new health care law.\par \par \uc2 The report, for the first time, provided information about the racial and ethnic backgrounds of those signing up. Of the 3.8 million people in the federal exchange who voluntarily disclosed such information, 63 percent were white, 17 percent were black, 11 percent were Hispanic and 8 percent were Asian, officials said.\par \par \uc2 Of the more than eight million people who have bought insurance on the federal and state exchanges, 2.2 million, or 28 percent, were 18 to 34 years old. Insurers covet people in that age bracket because they tend to be healthier and file fewer claims than older consumers. Young adults accounted for nearly one-third of people signing up after March 1.\par \par \uc2 The numbers reported on Thursday include people who selected health plans through the March 31 deadline, as well as people who were allowed to finish applications after that date because they had been stymied in earlier efforts to enroll. The administration was generous in granting extra time to people who needed it, and this policy paid off in higher enrollment numbers. About 7.1 million people had selected health plans by the March deadline. From April 1 to 19, another 910,500 people were allowed to sign up.\par \par \uc2 The new report documents the dimensions of the March surge. In the final weeks of the open enrollment period, the total number of people signed up on the federal exchange more than doubled, to 5.4 million people, from 2.6 million at the end of February. And the total on state exchanges increased 59 percent, to 2.6 million.\par \par \uc2 States with the most residents selecting plans through the exchanges during the six-month open enrollment period were California (1.4 million), Florida (983,775), Texas (733,757), New York (370,451), North Carolina (357,584), Pennsylvania (318,077) and Georgia (316,543).\par \par \uc2 California and New York run their own exchanges. The other five use the federal marketplace.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials said they did not know how many of the people signing up had paid their initial premiums. Without payment, consumers will not have coverage.\par \par \uc2 The administration noted that the eight million people who signed up for insurance included ''those who have paid a premium and those who have not yet paid a premium.''\par \par \uc2 Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, offered an upbeat interpretation of the numbers, which exceeded the administration's original goal to sign up seven million people on the exchanges.\par \par \uc2 ''In addition,'' Ms. Sebelius said, ''over 4.8 million more people have been covered by states through Medicaid'' and the related Children's Health Insurance Program. About three million under age 26 are covered under their parents' plans, she said, ''and recent estimates show that an additional five million people have purchased coverage outside of the marketplace in Affordable Care Act-compliant plans.''\par \par \uc2 ''Together,'' she said, ''we are ensuring that health coverage is more accessible than ever before, which is important for families, for businesses and for the nation's health and well-being.''\par \par \uc2 Nearly 3.8 million people selected plans on the federal and state exchanges after March 1. They account for 47 percent of all the people who signed up in the open enrollment period.\par \par \uc2 The administration said that ''enrollment has doubled since March 1'' in more than a dozen states, including Texas, Georgia and Florida.\par \par \uc2 Those selecting health plans on the federal exchange included 403,600 Latinos, nearly 626,000 African-Americans and 298,500 Asian-Americans. Among Latinos, 171,600 were in Texas and 106,600 in Florida.\par \par \uc2 In the 36 states served by the federal exchange, the number of Latinos who signed up was about three-fourths of the eligible uninsured Hispanic population, as defined by the administration.\par \par \uc2 Mayra E. Alvarez, associate director of the administration's Office of Minority Health, acknowledged that the number of Latinos picking health plans was lower than the eligible population, but said that Hispanic enrollment was nevertheless ''an important first step forward.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Alvarez said that enrollment might have been adversely affected by the immigration concerns of ''mixed-status families.'' Such families may, for example, include an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parent, ineligible for coverage on the exchange, and children who are United States citizens and therefore eligible.\par \par \uc2 About 85 percent of those who selected plans on the exchanges qualified for financial assistance in the form of tax credits to help pay premiums. Women outnumbered men, accounting for 54 percent of the people who selected plans on the exchanges.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials said they did not know how many of the people signing up were previously uninsured. Only 13 percent of those seeking financial assistance on the federal exchange said they had insurance at the time they applied. But the administration said this figure was not a reliable guide to insurance status. Federal application forms do not identify people who lost coverage recently or were about to lose it. Moreover, the report said, ''estimates of the share of previously uninsured vary widely among surveys.''\par \par \uc2 In any event, Michael Hash, the director of the Office of Health Reform at the Health and Human Services Department, said he was confident that ''premiums will be stable next year'' because the pool of new policyholders was ''sufficiently large and varied.''\par \par \uc2 Federal officials said they did not know if or when they might release data showing how many people had enrolled in health plans sold by each insurance company. Some states have disclosed such data.\par \par \uc2 CHARTS: Health Exchange Enrollment  Ended With a Surge: More than eight million people signed up  for private insurance in federal and state  exchanges during the initial enrollment  period, exceeding the administration's  original goal of seven million. The period  officially ran from Oct. 1 to March 31, but the  figures also include those who signed up in a  special enrollment period through April 19.

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 On a recent cloudless afternoon, a group of young comedy writers -- one in Ray-Bans and a floppy wizard hat, another in skateboard sneakers and funky jeans -- descended upon San Diego State University's palm-tree-dotted campus, brandishing copies of their latest creation: a 12-page broadsheet of lewd humor.\par \par \uc2 It was distribution day, or Distro, and staff members of The Koala, California's most reviled student publication, had 8,000 copies to hand out.\par \par \uc2 ''Come and get it, you know you want it,'' thundered Erik Luchsinger, a 21-year-old management major, in Hawaiian swim trunks, tank top and bow tie.\par \par \uc2 ''All the cool kids are reading it!'' bellowed Taylor Etchart, a senior foods and nutrition major.\par \par \uc2 ''Guaranteed to be funnier than your textbook!'' another staff writer shouted as students whizzed by on skateboards and bicycles.\par \par \uc2 The cover featured an orgy of naked women with koala heads, clutching beer bottles, injecting illicit substances and vomiting. Inside was a list of ''Top 5 Ways to Pick Up a Girl in a Burka,'' a four-step instruction guide entitled ''How Thou Shalt Use Thine Bible Pages to Roll One Holy Joint,'' and in lieu of horoscopes, there were ''Whore-o-Scopes.''\par \par \uc2 Some students accepted the paper gamely. Others were not so enthusiastic. One shouted back, ''I'm black'' and called the tabloid racist. Another turned away dismissively when offered a copy. ''Really offensive,'' she said to me. A professor snatched a pile ''to give away to the trash can.'' Sometimes, the paper is ripped up right there. Occasionally, there is spitting.\par \par \uc2 The Koala traffics in the kind of off-color banter even the writers recognize as offensive, though they also characterize its content as ''witty'' and ''artistic.'' Issues are peppered with jokes about homosexuals, Jews, Latinos, African-Americans, cancer patients and injured orphans. ''Zimmermanslaughter'' mocked the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin at the hands of a neighborhood watch coordinator. A particularly controversial issue featured a piece with the headline ''RAPE!'' It advised student rapists on what to do ''when you drunkenly realize she's conscious enough to call the cops'': ''Wipe off the blood and hide in the bushes NOW!'' ''Koala Call Outs'' are anonymous reader letters filled with slurs about students and professors, who are often named or described.\par \par \uc2 The student-run tabloid has had a controversial presence across the region -- at the \uc2 University of California, San Diego\uc2 , where it originated in 1982 and now only occasionally publishes, and at California State's San Marcos campus, where it was shuttered more than a year ago. Here at the state university system's San Diego campus, students routinely criticize the paper for promoting ''rape culture.'' Periodic editorials and campaigns denounce The Koala, including one in 2010 to persuade local businesses to discontinue advertising. Last fall, a group of students sent a letter to the university senate's Freedom of Expression Committee demanding an end to distribution on campus.\par \par \uc2 Despite all this, The Koala seems to be flourishing. It has recouped its lost advertising dollars, and revenues are up by more than 100 percent from fall 2012 (the editorial staff is not paid). For the first time, staff members are trying to sell subscriptions to graduating seniors, to foster an alumni base, and there is a beefed-up online presence. Koala coffee cups, stickers and T-shirts are in the works, and the paper set up a table during rush hour on the quad for a ''Koala Awareness'' event. Martin Beil, the business manager, says the goal is no longer just to survive but to ''fully saturate the market.''\par \par \uc2 With its hip, fanzine look, The Koala has its fans. ''Issues fly around the dorms,'' Mr. Luchsinger insisted. ''We find them in bathrooms, in libraries and in the cafeteria.'' The paper's ''enemies,'' he said, just don't get it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Luchsinger, who says he culls inspiration from satirists like Benjamin Franklin, views the tabloid as rebellious and boundary pushing. ''This is not highbrow journalism,'' he acknowledged. ''But we are still trying to do something substantial.'' The Koala's mission, he says, is to tease and tweak the campus melting pot.\par \par \uc2 Juliana Bloom, who was recently promoted to editor after Mr. Luchsinger, puts it simply: ''We're a comedy publication. It's O.K. for us to joke about serious stuff.''\par \par \uc2 Not surprisingly, detractors don't find anything funny here. ''I dread it when it comes out,'' said Susan E. Cayleff, a professor in the women's studies department, who spends class time during Distro Days discussing The Koala. ''It makes students terrified and uncomfortable and not proud to be here.''\par \par \uc2 IN 2001, A SPIRITED SCIENCE MAJOR named George Lee Liddle 3rd became editor in chief of U.C.-San Diego's Koala, courting controversy with risqu\u233\'00\'E9 content while currying favor with national free-speech activists, who rushed to the paper's aid when administrators tried to close The Koala there. After graduating, Mr. Liddle sought to expand the paper's reach. He registered The Koala as a for-profit business in 2005 and contacted students at San Diego State, where they secured student association status and office space. Briefly, the papers existed in an ambiguous universe: as both business and university organizations. Critics lobbied administrators to revoke student association status at U.C.-San Diego, and eventually at San Marcos. The conflict was moot at San Diego State. Staff members were accused of alcohol- and drug-related violations and its university affiliation pulled. Today, the paper is published off-campus.\par \par \uc2 The battles over The Koala provide a glimpse of how challenging it can be for a university to uphold its free speech mores yet still remain a civil, welcoming place for its increasingly diverse student body. San Diego State's code ''defends the expression we abhor as well as the expression we support,'' meaning The Koala can mouth off about different races and still be untouchable.\par \par \uc2 Jung Min Choi, an associate professor in the sociology department, has been one of The Koala's most vocal critics, frequently using the paper in his classes as living exhibits of racial intolerance. In 2008, an African-American professor in his department was attacked in an anonymous reader letter: ''Your dissatisfaction with being a fat, ugly and childless black woman is evident,'' read part of the letter. It accused the professor of ''preaching'' instead of ''teaching.'' Dr. Choi, who specializes in race and identity, and his colleagues approached the university's Center for Student Rights and Responsibilities about what they considered a case of faculty harassment.\par \par \uc2 ''I must say I was not actually greeted very warmly,'' he recalled.\par \par \uc2 Officials told him they had no intention of censuring the paper. ''They have a right to be here,'' Greg Block, the chief communications officer, told me. ''We don't necessarily agree with everything they publish, but that's neither here nor there.'' And when students pleaded last fall with Mark Freeman, chairman of the Freedom of Expression Committee, to help shut it down, he wrote back that ''freedom of the press is very broadly protected.''\par \par \uc2 Jimmy Talamantes, a graduate student who is Mexican-American, was one of the letter signers. He called the response disappointing. ''Students should not feel threatened by any person or organization while attending an institution of higher learning,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 TO BETTER UNDERSTAND what's so funny about The Koala, I joined the staff at one of its Sunday night meetings, in a cluttered one-bedroom apartment on the edge of the San Diego State campus. Sitting on a shag rug beneath a framed poster of the ''Seinfeld'' character Kramer, and between bites of guava cookies supplied by Mr. Luchsinger's mother, students reviewed their last issue, which was projected onto a flat-screen television. When the scan stopped on the staff box, they cackled at their pen names. The use of them angers critics, who complain that if The Koala is going to publish its targets' names, the staff ought to use real names, too.\par \par \uc2 ''Who's Toilet?'' someone asked, reading off one of the bylines. The room chortled.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Luchsinger talked finances, then consulted the group on the paper's fraying relationship with the university's Afrikan Student Union. ''Do you guys think it would be a good idea to have them come over here and write white people jokes for us?'' he asked. The idea was tabled after a brief discussion and more chuckles.\par \par \uc2 Later, a cluster of students crafted a limerick about the student body president, who spent his early years in a homeless shelter. Mr. Luchsinger said the president's oft-told story had a phony, ''after-school special'' quality to it, and couldn't be missed as fodder for comedy.\par \par \uc2 The meeting built to a crescendo as the students tossed out ideas for one of the trademark features: ''Top 5's.'' They jotted down possibilities for ''Top 5 Things to Wear to a Gay Pride Parade'' and ''Top 5 Reasons to Marry an \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2 ,'' including, as one student shouted out, ''You get a free housekeeper.'' Or ''Cheap labor is now free.'' Or ''She expects the abuse.'' Responses elicited peals of laughter. ''Can someone just say we are all going to hell?'' one student said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Liddle swears his prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9s are not filled with misogyny or racial animus -- about half of the 25 or so staff members are women, and a handful are Asian- or Mexican-American. Their motives are pragmatic, he said: They want experience with a media outlet. Many of the staff members told me they aspire to work for television, an online magazine or media start-up.\par \par \uc2 They said that when they first read The Koala, they were relieved to find others with a similar sensibility. ''I found people who share my sick sense of humor,'' Mr. Etchart said. He calls it ''dark satire.'' The no-holds-barred approach also appealed to Emmilly Nguyen, a freshman journalism major. Around Koala staff members, she said, ''I could be myself.'' Mr. Luchsinger plays up the bond that staff members share. While reputed to be hard-partying renegades, he said, a surprising number have a hard time finding places to fit in. ''There is this constant insider joke that we are basically a group of misfits who are awkward and weird,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 I asked Lisa Wade, chairwoman of the sociology department at \uc2 Occidental College\uc2 , who studies campus culture, why young people might see humor in the hurtful. Dr. Wade noted that most college students have been reared on unvarnished satire, much of it untidy and cruel. ''Family Guy'' and comedians like Sarah Silverman and Sacha Baron Cohen have plumbed domestic violence, AIDS victims and children with special needs for comedic material. ''Generation X sort of started it,'' Dr. Wade said. ''But these guys have really grown up on it.''\par \par \uc2 Mordechai Gordon, a professor of education at \uc2 Quinnipiac University\uc2  who developed a course titled ''The Philosophy of Humor and Laughter,'' sees the desire to rebel and poke at taboo topics. ''When kids go to college, they feel like it is their time to say whatever they want and do whatever they want.'' He cites the superiority theory of humor, dating back to Plato. ''Making fun of racial stereotypes has a long history -- maybe it's more in your face now. You don't even have to believe that Irish people like to get drunk or Poles aren't smart to think the jokes are funny. We feel superior.''\par \par \uc2 While The Koala has considerable enemies, it also has surprising allies, like Kevin Torres, a Mexican-American business major, who says he appreciates the way it makes light of stereotypes that can have hints of truth to them. He found the Koala takedown of Mexican house cleaners particularly entertaining. ''I think it's pretty hilarious,'' he said, folding over with laughter. ''When you're Mexican, it's very hard to get offended. You have to have humor. Yes, my mother cleans houses.''\par \par \uc2 The Koala is not the only publication to mine edgy terrain. A subgroup of campus publications -- The Quinnipiac Barnacle, The Medium at Rutgers and The Texas Travesty at the \uc2 University of Texas, Austin\uc2  -- delight in routinely touching humor's third rail.\par \par \uc2 Take The Medium. Last year, it was criticized for likening a sorority with dwindling membership to a gaggle of farm animals. The motto: ''Ugliness Acceptable.'' So loud was the outcry that staff members posted a speedy apology on their \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page. In 2012, officials released a statement condemning The Medium for a column defending Hitler that it falsely attributed to a Jewish activist on campus.\par \par \uc2 Ronald Miskoff, then faculty adviser, is not a fan of administrative intervention. He thinks students should be given the space to figure out where the line between funny and cruel is, even if that means allowing them to make bad calls. ''Otherwise you have censorship,'' he said, ''and what's the next stop on that bus?''\par \par \uc2 Staff members at The Brown Noser, founded in 2006 at \uc2 Brown University\uc2 , set their own limits. ''We don't write anything that feels classist or racist,'' said Louisa Kellogg, an editor. Also on the no-go list: gross stuff, juvenile humor, and headlines that resemble ones in The Onion. At The Colonel, the \uc2 University of Kentucky\uc2 's satire broadsheet, public officials are fair game, private citizens not so much. ''Usually what we tell staff members is: If you \uc2 Google\uc2  them and their name comes up all over the place, they're game,'' said Nicole Schladt, an editor.\par \par \uc2 But what of publications that don't monitor themselves? Dr. Choi believes that's when universities ought to step in. Administrators have a responsibility, he said, to ''uphold not just legal behavior but ethical behavior as well, and some common sense about what is and isn't funny.'' He added: ''When administrators don't take a stand, it is almost as if they are supporting what these people are saying.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Freeman interprets the university's silence differently. ''If we were able to ban any speech we didn't like, we'd have very little debate,'' he said. ''For me, this is a teachable moment about the consequences and burdens of living in a democracy.''\par \par \uc2 Kyle Spencer's last article for Education Life was about the Muslim fraternity Alpha Lambda Mu.\par \par \uc2 ALL THE VIEWS UNFIT TO PRINT: (BY US) Expurgated  front page of The Koala, a student-run tabloid at  San Diego State University that traffics in off-color  banter and slurs on students and professors.

Julia Preston contributed reporting from New York.   \par \uc2 1,652 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 March 2014\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The cellblock intercom awoke Josue Noe Sandoval-Perez at 1 o'clock on a frigid January morning at a detention center in northwest Missouri: Get your things, get ready to go. Immigration officials were preparing to whisk him away.\par \par \uc2 A day earlier the government denied an appeal of his deportation order, but no one told his family, nor was he allowed to call.\par \par \uc2 So while Mr. Sandoval-Perez, 41, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a previous deportation on his record, was beginning his journey back to his native Mexico, his family was clinging to hope at a rally in a park here. Holding signs, they argued that he had been in the country for 16 years, had no criminal record, paid taxes and was the primary breadwinner for his children -- one an American citizen, the other an immigrant who is here legally.\par \par \uc2 He was dropped off that night in Matamoros, a violence-ridden Mexican border town. When he called his wife, Josefina Aguilar, from outside a bus station to tell her what happened, gunshots could be heard.\par \par \uc2 ''I was just crying a lot, like my world was over,'' Ms. Aguilar, 40, recalled.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sandoval-Perez's case -- as described by him, his family and court documents -- previews the difficulties President Obama will face in a review he ordered last week, asking the Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, to come up with a more ''humane'' deportation policy.\par \par \uc2 Like Mr. Sandoval-Perez, many immigrants here illegally might qualify for protection from deportation if strong ties to family and community and steady work records were taken into account, but they also have past immigration violations that could count heavily against them.\par \par \uc2 The review comes too late to help Mr. Sandoval-Perez. But his case was among dozens that immigrant advocates presented to the White House last Friday as an example of how Mr. Obama's enforcement policies had torn apart generally law-abiding families, separating breadwinning parents from children who have known no other country but the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''Josue is a perfect example of a case that they should have exercised prosecutorial discretion on,'' said \uc2 Richard Morales\uc2 , the detention prevention coordinator at the \uc2 PICO National Network\uc2 , an organization of faith-based community groups. ''We welcome the news from the president, but we need to see details.''\par \par \uc2 In an interview at an apartment that he shares with his sister-in-law in Mexico City, Mr. Sandoval-Perez was more pointed about what he wanted from Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 ''He has the power to end this discrimination, to change this,'' said Mr. Sandoval-Perez, holding a blue plastic folder with all his deportation documents. ''Families have to stop being separated.''\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials declined to comment on the specifics of their decision not to grant Mr. Sandoval-Perez leniency. A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement that the agency's deportation priorities included ''convicted criminals, immigration fugitives and those apprehended at the border while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States.''\par \par \uc2 She added that the agency had begun to take a hard look at whether it could further align its enforcement policies with the ''goal of sound law enforcement practice that prioritizes public safety,'' which could mean more leniency for some immigrants with prior deportations.\par \par \uc2 A study released on Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found that federal court convictions of immigrants who returned illegally after deportation -- like Mr. Sandoval-Perez -- had increased 28-fold over the past two decades, from 690 in 1992 to 19,463 in 2012. That rise accounts for nearly half the growth of all federal convictions over that time span, the report said.\par \par \uc2 But for now, as immigration overhaul efforts have stalled in Congress, the Obama administration has found itself having to adjudicate cases that present compelling arguments for and against deportation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sandoval-Perez, whose shaved head and hulking frame appeared intimidating until he cried at every mention of his daughter, acknowledged that he first tried to cross the border illegally with a green card that belonged to someone else in October 1998.\par \par \uc2 But he barely set foot into the country then. American officials stopped him at the border entrance to El Paso and did an expedited removal, which is legally a deportation. Two days later, he successfully crossed, meeting his wife and infant son, Erik, who had also entered illegally a few days earlier.\par \par \uc2 Holding Mr. Sandoval-Perez's previous deportation against him violates the spirit of the system, argued David Leopold, a Cleveland-based immigration lawyer, because the guideline is intended to target ''somebody who serially re-enters the country, who doesn't have any ties to the United States.''\par \par \uc2 ''They need to use their common sense,'' Mr. Leopold said of immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 If the immigration bill that passed the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2  last year were law, Mr. Leopold said, Mr. Sandoval-Perez could have been eligible for amnesty.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Jessica M. Vaughan\uc2 , director of policy studies for the \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2 , a group that advocates less immigration and opposes the Senate bill, said that Mr. Sandoval-Perez's case bolstered the argument for focusing on tougher immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 ''To me it shows the importance of having other programs in place that deter illegal settlement so that fewer people are able to stay here for that long a period of time and build a life here before being ordered removed,'' Ms. Vaughan said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sandoval-Perez's son, Erik, now 17, has a legal deportation reprieve under a 2012 Obama administration program. Erik, a high school junior, avidly plays the video game Call of Duty, fixes cars (which he learned from his father) and works at a clothing store. Mr. Sandoval-Perez's daughter, Nayelly, 12, who was born in the United States, is a blossoming basketball star who learned the game from her father.\par \par \uc2 Both fought back tears as they recently spoke about their father, in the white trailer decorated with images of Jesus and Our Lady of Guadalupe where they live on the eastern edge of Kansas City. Nayelly recalled playing a basketball game the night she found out her father had been deported.\par \par \uc2 ''Every time I would get the ball, I couldn't even dribble,'' she said. ''I couldn't even, like, make a shot.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sandoval-Perez and his wife say they came to the United States because they could not make a living wage in Mexico. They settled in Kansas City, where Mr. Sandoval-Perez worked in cabinet factories and, most recently, at a scrap yard. Last April, he said, he took coins from some of the cars in the scrap yard to a machine at a grocery store that converts change into bills. The machine jammed, police officers approached him and asked him for identification and where he worked. He told them everything, he said. They did not take any action against him.\par \par \uc2 But in January, officers showed up at the scrap yard and arrested him on a misdemeanor theft charge for using damaged currency in the machine.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sandoval-Perez was one of several people arrested after an investigation by the department's fraud unit, a spokesman for the Kansas City Police Department said. Mr. Sandoval-Perez had several pieces of identification with different names on them, the spokesman said, so they called immigration officials to verify his identity, which led to his being placed on a hold.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sandoval-Perez denied that he had multiple identifications and described the arrest as ''discriminatory.''\par \par \uc2 After about a week in the city's custody during which he did not have access to a shower, he was sent to an immigration detention facility about an hour north of Kansas City. On the outside, Communities Creating Opportunity, a faith-based community advocacy organization aligned with PICO, rallied members of the local clergy, got Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, Democrat of Missouri, to write a letter in support of Mr. Sandoval-Perez's release and got a lawyer to file for a stay of deportation.\par \par \uc2 Inside, Mr. Sandoval-Perez believed he would soon be released. But, he said, in the early hours of Jan. 31 -- after the stay was denied, but before any of his supporters were notified -- he was awakened by the message on the intercom in his immigration cell. Immigration officials said he was awakened early to prepare for his deportation but was allowed to return to sleep before being transported.\par \par \uc2 The night before, he said, the authorities pressured him to sign a final deportation document, but did not give him a copy. He initially refused and said he wanted to talk to his lawyer, but the officers told him not to worry about it. ''Sign first,'' he recalled their saying, ''then you can talk to your lawyer.''\par \par \uc2 After about 10 hours in a holding area, he was flown with about 40 others to Brownsville, Tex., he said.\par \par \uc2 The authorities separated him from the group. He was sent across into Matamoros, after the other deportees, with just a brown paper bag holding his meager belongings -- his wallet, a belt, his wedding ring and his cellphone, dead from days without a charge.\par \par \uc2 Photographs of Josue Noe Sandoval-Perez and his children on the refrigerator of their home.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORAM, N.Y. -- The story unfolds roughly the same way each time: A Latino immigrant is driving a car with out-of-state license plates, and a police officer pulls him over and asks for his driver's license.\par \par \uc2 The driver, because he is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , does not have a license, so the officer tells him to step out of the car and face the other way. The officer may ask to see the driver's wallet; then he starts to search the car. After a few minutes, he hands the wallet back to the driver, tells him that everything is fine and sends him on his way.\par \par \uc2 Soon afterward, the driver discovers that money is missing from his wallet.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, at least a dozen men, all undocumented immigrants from Latin America, have told immigrants' advocates and the Suffolk County district attorney's office that they were robbed by a police officer during a traffic stop in or near this Long Island hamlet.\par \par \uc2 Most, if not all, of the incidents occurred even as the county's police department was under scrutiny by the Justice Department, advocates said.\par \par \uc2 Some of the incidents, the men have said, occurred as much as two years ago. The men said they had remained quiet until now because they feared reprisals by the police, or even deportation.\par \par \uc2 The surge of accusations commenced after the arrest of a Suffolk County police officer who, officials said, was caught on camera during a sting operation in late January stealing $100 from a Latino undercover detective.\par \par \uc2 According to a statement by the district attorney, Thomas J. Spota, the officer pulled alongside the sting vehicle ''to establish the ethnicity of the driver,'' pulled the car over, told the undercover detective to stand outside the vehicle, then checked the car. Hidden surveillance cameras caught the officer, a 25-year veteran of the department, taking a $100 bill from an envelope of cash on a seat and slipping it into the cuff of his shirt, officials said.\par \par \uc2 The officer, Sgt. Scott A. Greene, 50, has pleaded not guilty to charges of official misconduct and petty larceny. His lawyer did not reply to a request seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 The arrest has given other immigrants the confidence to step forward and make their own allegations, advocates said. The authorities have not released a photo of Sergeant Greene, so it remained unclear whether he matched the description provided by the other accusers; officials from the district attorney's office did not reply to requests for comment on the investigation.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants' advocates said the accusations were particularly alarming because most of the incidents would have occurred after the Justice Department had begun investigating allegations of discriminatory policing by the Suffolk authorities. The allegations included claims that the police not only discouraged Latino crime victims from filing complaints but also failed to investigate crimes involving Latinos.\par \par \uc2 The inquiry, which began in 2009, was spurred by the killing in November 2008 of Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant who was assaulted by a group of teenagers and stabbed to death. After that incident, other Latino residents said they, too, had been victims of racially motivated attacks but that the police had failed to thoroughly investigate many of their claims.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department and Suffolk County's police department signed an accord in December that settled the investigation and mandated the implementation of new policies to ensure nondiscriminatory policing among the Latino population and more community outreach by the police department.\par \par \uc2 Yet this scrutiny has apparently provided only a modicum of comfort to many Latino immigrants, who say they are still intensely wary and mistrustful of the police.\par \par \uc2 A Mexican worker said in an interview last week that he had been pulled over many times by the police while driving through the county. Though most stops have resulted in a ticket for driving without a license, he said, he has rarely been told what prompted the stops and he suspects he was being racially profiled.\par \par \uc2 In one of the stops, he said, he may have encountered Sergeant Greene. While driving with a friend through Coram one morning in January 2013, an officer pulled him over, the man recalled. After asking for his registration and wallet -- the driver had no license -- the officer made him step out of the car and place his hands on the trunk.\par \par \uc2 ''And don't turn around,'' the officer said, according to the man, an employee of a Long Island construction company who has lived in the area for 15 years. The officer, standing out of view behind the driver, proceeded to rifle through the wallet. Then he handed back the wallet and told the man he could leave.\par \par \uc2 The man discovered $200 missing. ''It started to happen to all my friends,'' he said. If they were not carrying money at the time of the stop, he continued, the drivers were usually sent on their way with a traffic ticket of some sort.\par \par \uc2 ''People have always been robbed but were fearful that something else would happen or that they would be sent back to their country,'' he explained.\par \par \uc2 The man told his story at the home of an acquaintance in Coram. He and several other laborers who claim to have been robbed during police stops had gathered for a meeting about the evolving case.\par \par \uc2 Several said that despite the arrest of Sergeant Greene, they remained nervous about possible reprisals for their cooperation with the authorities, and they agreed to be interviewed for this article only on the condition that they not be identified. Irma Solis, an organizer from Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group that has been finding and counseling possible victims, said fear of retribution is forefront in the minds of the accusers. ''One of their first questions is, 'How can I be sure they won't come after me?' '' she said.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers from LatinoJustice PRLDEF, an advocacy group that helped to spur the federal investigation in Suffolk County, have also been interviewing the men and recording their testimony.\par \par \uc2 ''We're concerned about how forceful and comprehensive this investigation really is,'' said Juan Cartagena, the organization's president and general counsel. ''This is the same police department that has demonstrated an inability to protect Latinos for years now.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cartagena said his team was ''studying the possibility'' of calling for the appointment of an independent prosecutor to handle the cases.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020140303ea330006r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

(Sundance) AN EDUCATION (2009) Carey Mulligan stars as Jenny, a willful, Oxford-bound 16-year-old suffering from ennui in the London suburb of Twickenham in 1961. Peter Sarsgaard is David, the older man who introduces her to a world of art auctions and Champagne while appealing to the pretensions of her proper parents (Cara Seymour and Alfred Molina). But soon it's apparent that David and his fabulous life aren't quite what they seem, though that doesn't stop Jenny from playing along. ''The filmmakers themselves seem too intoxicated by the mystique of the period to take full account of the sad, bleak aspects of the story they have to tell,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this drama directed by Lone Scherfig, written by Nick Hornby and based on a memoir by Lynn Barber. Still, he added, in the end the film is ''a pleasure -- which I don't mean entirely as a compliment.''\par \par \uc2 11 A.M. (Fox Business) FBN LIVE FROM THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW \uc2 Liz Claman\uc2  reports from Las Vegas, where her guests include \uc2 Kazuo Hirai\uc2 , the president and chief executive of Sony, and \uc2 Robert W.

(\uc2 Comedy Central\uc2 ) RUN, FATBOY, RUN (2008) A huffing and puffing security guard (Simon Pegg) enters the same marathon as the rich American boyfriend (Hank Azaria) of his former fianc\u233\'00\'E9e (Thandie Newton), whom he left on their wedding day. He wants to prove to her and their son that he can see a plan through. This kind of movie could be dismissed as ''a goofy lark,'' Matt Zoller Seitz wrote in The Times. ''But it's also a rare comedy that believes in its own message, and that could inspire the depressed and the demoralized to grit their teeth and keep running.''\par \par \uc2 8 P.M. (Fox) DADS After David (Peter Riegert) exposes Edna (Tonita Castro) as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Eli (Seth Green) forces him to marry her and persuades Warner (Giovanni Ribisi) to plan the wedding. In ''Brooklyn Nine-Nine,'' at 8:30, Jake (Andy Samberg) goes after the Pontiac Bandit, and the station must accommodate the needs of Charles (Joe Lo Truglio) when he returns to work, using a scooter. In ''New Girl,'' at 9, Jess (Zooey Deschanel) and the gang flash back to their first jobs. And in ''The Mindy Project,'' at 9:30, Mindy (Mindy Kaling) hires Danny (Chris Messina) to be her personal trainer so she can get into shape before a weekend away with Cliff (Glenn Howerton).\par \par \uc2 10 P.M. (Bravo) 100 DAYS OF SUMMER Six young Chicagoans try to accomplish their personal and professional goals in just three months in this new reality series.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- As several thousand demonstrators rallied around them, eight members of the House of Representatives were arrested on Tuesday outside the Capitol in a protest to push Congress to pass broad immigration legislation that includes a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The protests came as most attention in Congress was focused on the standoff over the partial government shutdown and the partisan disputes over health care and fiscal policy, pushing immigration to the side.\par \par \uc2 The lawmakers, all Democrats, were detained by the Capitol Police after they stood silently in a line in the middle of a street that borders the Capitol lawn, blocking traffic. As the police handcuffed them behind their backs and led them away, a crowd pressed in, chanting, ''Let them go!''\par \par \uc2 The representatives arrested were Joseph Crowley and Charles B. Rangel of New York, Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Al Green of Texas, Luis V. Gutierrez and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, Raul M. Grijalva of Arizona and John Lewis of Georgia. More than 150 other protesters, many from labor unions and immigrant organizations, were also arrested after they sat down and linked arms in the same street.\par \par \uc2 The arrests came after a rally by thousands of supporters of an immigration overhaul held in the middle of the National Mall, with a stage and live music by the Tigres del Norte, a popular Mexican-American band.\par \par \uc2 In a storm of \uc2 Twitter\uc2  posts, conservatives questioned how the immigration groups could hold a demonstration on the Mall, which is a national park, when national parks and memorials are closed as a result of the government shutdown. House Republicans have tried to reopen parks and monuments while keeping most of the federal government closed.\par \par \uc2 Conservatives said the Obama administration was showing a double standard by allowing the rally a week after World War II veterans were blocked from entering their memorial on the Mall. The veterans went in despite barricades placed there. After that, the National Park Service said veterans would be allowed to enter the memorial during the shutdown.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the Park Service said it had allowed the immigration rally as an expression of ''First Amendment rights,'' the same rationale it had provided for opening the war memorial.\par \par \uc2 ''The Mall is supposed to be shut,'' said Brad Botwin, the director of Help Save Maryland, an anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  group, who joined a handful of people at the Mall to protest the immigration demonstration. ''Why is the Park Service helping \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  groups and desperate labor unions to have a rally today?''\par \par \uc2 From the stage, Representative \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  of California, the minority leader, thanked the White House for giving permission for the rally to proceed.\par \par \uc2 At midday, House Democratic leaders broke away briefly from the tense debates inside the Capitol to tell the demonstrators that they would press for a vote on a bill in the House this year.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would support broad legislation with a ''path to earned citizenship'' for unauthorized immigrants. Democrats said they were confident there was a majority in the House, including Republicans and Democrats, to pass such a bill.\par \par \uc2 ''Let's get a vote on the floor,'' Ms. Pelosi said.\par \par \uc2 Democrats are working to put their mark on the issue with the Latino and other immigrant groups at the rally. They introduced a bill in the House last week that closely matches broad legislation passed by the Senate in June. But that bill had no Republican sponsors and seemed unlikely to advance.\par \par \uc2 Several House Republicans -- including Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both of Florida, and Jeff Denham and David Valadao, both of California -- appeared at the rally to call for bipartisan efforts to pass an immigration overhaul.\par \par \uc2 In an interview, Mr. Denham said immigration could be less divisive than the fiscal issues that led to the shutdown. He added that repairing the immigration system could be an ''economic driver'' that would help reduce the deficit.\par \par \uc2 But Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, said that given the raw feelings between the parties in the House, the prospects for action on immigration were not clear.\par \par \uc2 ''A huge majority of the American people think we ought to fix the immigration system, and we have the votes to do it,'' Ms. Lofgren said. ''But there is no vote. There is a problem here with the American democracy.''\par \par \uc2 Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois, above center, was one of eight Democratic representatives arrested Tuesday at a rally for immigration reform that drew thousands of demonstrators to the National Mall. The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, left, told the crowd that Democrats would push for a vote this year.
