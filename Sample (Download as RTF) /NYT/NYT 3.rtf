All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DAYTON, Ohio -- Fighting back from the ravages of industrial decline, this city adopted a novel plan two years ago to revive its economy and its spirits: become a magnet for immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Dayton City Commission voted to make the city ''immigrant friendly,'' with programs to attract newcomers and encourage those already here, as a way to help stem job losses and a drop in population.\par \par \uc2 In north Dayton -- until recently a post-apocalyptic landscape of vacant, gutted houses -- 400 Turkish families have moved in, many coming from other American cities. Now white picket fences, new roofs and freshly painted porches are signs of a brisk urban renewal led by the immigrants, one clapboard house at a time.\par \par \uc2 ''We want to invest in the places where we are accepted better,'' said Islom Shakhbandarov, a Turkish immigrant leader. ''And we are accepted better in Dayton.''\par \par \uc2 Other struggling cities are trying to restart growth by luring enterprising immigrants, both highly skilled workers and low-wage laborers. In the Midwest, similar initiatives have begun in Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Lansing, Mich., as well as Detroit, as it strives to rise out of bankruptcy. In June, officials from those cities and others met in Detroit to start a common network.\par \par \uc2 ''We want to get back to the entrepreneurial spirit that immigrants bring,'' said Richard Herman, a lawyer in Cleveland who advises cities on ideas for development based on immigration.\par \par \uc2 The new welcome for immigrants reflects a broader shift in public opinion, polls show, as the country leaves behind the worst of the recession. More Americans agree that immigrants, even some in the country illegally, can help the economy, giving impetus to Congressional efforts to overhaul an immigration system that many say is broken.\par \par \uc2 Concerns about uncontrolled illegal immigration, which produced strict curbs in Arizona and other parts of the country, have not been an issue in Dayton. Officials here say their goal is to invite legal immigrants. But they make no effort to pursue residents without legal status, if they are otherwise law-abiding.\par \par \uc2 The momentum for change in Dayton came from the immigrants. In 2010, Mr. Shakhbandarov told the newly elected mayor, Gary Leitzell, that he was thinking of asking Turkish immigrants across the United States to settle here. Most of the Turks in Dayton are refugees who fled persecution in Russia and other former Soviet bloc countries.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Leitzell was intrigued. ''I said, the worst thing that could happen is that 4,000 Turkish families could come to Dayton and fix up 4,000 houses,'' the mayor recalled. ''So how do we facilitate their success?''\par \par \uc2 With 14,000 empty dwellings in the city, officials were open to trying something different.\par \par \uc2 Officials quickly realized that this city of 141,000 already had a small but fast-growing foreign-born population: more than 10,000 Muslims from different countries; refugees from Burundi and Somalia; college students from China, India and Saudi Arabia; Filipinos in health care jobs; and laborers from Latin America, many here illegally.\par \par \uc2 ''The hospitals, the police, the libraries, the service agencies, the landlords, they were all dealing with immigrants, but no one was talking about it,'' said Tim Riordan, the city manager. ''So we brought it out of the shadows.''\par \par \uc2 The officials hosted many town meetings to test whether Dayton's residents were ready to be hospitable. But the only vocal resistance came from anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  groups from other Ohio cities. In October 2011, the City Commission voted unanimously for the Welcome Dayton plan.\par \par \uc2 Working with local organizations, the city found interpreters for public offices, added foreign-language books in libraries and arranged for English classes. Teachers went back to school to learn other languages.\par \par \uc2 Local groups gave courses for immigrants opening small businesses and helped families of refugees and foreign students. City officials worked with \uc2 Wright State University\uc2 , a public institution, to find ways for immigrant doctors and engineers to cut through bureaucracy and gain certifications so they could practice in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The police chief, Richard S. Biehl, ordered officers to no longer check the immigration status of crime witnesses, victims and people stopped for minor traffic violations or other low-level offenses. The police union and sheriffs from nearby counties denounced the policy, saying Dayton had become a ''sanctuary city'' where immigration law was not enforced.\par \par \uc2 But Chief Biehl defended his approach, saying it allowed the police to focus dwindling resources on serious crimes. Immigrant leaders, especially Hispanics, embraced it, becoming less wary of the police.\par \par \uc2 ''If we have any group of citizens who are afraid to talk to us or don't trust us,'' Chief Biehl said, ''that's going to compromise our ability to produce public safety.''\par \par \uc2 City officials said the whole effort cost them one salary for a program coordinator and some snacks for meetings. While it is still too early to say whether the program will jump-start an economic rebound, the early results are promising.\par \par \uc2 Turks chose Dayton, Mr. Shakhbandarov said, because the cost of living was low and there were universities nearby for their children. The newcomers have started restaurants and shops, as well as trucking companies to ferry equipment for a nearby Air Force base. And they have used their savings to refurbish houses in north Dayton, where Turkish leaders estimated that they had invested $30 million so far, including real estate, materials purchases and the value of their labor.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shakhbandarov stood proudly at the entrance of the Turkish community center that recently opened downtown, gesturing to the lobby's beige floor tiles, imported from Turkey to make visitors ''feel warm'' when they arrive. Turks bought the center, empty and dilapidated, from the city with a favorable loan. Now it houses a neighborhood preschool and martial arts classes, joined enthusiastically by girls in head scarves.\par \par \uc2 ''It's all about attitude,'' Mr. Shakhbandarov said. ''Americans maybe have seen better days of Dayton, a better life, better economy. But we never seen that. We have learned to appreciate what we have. And what we have here is much beyond what we ever had before.''\par \par \uc2 Other immigrants are busy as well. Organized by Migwe Kimemia, a Kenyan immigrant who works for the \uc2 American Friends Service Committee\uc2 , a group of Africans is working to start a roasting company in Dayton for coffee from that continent.\par \par \uc2 A Muslim organization, the Islamic Center of Peace, bought a blocklong shopping center, not far from downtown, that was so decayed the city had started to demolish it. The center's president, Ismail Gula, envisions a bustling international shopping, recreational and religious center that will serve anyone in the city.\par \par \uc2 ''I want my community to prove we are part of the community at large,'' said Mr. Gula, a longtime Dayton resident who was born in Libya.\par \par \uc2 Gabriela Pickett, who is from Mexico, runs an art gallery and haven for Hispanic immigrants and others, providing psychotherapy and social support, including for those without legal status.\par \par \uc2 ''I would be lying if I said there is no rejection in Dayton for people who are different,'' Ms. Pickett said. ''But the city has been very proactive in trying to educate people.''\par \par \uc2 African-Americans, who make up 43 percent of Dayton's population, agree with the goals of the city's program but said they were waiting to see the results. Derrick L. Foward, president of the Dayton Unit N.A.A.C.P., said he was concerned that immigrant businesses were not hiring enough black employees.\par \par \uc2 ''I think Welcome Dayton is a very good initiative,'' Mr. Foward said. ''But I would like to see more diversity hiring as part of their practice from the start.''\par \par \uc2 Recent research suggests that Dayton's experience is not accidental. In a national study published last month, Jacob L. Vigdor, an economics professor at \uc2 Duke University\uc2 , found that over the last four decades, immigrants helped preserve and in some cases add manufacturing jobs in cities where they settled, sustaining employment for Americans. They also added to local housing values. For every thousand immigrants who moved into a county, 270 Americans moved in after them, Mr. Vigdor found.\par \par \uc2 Dayton's immigrant experiment is particularly close to home for one lawmaker who will most likely have a major impact on the debate in Washington: the Republican speaker of the House, \uc2 John A. Boehner\uc2 . His district wraps around the city on three sides.\par \par \uc2 But Dayton officials said they were not waiting for Congress. ''We've found that we can repopulate our city and we can educate the people and inspire them to employ themselves,'' Mayor Leitzell said. ''In 10 years, when the federal government figures everything out, we'll be thriving.''\par \par \uc2 The Akhmedov family, top left, is one of about 400 Turkish families new to Dayton, Ohio, where restored houses signal an urban renewal. The city hopes new immigrants will lift its economy. Dayton  was already home to a growing immigrant population, including a large Muslim community, which recently opened an Islamic cemetery.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc1}{\*\bkmkend toc1}\b \uc2 National Push by a Local Immigration Activist: No G.O.P. Retreat\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON   \par \uc2 1,261 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 August 2013\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA -- He says the United States is filling up with immigrants who do not respect the law or the American way of life. He refers to Latino groups as ''the tribalists,'' saying they seek to impose a divisive ethnic agenda. Of his many adversaries, he says: ''The illegal alien lobby never changes. It's the Wall Street wing of the Republican Party joining forces with the Chamber of Commerce, the far left and the Democrats in an effort to expand cheap labor and increase voting for the Democratic Party.''\par \par \uc2 D. A. King, who quit his job as an insurance agent a decade ago to wage a full-time campaign against illegal immigration in Georgia, is one reason this state rivals Arizona for the toughest legal crackdown in the country. With his Southern manners and seersucker jackets, he works the halls of the gold-domed statehouse, familiar to all, polite and uncompromising.\par \par \uc2 Now, like other local activists around the country, he is looking beyond Georgia to stop the House of Representatives from following the Senate and passing legislation that would open a path to legal status for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 As lawmakers return to their home districts for the August recess, advocates like Mr. King are joining forces with national groups that oppose legalization and favor reduced immigration for an all-out populist push.\par \par \uc2 ''These local people live in the middle of these places, they know how to be effective in their districts,'' said \uc2 Roy Beck\uc2 , executive director of one of the largest national groups, NumbersUSA, who is now holding regular strategy calls with Mr. King and more than 50 other state advocates.\par \par \uc2 The zeal of militants like Mr. King is a problem for the House speaker, \uc2 John A. Boehner\uc2  of Ohio, and other Republican leaders, who are hoping to steer their divided caucus to pass a House version of legislation to fix the broken immigration system, which could include legal status for those who lack it -- though probably not citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Mr. King's ''respectful but firm'' message for the speaker, he said in an interview, is that ''any vote for legalization would be a matter of very great consequence for the people who voted for conservative congressmen from Georgia.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. King says his wrath grew slowly, beginning in the 1990s with a feud with Mexican neighbors who disrupted the quiet of his leafy street. In Mr. King's account, they parked fleets of run-down vehicles on their lawn and at one point housed 22 people in a jerry-built warren of rental rooms in the basement.\par \par \uc2 He took the neighbor to court over code violations, and the conflict boiled for seven years until the family moved away.\par \par \uc2 A visit in 2004 to the Southwest border convinced Mr. King that the country was facing ''what was easily described as an invasion.'' Returning to Georgia, he made \uc2 common cause\uc2  with the struggling father of a teenage boy killed in a car accident by a reckless driver who was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He named his organization the Dustin Inman Society, after the boy.\par \par \uc2 The mistrust of Mr. Boehner among Mr. King and his allies deepened recently when the speaker rebuked an anti-amnesty hero, Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, for commenting that young immigrants here illegally had ''calves the size of cantaloupes'' from running drugs across the border.\par \par \uc2 Mr. King in Georgia said he sided squarely with the congressman of the same name, although he might have chosen a milder metaphor. He nonetheless spared little in his description of Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , the Florida Republican who was one of the authors of the Senate bill, calling him a ''smarmy and dishonest'' turncoat. During the Senate debate, Mr. King designed and paid for thousands of bumper stickers as well as three large billboards along a commuter highway near Atlanta.\par \par \uc2 ''Help us stop RubiObama amnesty!'' one big sign read, with President Obama's name joined by his hallmark red-white-and-blue letter to that of Senator Rubio.\par \par \uc2 His billboards instructed drivers to call a senator from Georgia, Johnny Isakson. Mr. Isakson, who supported a comprehensive bill in 2007, voted against the Senate legislation this year.\par \par \uc2 In Georgia, Mr. King has not been afraid to take on many adversaries, including the farmers and growers, business organizations, labor unions and Latinos. A big-shouldered former Marine, he often shows up with his own placards at rallies called by his opponents -- just to let them know he is watching.\par \par \uc2 ''I was taught that we have an American culture to which immigrants will assimilate,'' Mr. King said. ''And I am incredibly resentful that's not what's happening anymore.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. King, 61, runs his one-man operation from the small guest room of his home on a tree-shaded cul-de-sac in the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, equipped with an aging desktop computer and a chair that he acknowledges ''needs a new coat of duct tape.'' He lives on small donations, and to keep it all going he spent down his savings, ran up his credit cards, refinanced his house three times and ''sold the stock my grandmother left me.''\par \par \uc2 He is unmoved by the protests of Latino and immigrant groups that the Obama administration has already done more than enough enforcement, with more than 1.6 million deportations those groups say have sown fear in their neighborhoods.\par \par \uc2 Mr. King wants a lot more enforcement before the House does anything else on immigration. He sees the Senate bill as a scheme by Democrats to create legions of new government-dependent voters for their party. He feels certain House Republicans will ultimately reject it.\par \par \uc2 ''The tribalists will not make any difference with any Republican who has enough sense to get on an airplane every Monday and fly to Washington,'' Mr. King said.\par \par \uc2 In his recent meetings in the statehouse, Mr. King huddled with two Republicans, Senator Josh McKoon and Representative Edward Lindsey, who called in by phone. They laid plans for Republicans in the state legislature to send a letter to all the Georgia lawmakers in the House, urging them to focus on enforcement and avoid legalization.\par \par \uc2 Mr. King is joining a surge of activity among his allies that was spurred by the Senate vote in June. At NumbersUSA, Mr. Beck said, more than 400,000 people signed on to an e-mail list as the vote approached, expanding its followers to more than 1.6 million names. Mr. Beck said a recent conference call he convened with followers was joined by 58,770 people.\par \par \uc2 But Jerry Gonzalez, a Latino leader in Georgia who is one of Mr. King's oldest rivals, pointed to new demographics that House lawmakers would have to consider. The number of registered Latino voters in the state grew to 184,000 in 2012 from 10,000 a decade earlier, with more than 200,000 legal immigrants eligible to become citizens.\par \par \uc2 ''If the Republican Party gets stuck with D. A. King and his extremist xenophobic narrative, they are setting themselves up for future failure,'' said Mr. Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, or Galeo.\par \par \uc2 One worrisome sign for Mr. King is that his donations are not increasing. But he is forging ahead, putting up new billboards on Georgia highways -- and planning one with the face of \uc2 John Boehner\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 D. A.

RASHBAUM; Randy Leonard and Julia Preston contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,195 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 June 2013\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 More than a dozen 7-Eleven franchises took in more than $180 million in revenue by running a ''modern-day plantation system,'' prosecutors in New York charged on Monday, built on the unpaid labor of dozens of illegal immigrants hired using sham Social Security numbers.\par \par \uc2 Federal authorities seized 14 7-Eleven stores on Long Island and in Virginia, arresting nine owners and managers, and seized property, including five homes. They are investigating 40 other 7-Eleven franchises in New York City and elsewhere in one of the largest criminal immigrant employment investigations ever conducted by the Justice and Homeland Security Departments, officials said.\par \par \uc2 Through the scheme, the defendants, who as franchisees for the parent company were licensed to use 7-Eleven buildings, trademarks and Slurpee and hot dog machines, recruited more than 50 illegal immigrants and gave them identities stolen from American citizens, including children and dead people.\par \par \uc2 The employees worked for 100 hours a week but were paid for a fraction of that time, and were forced to live in substandard housing owned by the operators of the convenience stores, the authorities said.\par \par \uc2 The store managers escaped notice, some for more than a decade, because the national company, \uc2 7-Eleven Inc\uc2 ., which has more than 7,600 stores in the United States, did not have safeguards in place to protect its payroll system from employee fraud, the authorities said. For example, two immigrant employees, one in New York and one in Virginia, used the same Social Security number to get paid.\par \par \uc2 There was ''little to no effort to insure the integrity of their payroll system,'' said Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, whose office helped investigate the case.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for \uc2 7-Eleven Inc\uc2 ., Scott Matter, said in a statement that the company would ''take aggressive actions to audit the employment status of all its franchisees' employees'' and was cooperating with federal authorities. The company, based in Dallas, is one of the largest operators of convenience stores in the world.\par \par \uc2 The raids come as Congress is debating a major overhaul of the immigration system, and Obama administration officials have been called upon to defend their record on enforcement against illegal immigration to convince skeptical lawmakers, many of them Republicans, that the nation is ready to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Under the Obama administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has moved away from high-profile workplace raids in which dozens of workers in the country illegally were rounded up for deportation. Instead, agents from ICE, as the agency is known, have relied on audits of employers' hiring records to detect \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers.\par \par \uc2 The audits were low profile but often very effective at forcing illegal immigrants to leave their jobs.\par \par \uc2 Federal immigration officials said the wage theft and other abuses of the workers in the 7-Eleven case were the type of violation they now treat as a priority. Vincent Picard, an ICE spokesman, said the timing of the arrests was not related to the debate in Washington.\par \par \uc2 The case began two years ago when a 7-Eleven employee approached the New York State Police about not being paid for his work. Another worker later contacted the Suffolk County police.\par \par \uc2 The investigation led to two families and their associates with roots in Pakistan and the Philippines, who recruited from their own ethnic communities.\par \par \uc2 Farrukh and Bushra Baig, a married couple and American citizens from Pakistan who live on Long Island, owned and managed 12 stores in New York and Virginia along with Mr. Baig's brothers, Zahid and Shannawaz, and his associates, Malik Yousaf, Tariq Rana and Ramon Nanas. All have been charged.\par \par \uc2 A separate case was brought against two brothers, Ahzar Zia, a citizen of the United States and Pakistan, and Ummar Uppal, who the authorities said was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . They own and control two stores in Suffolk County.\par \par \uc2 The defendants entered each employee's personal information and hours worked into computer terminals at the stores. The parent company processed the payroll and sent the wages to the employers for distribution. The defendants, officials said, never paid the workers all that they were due.\par \par \uc2 Instead, prosecutors said, they might have earned $300 to $500 per week for 100 hours of work.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lynch said the employees ''were not innocent victims in this scheme,'' but added that they had been abused.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have not found a connection between the two families, suggesting that the knowledge of how to exploit the payroll system could have been widespread and the ongoing investigation is based on payroll records provided by the parent company. Prosecutors are seeking $30 million in forfeiture from the stores and the corporate parent.\par \par \uc2 The charges were announced at a news conference by Ms. Lynch and James T. Hayes, who is in charge of ICE's office of investigations in New York City, along with officials from the New York State Police and the Suffolk County Police Department.\par \par \uc2 ''From their 7-Eleven stores the defendants dispensed wire fraud and identity theft, along with Slurpees and hot dogs,'' Ms. Lynch said. ''In bedroom communities across Long Island and Virginia, the defendants not only systematically employed illegal immigrants but concealed their crimes by raiding the cradle and grave to steal the identify of children and even the dead.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lynch said the defendants ''ruthlessly exploited their immigrant employees,'' forcing them to live in unregulated boardinghouses and ''creating a modern -day plantation system.''\par \par \uc2 In one instance, an employee of one franchise was paid using the Social Security number of a former 7-Eleven employee, a person who had not worked for the store for 10 years and who had been the target of collection efforts by the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  for much of that time because of the reported payments to the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , officials said.\par \par \uc2 The charges against the owners and managers, eight men and a woman, included wire fraud conspiracy and aggravated identity theft. Each pleaded not guilty in federal court and was held in custody pending trial.\par \par \uc2 The conduct charged in the indictment, officials said, had been going on since 2000, during which the defendants generated more than $180 million in revenue.\par \par \uc2 One of the raids took place around 6 a.m., at a 7-Eleven on Carleton Avenue in Islip Terrace, on Long Island, according to a law enforcement agent at the scene who declined to give his name or reveal the agency he worked for. One person, he said, was taken into custody from the store and two people were taken away from a house across the street.\par \par \uc2 A neighbor who lives near the house said the home had been divided into several apartments.\par \par \uc2 ''It's packed in there,'' said the neighbor, who asked not to be identified. ''There's been a constant flow of new people coming in.''\par \par \uc2 A 7-Eleven store on Carleton Avenue in Islip Terrace, N.Y., was  among 14 stores on Long Island and in Virginia raided Monday.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- As debate started on Wednesday on amendments to the Senate immigration bill, border security emerged as a focal point, with supporters and doubters agreeing that those provisions would have to be strengthened to attract more votes, especially from Republicans.\par \par \uc2 ''In order to bring conservatives to this cause, those who want immigration reform must understand that a real solution must ensure that our borders are secure,'' said Senator \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  of Kentucky, a Republican who is one of those conservatives.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Paul, a libertarian close to the Tea Party movement, said he supported the bill's purpose of creating a pathway to legal status for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers, but would not vote for it without tougher border provisions.\par \par \uc2 The eight senators who wrote the overhaul bill say they are open to changes, but not to altering its core: a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants now in the country illegally, with a sequence of border measures, known as triggers, along the way.\par \par \uc2 ''The bottom line for us is we need to make sure the pathway is real,'' said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a Democrat who is one of the eight, ''and that people can be assured that whatever trigger or gating items are in place are ones that don't make the pathway to citizenship a fantasy.'' Mr. Bennet spoke at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.\par \par \uc2 The debate got off to a rocky start with a dispute between Senator \uc2 Harry Reid\uc2  of Nevada, the majority leader, and several Republicans, including Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, over how many votes would be required to pass an amendment.\par \par \uc2 The current bill would give the Department of Homeland Security six months to present plans to extend border fencing and achieve ''effective control'' of the Southwest border, defined as continuous surveillance along its length and 90 percent effectiveness in stopping illegal crossings. Once those plans are presented, illegal immigrants could apply for provisional status. The bill includes $4.5 billion in border financing in the first five years.\par \par \uc2 If the security goals had not been met after five years, a commission would be created to ensure border officials met them. After 10 years, provisional immigrants could apply for permanent residency -- the first step toward citizenship -- if the border plans were fully operational, the fencing was completed, mandatory electronic verification for new workers was in place nationwide and an electronic exit system checked foreigners departing through airports and seaports.\par \par \uc2 An important test for the bill was an amendment filed Wednesday by Senator John Cornyn of Texas, whom other Republicans are watching closely. It would require certification from Homeland Security and the top federal auditor that his border goals had been met for one year before provisional immigrants could start the path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Democrats denounced Mr. Cornyn's amendment as a ''poison pill'' to cripple the bill. But Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican who is one of the eight authors, said at the breakfast with Mr. Bennet that he believed Mr. Cornyn was looking ''to improve the bill'' and that they were working to find a compromise.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grassley offered an amendment that would require Homeland Security certification of effective control of the entire Southwest border six months before any illegal immigrants could apply even for provisional status.\par \par \uc2 ''Border security first. Legalize second,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Paul said he would offer an amendment that would require Congress to vote to approve border security levels annually for five years while illegal immigrants gradually received work visas.\par \par \uc2 Senator Rand Paul said security must be tougher.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- A federal judge ruled on Friday that Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his deputies had violated the constitutional rights of Latinos by targeting them during raids and traffic stops here and throughout Maricopa County.\par \par \uc2 With his ruling, Judge G. Murray Snow of United States District Court delivered the most decisive defeat so far to Sheriff Arpaio, who has come to symbolize Arizona's strict approach to immigration enforcement by making it the leading mission for many of the 800 deputies under his command at the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.\par \par \uc2 At 142 pages, the decision is peppered with stinging criticism of the policies and practices espoused by Sheriff Arpaio, who Judge Snow said had turned much of his focus to arresting immigrants who were in the country illegally, in most cases civil violations, at the expense of fighting crimes.\par \par \uc2 He said the sheriff relied on racial profiling and illegal detentions to target Latinos, using their ethnicity as the main basis for suspecting they were in the country illegally. Many of the people targeted were American citizens or legal residents.\par \par \uc2 ''In an immigration enforcement context,'' Judge Snow ruled, the sheriff's office ''did not believe that it constituted racial profiling to consider race as one factor among others in making law enforcement decisions.'' In fact, he said its plans and policies confirmed that, ''in the context of immigration enforcement,'' deputies ''could consider race as one factor among others.''\par \par \uc2 The ruling prohibits the sheriff's office from using ''race or Latino ancestry'' as a factor in deciding to stop any vehicle with Latino occupants, or as a factor in deciding whether they may be in the country without authorization.\par \par \uc2 It also prohibits deputies from reporting a vehicle's Latino occupants to federal immigration authorities or detaining, holding or arresting them, unless there is more than just a ''reasonable belief'' that they are in the country illegally. To detain them, the ruling said, the deputies must also have reasonable suspicion that the occupants are violating the state's human-trafficking and employment laws or committing other crimes.\par \par \uc2 Tim Casey, a lawyer for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, said the office intended to appeal, but in the meantime it would ''comply with the letter and spirit of the court's decision.''\par \par \uc2 He said the office's position is that it ''has never used race and never will use race to make any law enforcement decision.''\par \par \uc2 The office relied on training from the \uc2 United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  agency, he said, adding, ''It's obvious it received bad training from the federal government.''\par \par \uc2 The ruling is a result of a federal civil trial last summer in which Sheriff Arpaio and his office were accused in a class-action lawsuit of singling out Latinos for stops, questioning and detention. It says deputies considered the prevalence of Latinos when deciding where to carry out enforcement operations, in many cases in response to complaints based solely on assumptions that Latinos or ''Mexicans,'' as some complainants put it, were necessarily illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of the type of enforcement -- workplace raids, traffic stops or targeted patrols in areas frequented by day laborers -- Sheriff Arpaio's deputies were required to keep track of the number of people arrested on federal immigration violations, as well as state charges, Judge Snow said. In news releases, Sheriff Arpaio's office often referred to the operations as integral parts of the sheriff's ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  stance.''\par \par \uc2 Cecillia Wang, director of the Immigrants' Rights Project at the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 , one of the groups that brought the lawsuit, said, ''Let this be a warning to anyone who hides behind a badge to wage their own private campaign against Latinos or immigrants that there is no exception in the Constitution for violating people's rights in immigration enforcement.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020130525e95p0005r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc5}{\*\bkmkend toc5}\b \uc2 Immigration Splits Senator From Mentor\b0\par\par\uc2 By ASHLEY PARKER; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.   \par \uc2 1,466 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 April 2013\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- \uc2 Jim DeMint\uc2  helped makeMarco Rubio a Senate star -- and he could be forgiven for regretting it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. DeMint, a former Republican senator from South Carolina, endorsed Mr. Rubio early on in his 2010 Senate bid, when he was still a long-shot Tea Party candidate, and Mr. Rubio has said that Mr. DeMint is his best friend, after his wife.\par \par \uc2 And yet, perhaps for the first time, the two men now find themselves at odds on a major issue. In 2007, Mr. DeMint was instrumental in helping to kill legislation to overhaul the nation's immigration system, and now, six years later, Mr. Rubio, Republican of Florida, is a pivotal member of a bipartisan Senate group that has written a bill that would do just what Mr. DeMint was fighting to prevent.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Rubio's immigration push meets vocal and persistent opposition, it will be Mr. DeMint, newly ensconced as the president of the Heritage Foundation, among those leading the charge. The foundation plans to issue an updated version of its 2007 economic study that helped doom the overhaul.\par \par \uc2 And Mr. DeMint has taken to the Internet, national newspapers and conservative talk radio to push against the legislation of his former prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9.\par \par \uc2 ''I certainly wish he was on my side,'' Mr. Rubio said. ''But he's a very principled man and he truly believes this is the wrong approach and I respect that.''\par \par \uc2 During his time in the Senate, Mr. DeMint, 61, earned a reputation as something of a smiling assassin -- a mild-mannered legislator with a soft Southern drawl who could be a near-constant irritant to those not in line with his conservative causes and principles. Now, he has begun gearing up for the next fight.\par \par \uc2 Before the legislation was even unveiled, at a session with bloggers, Mr. DeMint -- whose new nongovernment salary, if it mirrors his predecessor's, is likely to be more than $1 million -- warned that the bill was being ''developed behind closed doors, in secret.''\par \par \uc2 ''We've seen this movie before,'' he said. ''We know how this game plays out.''\par \par \uc2 Though Mr. DeMint says he supports legal immigration, he prefers a piecemeal approach to fixing the system and views any path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally as amnesty, forgiveness for breaking the law.\par \par \uc2 His main argument is an economic one -- a belief that unauthorized immigrants, who he said would ultimately take out more in federal benefits than they would pay in taxes, would be a drain on the economy. (Under the legislation proposed in the Senate, it would be at least 13 years before an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  would qualify for any federal benefits.)\par \par \uc2 In its 2007 study, \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2  estimated that an immigration overhaul could cost taxpayers roughly $2.5 trillion, and that staggering sum is credited with helping provide a rationale to kill the legislation. Though Republican politicians and other groups have since criticized the research as flawed, \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2  plans to release a new version of the study soon.\par \par \uc2 Mr. DeMint, who in the Senate was willing to oppose his fellow Republicans, has already proved himself formidable in his new role, as his organization helped the Republican opposition to a background check compromise on gun legislation that was ultimately defeated.\par \par \uc2 ''What \uc2 Jim DeMint\uc2  has done is a wonderful thing,'' said \uc2 Larry Pratt\uc2 , the executive director of Gun Owners of America. ''He has shown that the best way to make change in Washington is from the outside.''\par \par \uc2 And when it comes to immigration, his word, especially in conservative circles, is still highly influential.\par \par \uc2 ''We care what Senator DeMint's perspective on an issue is because we have a relationship with him, and he remains much more popular in my district than I am,'' said Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, referring to the state's delegation. ''I'd be crazy not to.''\par \par \uc2 Immigration watchers, meanwhile, are curious about how the relationship between Mr. DeMint and Mr. Rubio will affect the debate. ''He was an early backer of Rubio and Rubio owes him a lot,'' said Keith Appell, a Republican political consultant.\par \par \uc2 ''If DeMint wins, Rubio loses,'' said \uc2 Frank Sharry\uc2 , the executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration group. ''The Republicans' best chance going forward is to have \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  win this day, and if \uc2 Jim DeMint\uc2  cuts him off at the knees, he's going to hurt Republican chances of regaining the White House.''\par \par \uc2 Others see their relationship as that of a young, charismatic son (Mr. Rubio) eclipsing his more experienced father (Mr. DeMint).\par \par \uc2 ''It's almost like a Greek story, where the offspring is now leading the very thing his father made his bones over,'' said a Senate Republican aide, speaking anonymously in order to offer a candid assessment. ''The leader who killed the 2007 bill -- that was his one accomplishment. And now his prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9 is picking up the baton in the exact opposite direction.''\par \par \uc2 Because of a Senate ethics rule, Mr. DeMint is all but banned from discussing policy with Mr. Rubio for two years. But that hasn't stopped \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2  and its policy advocacy arm, Heritage Action, from doing all it can to influence the immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 The organization hosts various briefings and conversations, and is considered, in the words of Mr. Appell, ''one of the cornerstones of intellectual force in the conservative movement.'' Mr. DeMint himself has written an op-ed article in which he derided the bill as ''legislated amnesty'' that would harm American taxpayers. He has also penned blog posts and appeared on talk radio.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rubio and his office are keeping a close eye on where Mr. DeMint and \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2  stand.\par \par \uc2 Though loath to take on Mr. DeMint himself, Mr. Rubio and his staff are already pushing back on his economic argument, saying that the public benefits of an immigration overhaul would outweigh any concerns about cost. Mr. Rubio said that most immigrants, ''once they become legalized and improve their lives, they'll be better. In essence, they'll pay more in taxes because they'll be making more.''\par \par \uc2 ''So basically, if you're going to come to this country, you're going to wait 13 years to even have a chance to apply for citizenship,'' he added, ''have no federal benefits in the meantime, have to pay taxes, a fine, undergo background checks twice, all those sorts of things, in exchange for being able to take advantage of welfare programs 13 years from now, 14 years from now?'' The answer, he implied, was no.\par \par \uc2 Friends of Mr. DeMint said that contrary to his public image, he rarely wages personal attacks and can disagree while still being cordial.\par \par \uc2 ''The way he usually ends his conversations with me is, 'Reasonable minds can differ' or 'You need to do what you think is best,' '' Mr. Gowdy said. ''I imagine he ends his conversations with Senator Rubio precisely the same way.''\par \par \uc2 But the 2007 immigration debate quickly became heated, and at times nasty. Legislators yelled at one another on the Senate floor. At one point, a Drudge Report link to a news release from Mr. DeMint's office, calling the bill ''amnesty,'' crashed the Congressional servers because it was so widely read.\par \par \uc2 For now, however, both Mr. DeMint and Mr. Rubio said they did not expect their differing approaches on immigration to strain their friendship.\par \par \uc2 ''Good friends can have honest disagreements, but I know we're working towards the same goal -- a lawful immigration system that works for America -- with differing solutions of how we get there,'' said Mr. DeMint, in response to questions over e-mail.\par \par \uc2 And, from Mr. Rubio: ''We have some disagreements on the best way forward on immigration. But it's never going to change how I feel about \uc2 Jim DeMint\uc2 , and hopefully it doesn't change how he feels about me.''\par \par \uc2 He paused, then added a bit more confidently: ''I know it doesn't.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: May 2, 2013, Thursday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A subheading on Tuesday with the continuation of an article about the disagreement over immigration between \uc2 Jim DeMint\uc2 , a former Republican senator, and his onetime prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9 \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  misstated, in some editions, the year Mr. DeMint endorsed Mr. Rubio in his 2010 Senate bid. It was 2009, not 2007.\par \par \uc2 Jim DeMint in Washington on Dec. 6, the day he said he would leave the Senate and join the Heritage Foundation.

\par\par \uc2 Media; SECT\par {\*\bkmkstart toc6}{\*\bkmkend toc6}\b \uc2 The Times Shifts on '\uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2 ,' but Doesn't Ban the Use\b0\par\par\uc2 By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY   \par \uc2 981 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 April 2013\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As the debate over a new immigration bill preoccupies Washington, a quieter debate over the use of the term ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' has stirred up the country's newsrooms.\par \par \uc2 This month, The Associated Press announced it would eliminate the use of ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' entirely. The news agency wrote, ''Except in direct quotes essential to the story, use 'illegal' only to refer to an action, not a person: illegal immigration, but not \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  updated its policies on how it uses the phrase ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' in its coverage. The newspaper did not go as far as The Associated Press, and it will continue to allow the phrase to be used for ''someone who enters, lives in or works in the United States without proper legal authorization.'' But it encourages reporters and editors to ''consider alternatives when appropriate to explain the specific circumstances of the person in question, or to focus on actions.''\par \par \uc2 Philip B. Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, who oversees The Times's style manual, made the announcement on Tuesday shortly after a group staged a protest in front of The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  headquarters and delivered more than 70,000 signatures to \uc2 Jill Abramson\uc2 , the executive editor of The Times, asking her to end the use of the phrase.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Corbett said in a statement that editors had spent months deliberating the updated style change. He said he shared these changes ''with key reporters and editors over the last couple of weeks.'' He said he recognized how sensitive this issue is for readers.\par \par \uc2 This nuanced approach to the term ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' was far from what the protesters who appeared outside of the Eighth Avenue entrance to The Times building had sought. Four protesters held signs that read ''No Human Being is 'Illegal' Drop the I-Word.''\par \par \uc2 Fernando Chavez, son of the Mexican-American activist Cesar Chavez, flew in from Northern California for the protest to represent the views of his mother, Helen Fabela Chavez.\par \par \uc2 He said the widespread use of ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' represented one of the few times his mother had ''displayed an opinion'' about an issue. ''It dehumanizes the individual and it's counterproductive,'' he said of the phrase.\par \par \uc2 Among the protesters was Jose Antonio Vargas, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who emphasized that he wanted Tuesday's protest to remain civil. He revealed that he was living undocumented in the United States in an article that ran in The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  in June 2011 after his former employer, The Washington Post, decided not to run the story. Since then, he has spoken publicly about being undocumented. He is producing a documentary on the topic.\par \par \uc2 ''I have a lot of respect for The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 ,'' Mr. Vargas said. ''The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  published my essay after that Washington Post rejected it.'' But he said he felt that The Times needed to make some changes. ''The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  needs to get with the times.''\par \par \uc2 Last fall, when Mr. Vargas spoke at a San Francisco conference held by the Online News Association, he started to challenge the use of the term \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in the news media. Shortly afterward, he also exchanged e-mails with Margaret Sullivan, The Times's public editor, about the phrase. She wrote in an Oct. 2, 2012 article, ''I see no advantage for Times readers in a move away from the paper's use of the phrase '\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .' ''\par \par \uc2 Since then, discussions have circulated throughout the news media about the use of the phrase. Julia Preston, The Times's immigration reporter, said in a blog post written by Ms. Sullivan in September that the paper needed ''a little more flexibility.'' But she said ''we should use the term at times -- it is accurate.''\par \par \uc2 The changes announced by Mr. Corbett to the stylebook suggested caution when looking for alternatives to ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 " 'Unauthorized' is also an acceptable description, though it has a bureaucratic tone,'' Mr. Corbett said. " 'Undocumented' is the term preferred by many immigrants and their advocates, but it has a flavor of euphemism and should be approached with caution outside quotations.'' The stylebook also calls for special care to be taken with those who have a complicated or shifting status, like those brought to the United States as children.\par \par \uc2 ''Advocates on one side of this political debate have called on news organizations to use only the terms they prefer,'' Mr. Corbett said. ''But we have to make those decisions for journalistic reasons alone, based on what we think best informs our readers on this important topic.'' He added: ''It's not our job to take sides.''\par \par \uc2 Some of the protesters outside The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  represented people with complicated immigration statuses themselves. Mikhel A. Crichlow, the 27-year-old co-chairman of the International Youth Association, said he appeared on Tuesday because he was undocumented and could not work in the field he trained in, which is architecture. Mr. Crichlow said he moved to New York City 12 years ago when the city's Department of Education recruited his mother from Trinidad and Tobago to work as a schoolteacher. While Mr. Crichlow's mother is in the country legally and about to qualify for her green card, Mr. Crichlow has become too old to remain here legally.\par \par \uc2 ''The 'illegal' word conjures up the wrong associations for people,'' Mr. Crichlow said. ''I'm not authorized to work because of my status.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Vargas said he had mixed emotions about The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's updated policy.\par \par \uc2 ''The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  can't have it both ways,'' he said. ''But at the end of the day, the bottom line is I am for reporters, including reporters at The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , to be as descriptive and contextual as possible.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020130424e94o0007d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- It was, Senator \uc2 Harry Reid\uc2  of Nevada ebulliently proclaimed, a ''happy day for me'' as he stood with Wayne LaPierre, the head of the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 , in 2010 at a new shooting range in Las Vegas made possible by federal money secured by Mr. Reid. ''People who criticize this probably would criticize baseball,'' Mr. Reid said before firing off a few rounds.\par \par \uc2 These days, Mr. Reid, the Senate majority leader, is far more likely to meet with Mayor \uc2 Michael R. Bloomberg\uc2  of New York, an outspoken advocate of stricter gun control, than with Mr. LaPierre as he prepares to bring the most expansive package of gun safety legislation in a decade to the Senate floor over the next few weeks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reid's evolution from a proponent of gun rights to the shepherd of legislation that would expand background checks, among other gun control measures, emerges from a complex web of political calculations that have come to define his leadership style over the last decade.\par \par \uc2 How tenacious Mr. Reid is willing to be -- and whether he will extract votes one by one as he has for other big pieces of legislation -- may well determine the fate of the measures.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reid declined to be interviewed but answered questions by e-mail. ''The families of Newtown and Aurora and the victims of gun violence everywhere deserve a vote on these issues,'' Mr. Reid wrote. ''We owe them a vote, and I will make sure they get a vote.'' He added, ''Only those who are afraid of a free and open debate would try to block it or shut it down.''\par \par \uc2 With guns, as with gay rights and immigration, Washington has observed in Mr. Reid an evolution -- less flip-flops than slow dances to the left -- that reflects shifting attitudes not only in his Democratic conference but also in Nevada, where Democrats have gained an edge in the last decade. Voter registration in the state has become increasingly Democratic as its population has swelled, and Barack Obama won the state twice, the only Democrat besides \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  to win the state in the last 40 years.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Harry Reid\uc2  is the most calculating individual I have ever covered in politics,'' said \uc2 Jon Ralston\uc2 , editor of Ralston Reports, who has covered Nevada politics for three decades. ''If he is making the right move for his members, he is making the right move for himself.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reid voted proudly against an assault weapons ban in both 1993 and 2004, even as most Senate Democrats voted for it, and voted for a successful 2005 measure that limited lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers for negligence. He has also long supported the N.R.A.\par \par \uc2 But now, in a demonstration of his loyalty to President Obama, Mr. Reid is helping him pursue his agenda for stemming gun violence. Many of the more senior members of his caucus, notably Senator \uc2 Dianne Feinstein\uc2  of California, also want these votes.\par \par \uc2 ''He is doing what a leader needs to do,'' said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, one of Mr. Reid's prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9es in the Senate, ''to move the caucus forward so it stays in tune with where the American people are.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reid, aides said, is also motivated by both the personal angst he felt over the killing of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., last year, as well as the anger he feels toward the N.R.A., which was widely expected to endorse him in his 2010 re-election campaign but then declined to do so.\par \par \uc2 After the Senate returns from its recess next week, it will consider a bill that would expand background checks and increase penalties for so-called straw purchases, in which someone buys a gun for another person who is unable to buy one. Mr. Reid opted not to include in the bill a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines but plans to hold a separate vote on both measures. His hope was to not let the less popular measures jeopardize passage of the expanded background checks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reid is almost certain to vote in favor of at least some of the new gun safety measures, if not all of them.\par \par \uc2 It would not be the first time Mr. Reid had shifted his position on a significant public policy issue. For example, in 1993, Mr. Reid co-sponsored legislation that would have stripped the citizen rights from babies born to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  mothers, and vigorously denounced immigrants from the floor. The bill did not make it out of the Judiciary Committee.\par \par \uc2 Just over a decade later, Mr. Reid apologized for the legislation, which he called ''the low point of my governmental career,'' and became a proponent of the Dream Act, which would give a pathway to citizenship to some children of illegal immigrants. Immigration reform was a centerpiece of his 2010 re-election campaign, against the advice of many of his political strategists.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, Mr. Reid voted for a 1993 measure that institutionalized the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy for gay members of the military. But by 2009 he had became an opponent of the policy. That year, Mr. Reid, asked to support a moratorium on the practice, said he would go further and press for its repeal, an offhand statement that ignited the repeal efforts in his chamber.\par \par \uc2 During the 2010 lame-duck session, Mr. Reid repeatedly and vociferously pressed for the repeal, including making an emotional floor speech in which he said: ''Discrimination has never served America well. When it applies to those who serve America in the armed forces, it is both disgraceful and counterproductive.''\par \par \uc2 When a move to repeal the policy failed on a procedural vote, Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, went back to Mr. Reid and begged for a second vote, which he delivered, and the measure passed, with bipartisan support.\par \par \uc2 Like many Democrats -- and a few Republicans -- Mr. Reid has also re-evaluated his views on same-sex marriage. For years, Mr. Reid repeatedly said that ''marriage is between a man and a woman,'' and he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, which denied federal marital benefits to gay couples. Only recently has Mr. Reid starting saying that gay and lesbian couples have the right to marry; he co-signed the amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to find the law unconstitutional. Gay marriage was banned in Nevada by initiative a decade ago and there is now a bill to repeal the ban before the State Legislature.\par \par \uc2 ''He deserves a lot of credit for having the guts to stick his neck out,'' Mr. Bloomberg, an independent, wrote in an e-mail, ''especially on guns and immigration when others are worried about special-interest politics.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reid's biggest struggle is to balance the needs of vulnerable Democrats who are up for re-election -- especially moderate, long-serving members who are largely institutionalists -- with the agendas of newcomers who lean farther to the left.\par \par \uc2 Since 2006, as larger-than-life Democrats like Senators \uc2 Robert C. Byrd\uc2 , Edward M. Kennedy and Daniel K. Inouye have died, Democrats have had a big influx of members pressing Mr. Reid toward a more aggressive and often liberal stance.\par \par \uc2 ''My role is to listen to every single member of the caucus and understand where they are coming from,'' Mr. Reid said by e-mail. ''Everyone won't be 100 percent happy all the time, but I try to make sure that all voices have input on the decision-making process, and understand the steps we are taking.''\par \par \uc2 This conflict came to the fore during discussions of changing the filibuster rules; Mr. Reid ultimately chose an approach that placed fewer limitations on a minority party's ability to filibuster than the newer members wanted.\par \par \uc2 ''The Democratic caucus is a progressive caucus,'' said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. ''I think he leads us mostly the way we want to go. I think we all learned lessons on the filibuster.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reid remains an enigma of sorts in Washington, a quiet force whose voice is often barely audible, who skips Sunday talk shows in favor of church and lunch with his wife and remains, by all accounts, gaga for her after decades of marriage.\par \par \uc2 He is a man who relies on his members to do the routine prep work on bills until the time comes to marshal votes. He also prefers brief conversations to lengthy ones. ''There isn't one senator who doesn't know when you talk to \uc2 Harry Reid\uc2  on the phone you better say what you have to say fast,'' Ms. Murray said. ''Many senators have found themselves talking after he has already hung up.''\par \par \uc2 Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, holding a news conference  last month after meeting with President Obama.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TAYLORSVILLE, N.C. -- Sheri Farley walks with a limp. The only job she could hold would be one where she does not have to stand or sit longer than 20 minutes, otherwise pain screams down her spine and up her legs.\par \par \uc2 ''Damaged goods,'' Ms. Farley describes herself, recalling how she recently overheard a child whispering to her mother about whether the ''crippled lady'' was a meth addict.\par \par \uc2 For about five years, Ms. Farley, 45, stood alongside about a dozen other workers, spray gun in hand, gluing together foam cushions for chairs and couches sold under brand names like Broyhill, Ralph Lauren and Thomasville. Fumes from the glue formed a yellowish fog inside the plant, and Ms. Farley's doctors say that breathing them in eventually ate away at her nerve endings, resulting in what she and her co-workers call ''dead foot.''\par \par \uc2 A chemical she handled -- known as n-propyl bromide, or nPB -- is also used by tens of thousands of workers in auto body shops, dry cleaners and high-tech electronics manufacturing plants across the nation. Medical researchers, government officials and even chemical companies that once manufactured nPB have warned for over a decade that it causes neurological damage and infertility when inhaled at low levels over long periods, but its use has grown 15-fold in the past six years.\par \par \uc2 Such hazards demonstrate the difficulty, despite decades of effort, of ensuring that Americans can breathe clean air on the job. Even as worker after worker fell ill, records from the \uc2 Occupational Safety and Health Administration\uc2  show that managers at Royale Comfort Seating, where Ms. Farley was employed, repeatedly exposed gluers to nPB levels that exceeded levels federal officials considered safe, failed to provide respirators and turned off fans meant to vent fumes.\par \par \uc2 But the story of the rise of nPB and the decline of Ms. Farley's health is much more than the tale of one company, or another chapter in the national debate over the need for more, or fewer, government regulations. Instead, it is a parable about the law of unintended consequences.\par \par \uc2 It shows how an \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  program meant to prevent the use of harmful chemicals fostered the proliferation of one, and how a hard-fought victory by OSHA in controlling one source of deadly fumes led workers to be exposed to something worse -- a phenomenon familiar enough to be lamented in government parlance as ''regrettable substitution.''\par \par \uc2 It demonstrates how businesses at once both suffer from and exploit the fitful and disjointed way that the government tries to protect workers, and why occupational illnesses have proved so hard to prevent.\par \par \uc2 And it highlights a startling fact: OSHA, the watchdog agency that many Americans love to hate and industry often faults as overzealous, has largely ignored long-term threats. Partly out of pragmatism, the agency created by President Richard M. Nixon to give greater attention to health issues has largely done the opposite.\par \par \uc2 OSHA devotes most of its budget and attention to responding to here-and-now dangers rather than preventing the silent, slow killers that, in the end, take far more lives. Over the past four decades, the agency has written new standards with exposure limits for 16 of the most deadly workplace hazards, including lead, asbestos and arsenic. But for the tens of thousands of other dangerous substances American workers handle each day, employers are largely left to decide what exposure level is safe.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, OSHA has two dozen pages of regulations just on ladders and stairs.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm the first to admit this is broken,'' said \uc2 David Michaels\uc2 , the OSHA director, referring to the agency's record on dealing with workplace health threats. ''Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people end up on the gurney.''\par \par \uc2 Royale Comfort Seating disputes that Ms. Farley's health problems and those of some other workers were linked to their jobs. Company officials also say that while they have sought to safeguard their workers, they have also feared losing jobs to foreign competitors, as many of their industry counterparts in North Carolina have.\par \par \uc2 Royale has not switched away from the nPB glues, managers said, because alternatives did not work well, were sometimes more dangerous and were almost always more expensive.\par \par \uc2 ''We, as a company, are also in a tight spot,'' said William Lee Isenhour, Royale's director of personnel and safety.\par \par \uc2 Chronic ailments caused by toxic workplace air -- black lung, stonecutter's disease, asbestosis, grinder's rot, pneumoconiosis -- incapacitate more than 200,000 workers in the United States annually. More than 40,000 Americans die prematurely each year from exposure to toxic substances at work -- 10 times as many as those who die from the refinery explosions, mine collapses and other accidents that grab most of the news media attention.\par \par \uc2 Occupational illnesses and injuries like Ms. Farley's cost the American economy roughly $250 billion per year because of medical expenses and lost productivity, according to government data analyzed by J. Paul Leigh, an economist at the University of California, Davis, more than the cost of diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Roughly 40 percent of medical expenses from workplace hazards, or about $27 billion a year, is paid by public programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\par \par \uc2 And yet the full price of this epidemic is measured not just in hospital bills and wages lost, but also in the ways, large and small, that life has changed for Ms. Farley and other sickened workers. Glue fumes robbed her of dignity and the joy of small comforts. Her favorite high heels stay in her closet because her feet no longer cooperate. She barks at her 8-year-old daughter, Allie, for hopping around their double-wide trailer because the floor's vibrations cause intense stinging.\par \par \uc2 ''I did the work,'' Ms. Farley said about her years putting together furniture for America's households. ''This doesn't seem a fair price to pay.''\par \par \uc2 Foam Country\par \par \uc2 Two industries converge in North Carolina along the nine-mile stretch of Interstate 40 between Hickory and Claremont. Foam meets furniture here. Cushions find seats.\par \par \uc2 For nearly a century, towns in these western foothills have been famous for their fine home furnishings, producing roughly half the chairs and tables sold nationwide at the industry's peak in the 1980s. Every year, several million pounds of a flexible polyurethane foam known as slabstock arrives. It becomes the spongy filling in most of the mattresses, chairs and couches produced in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Delivered as huge yellow or pink loaves, often about four feet high and the length of a tractor-trailer, the slabstock is cut into pieces and glued into shapes by rows of workers standing in booths. They sometimes attach upholstery or add a top layer of polyester fiber to give the cushions a softer feel.\par \par \uc2 North Carolina has been especially affected by globalization and federal regulations. Shifting cultural mores and rising cigarette taxes have cleared hundreds of tobacco farms. Foreign competition has closed most of the textile mills. More than half of the furniture jobs once based here are now gone, according to federal labor data.\par \par \uc2 Still, about a thousand people spread across several dozen plants in the state work in this locally vital industry. For Ms. Farley, the job at Royale making cushions represented something rare: a chance for someone with little more than a high school diploma and an ability to stand on her feet all day to make more than $9 an hour.\par \par \uc2 Day 1 at the job brought ominous advice. Don't dally, co-workers counseled her; managers keep track of your cushions per hour. Bring a hair dryer; it helps in warming brittle hands in winter when the plant gets frigid. Stock up on aspirin and tissues: the first to survive the headaches from the glue's gasoline-like fumes; the second because the fumes clear the sinuses.\par \par \uc2 Asked about the conditions, Royale officials said their three plants, two here in Taylorsville and one about 15 miles away in Conover, were no worse than others in the business.\par \par \uc2 But no one denied it was dirty, bone-tiring work. During 10-hour shifts, the gluers held spray guns attached to hoses that ran to a humming compressor and 55-gallon drums filled with the glue. Once sprayed, the glue coated everything -- the lights, fans, floors and electrical outlets -- and hung over the workers' cubicles like a shroud.\par \par \uc2 ''It puts the fog in your head,'' Ms. Farley said. By the end of a shift, the glue left some workers so dizzy that they walked as if they were drunk. At times, they did not remember driving home.\par \par \uc2 A Chemical's Use Grows\par \par \uc2 Cushion-making companies had every reason to like nPB glues. First marketed in the late 1990s, they were inexpensive, strong, fast-drying and, best of all, unregulated.\par \par \uc2 ''It's so safe you can eat it,'' glue salesmen in North Carolina told customers, according to federal researchers. Plant operators joked, ''At worst, it's a cheap high,'' an official from an industry trade association recalled. Water-based glues, though safer, dried slower. And retooling a plant to use them could cost anywhere from several thousand dollars to more than $1 million, in some cases doubling a company's gluing costs.\par \par \uc2 Finding a glue that complied with federal rules was a continuing struggle. In the early 1980s, many companies used glue with a chemical called 1,1,1-trichloroethane, or TCA. But the United States and other countries then banned it because it damages the ozone layer, and businesses switched to methylene chloride.\par \par \uc2 Nicknamed by cushion makers ''methyl ethyl bad stuff,'' it killed more than 30 workers a year and sickened thousands more across all industries. OSHA tightened safety limits on the chemical, so companies sought a new option. Before long, roughly a third of the cushion-making industry had switched to nPB-based glues.\par \par \uc2 For the most part, American employers are left on their own to find substitutes when federal agencies impose new rules on chemicals. But when the government forces the phasing out of one hazardous chemical, it is often replaced by another equally or more dangerous one.\par \par \uc2 From the start, government officials worried about the safety of nPB, which is also sometimes called 1-bromopropane or 1-BP.\par \par \uc2 In 1999, Adam Finkel, OSHA's top health officer who had led the agency's drive to phase out methylene chloride, wrote a letter warning that nPB was being used as a replacement at levels 10 to 200 times what chemical companies said was safe. Something needed to be done, he said, before the number of people exposed to the new chemical ''grows from the hundreds to the tens of thousands or more.''\par \par \uc2 Some companies pulled back. Protonique SA, a Swiss circuit-board maker, banned it for its workers, who used a form of the chemical that was less toxic than that inhaled by Royale workers. ''There is a weight of evidence that should sound warning bells to any thinking person,'' the company said in 1999. By 2003, Atofina and Great Lakes, two large chemical companies, had decided they would no longer sell nPB.\par \par \uc2 In the six years after Mr. Finkel wrote his warning letter, federal authorities learned that more than 140 cushion workers nationwide, mostly from plants in Utah, Mississippi and North Carolina, including Royale, had been exposed to dangerous levels of the chemical, many of them sickened and unable to walk.\par \par \uc2 Cushion makers in the 30,000-employee foam industry were among the most vulnerable of all workers using nPB because they breathed it in aerosol doses. Those employed in other businesses mostly used it in other forms, which pose lower risks, according to scientists, who are finding mounting evidence that nPB is also a carcinogen.\par \par \uc2 Pinpointing the cause of a worker's ailment is an inexact science because it is so difficult to rule out the role played by personal habits, toxins in the environment or other factors. But for nearly two decades, most chemical safety scientists have concluded that nPB can cause severe nerve damage when inhaled even at low levels.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Farley sued Royale for workers' compensation payments. Her case, along with several other lawsuits related to glue fumes brought by other workers, has been settled.\par \par \uc2 When news of exposure problems at Royale reached officials at Mid South Adhesives, the maker of the glue that Royale used, they sent an inspector who found that Royale's Conover plant showed levels at least 10 times what Mid South deemed safe. Mid South officials wrote to Royale to say they could ''not stress enough'' the need to provide better protections or to stop using their glue.\par \par \uc2 Royale officials, though, responded that even though they had added fans, had trained workers handling toxic chemicals and planned to put in a new ventilation system, problems persisted.\par \par \uc2 ''We tried to use a water-base adhesive, which did not work for us,'' a Royale official wrote, adding that the company saw no alternative but to stick with nPB glue.\par \par \uc2 Other companies were also reluctant to switch from nPB glues. Officials of the \uc2 Franklin Corporation\uc2 , a cushion plant in Houston, Miss., explained in court documents that safety was important but that nPB glues were attractive because they dried so fast that the cushions could be produced in a third of the time.\par \par \uc2 ''There are people lined up out there for jobs,'' said \uc2 John Lyles\uc2 , a vice president at Franklin, according to testimony by a plant manager in a successful lawsuit in Mississippi brought by four cushion workers who suffered severe nerve damage from the glue. ''If they start dropping like flies, or something in that order, we can replace them today.''\par \par \uc2 Businesses found nPB appealing partly because the E.P.A. had given it an endorsement of sorts by adding it to a list of chemicals that do not harm the ozone layer. But an unintended effect of that action was to allow sellers of the chemical to market it as federally approved, ''nonhazardous,'' green and worker-friendly.\par \par \uc2 As the chemical's popularity grew, E.P.A. officials worried about its use in spray glues, especially in cushion-making factories where the agency had determined that even with ''state of the art'' ventilation, ''nPB-based adhesives cannot be reliably used in a manner that protects human health.''\par \par \uc2 Environmental officials figured that OSHA, pressured by the Bush administration and Republican lawmakers to be more business-friendly, would not be capable of policing the growing threat. ''OSHA is tough,'' E.P.A. officials said, according to notes from a November 2006 meeting on concerns about nPB. ''But their budget is small, and they are not going to crack down on small businesses.''\par \par \uc2 OSHA has never set a standard establishing safety limits on workers' exposure to nPB. The E.P.A. recommended such a limit and considered banning the nPB glues, but it has yet to finalize the plan. It determined that most cushion companies using the glue had fewer than 100 employees, which meant they were less able to absorb the cost of another regulation.\par \par \uc2 ''There just wasn't the political will,'' an E.P.A. official who was part of the decision-making said on the condition of anonymity.\par \par \uc2 Improvised Remedies\par \par \uc2 A single tattered page from a 2005 workers' compensation log summed up the emerging situation at Royale. Beneath a column headed ''Injury or Illness'' stretched a dozen rows, each reading ''Alleged Neurological Injury'' -- one for each worker in the Conover plant sickened in the first three months of the year. Each missed more than 40 days of work because of the glue fumes, which were especially intense after the company moved the work stations closer together.\par \par \uc2 Thousands of additional pages of court and government documents, as well as interviews with more than two dozen current and former employees -- some speaking on the condition of anonymity -- present a fuller view of the conditions in the plant and how things got that way.\par \par \uc2 By 2005, Efrain Robles Avila was using a walker because he could no longer stand on his own, according to medical records. Victor Gonzales, a father of three, needed help putting on his clothes because he had lost control of his hands. Laura Garcia, who had worked for Royale for less than a year, complained of a cold numbness running from her waist to her toes. ''It was like your legs didn't receive the signal when you had to walk,'' she said in court documents.\par \par \uc2 The numbness was dangerous. One worker recounted meeting a neighbor who asked why she was wearing a single red shoe. Only then did the worker realize her foot was bleeding profusely from a two-inch gash.\par \par \uc2 Inside the plant, workers improvised. Some stood on scrap pieces of foam to cushion their feet and ease the stinging sensation creeping up their legs. One, Sonia Richards, arrived with her own respirator, but a manager told her to put it away, saying it was spooking other workers. In whispers, new employees were warned to visit the bathroom whenever the fog grew thick.\par \par \uc2 ''If you don't clear your head,'' a worker recalled being told, ''it will clear you.''\par \par \uc2 Royale is among the industry's most dangerous businesses, according to OSHA data. Federal officials found that it had exposed workers to dangerous levels of nPB at least a dozen times, more often than any other company. Since 2002, nearly three dozen Royale workers have been found to be breathing dangerous levels of glue fumes, federal records show.\par \par \uc2 Current and former employees say the number of workers sickened is most likely double that, since OSHA visited only periodically and turnover was high.\par \par \uc2 Some buyers of Royale cushions said they knew generally of the dangers of nPB, but expected their suppliers to take all required precautions. Lisa Hanly, vice president of Furniture Brands, which handles Broyhill and other well-known furniture, said, ''Our goal is to produce high-quality product, which meets all legal and safety requirements, at an affordable price.'' She said the company's inspections focused on suppliers overseas, where regulations are weaker than in the United States. Other companies that buy from Royale declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Royale workers became regular visitors at local health clinics, including the Clinic for People Without Health Insurance, then run by Dr. Ben Wofford.\par \par \uc2 Looking like ''upright cadavers,'' Dr. Wofford said, cushion workers arrived unable to stand on their own, supported under their arms by family members. They had showered and changed out of their work clothes, he said, but their breath still carried an odor he remembered from his boyhood days putting together model airplanes.\par \par \uc2 He had watched for years as his patients' suffering worsened with the bottoming out of the state's tobacco, textile and furniture industries. When people are out of work, he explained in an interview in his office above the pharmacy in Newton, N.C., a diabetic ulcer that would normally cost a toe takes a leg. Their nonfatal hernia bleeds them to death.\par \par \uc2 ''You kill jobs,'' Dr. Wofford said, ''you kill patients.''\par \par \uc2 Reluctantly, he wrote a letter in 2005 alerting OSHA about problems at Royale. One worker was in especially bad shape, he wrote: ''Indeed he may die as a result of his exposure.''\par \par \uc2 But Dr. Wofford also urged OSHA not to overreact. ''I would hate to see this plant's multiple shortcomings result in its being shut down,'' he wrote, warning of jobs that could be lost. ''Many are my patients and are already in dire straits economically.''\par \par \uc2 Referring to one woman who was the sole support for herself and three children, he wrote, ''She too is unlikely to find work if the effects of the neurotoxin are irreversible, as my neurological consultant thinks they may be.''\par \par \uc2 Over the years, officials with Royale, which employs about 100 workers and had around $7.5 million in sales in 2011, have repeatedly said they have done all they can to make their three plants safe. They frequently took steps to improve the air in their plants, but their actions were also sometimes counterproductive -- after improving ventilation, they failed to change filters, for example, or covered vents with plastic in the winter to keep out cold air, according to OSHA documents.\par \par \uc2 In a recent interview, Mr. Isenhour, Royale's safety director, said the company never meant to harm anyone and initially did not realize the hazards of nPB. Royale has continued using nPB glues, he added, because alternatives are ineffective or risky.\par \par \uc2 Glues that use acetone, for example, are popular but highly flammable, he said. Converting the Royale plant to meet federal rules on fire safety would entail replacing the glue-spraying booths with metal walls, installing sprinklers and explosion-proof lighting and retraining workers, at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars, he added.\par \par \uc2 In 2005, when seven workers became seriously ill at one plant, Mr. Isenhour said, Royale had to lay off 40 people, close the facility and spend $50,000 to move operations to another site and upgrade the ventilation there. OSHA found high levels of fumes in subsequent years because no one informed the company that fans and filters needed cleaning for ventilation to work properly, he said.\par \par \uc2 If the company switched to a more expensive glue, he said, he would have to raise the price of each cushion, and the furniture makers Royale supplies would contract with Chinese competitors instead.\par \par \uc2 ''We are trying to keep jobs in America,'' he said. ''But that's expensive.''\par \par \uc2 Both government officials and employers weigh the costs and benefits of protective measures. Many studies show that investing in workplace safety saves money in the long run, but economists say that does not prove true in every case. This, of course, raises the most difficult calculus of all: comparing the worth of a dangerous job versus no job at all. How should companies and regulators put a dollar value on workers' quality of life -- indeed, on their very lives?\par \par \uc2 To date, Royale has paid nearly a half-million dollars -- in court settlements, required upgrades and less than $20,000 in OSHA fines related to glue fumes. Those costs -- and the harm to workers -- accumulated in slow motion. Cushion making is a boom-bust business, subject to the swings of big orders from furniture companies. Royale and others in the industry frequently use transient, nonunion and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  laborers, according to workers and court documents, who are less likely to report hazards and document symptoms.\par \par \uc2 As fast as workers were getting sick, managers found replacements.\par \par \uc2 ''Folks was limping in and getting worse,'' said Dewaun Teague, a former Royale manager. ''Then they would be let go, and we would hire more.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Teague said Royale was a good company to work for in many ways. The owner, Clyde Goble, looked you in the eye when he shook your hand and remembered your children's birthdays, Mr. Teague said, adding, ''This was family.''\par \par \uc2 Complain. Inspect. Repeat.\par \par \uc2 After receiving an anonymous complaint about glue fumes, Beverly Stone, an OSHA inspector, visited a Royale foam cushion plant in Taylorsville in May 2011. She toured the facility, tested the air and then filed a lengthy report.\par \par \uc2 ''Ventilation did not appear to be working properly,'' it said, adding that at least 16 workers were breathing dangerous levels of glue fumes.\par \par \uc2 Worrisome enough on their own, Ms. Stone's findings were even more alarming because they were so similar to what OSHA documented in 1996, 2000, 2002 and 2005.\par \par \uc2 Again and again, Royale workers got sick and contacted OSHA. Inspectors came and went. Little changed.\par \par \uc2 Company officials were told to ventilate to the outside. They bought pedestal fans instead, and when OSHA inspectors returned, they found the fans turned off or malfunctioning. OSHA demanded respirators that would have cost the company $18. Managers instead handed out 90-cent dust masks -- the type inspectors had told them were useless in blocking vapors.\par \par \uc2 The agency advised the company to stop using nPB-based glues. And yet, each time inspectors showed up, they found more workers exposed to the chemical and at levels higher than what the glue companies were saying was safe.\par \par \uc2 Back and forth it went, as workers fell victim not just to toxic air but also to a federal agency's inability to enforce its requirements.\par \par \uc2 While agency inspectors consistently showed up within a day of receiving worker complaints, records show, they often did with one hand what they undid with the other. Sometimes they failed to levy fines because they did not believe they had the authority. Other times they undermined their own leverage by slashing the size of penalties in hopes of promoting cooperation from the company.\par \par \uc2 After each visit, the agency suggested abatements but never did follow-up air tests and appeared again only when sick workers complained.\par \par \uc2 For its part, the company shuffled workers among its three plants in the frustrated hope that one of the sites might have better air flow. But the constant movement of these workers from plant to plant also made repeat problems look to regulators like isolated cases.\par \par \uc2 In early 2011, when Royale officials realized that they could not fix the ventilation at the Taylorsville plant where Ms. Farley worked, they moved her and a half-dozen other workers to the other Taylorsville site. Ms. Farley's symptoms grew worse there; the ventilation problems had been identified by OSHA in 2002 but never corrected.\par \par \uc2 If inspections are supposed to force companies to rectify problems and avoid future ones, that 2002 inspection was a failure. ''Not able to require the employer to implement engineering controls,'' the OSHA official wrote at the time, adding that the agency could not levy fines or mandate respirators because there was no federal safety standard involving nPB.\par \par \uc2 That was a legal judgment call, one that many workplace safety experts say illustrates OSHA's unwillingness to exert its full authority. Though the agency has the legal means to force companies to protect workers better from certain chemicals even when there is no specific exposure level established by the agency as safe, OSHA rarely invokes this power for fear of sapping limited resources if the matter ends up in court.\par \par \uc2 ''We do the best we can,'' said Kevin Beauregard, an assistant deputy OSHA commissioner in North Carolina, which is among 25 states deputized by the federal government to oversee worker safety programs. He said that before his office could act in such instances, it must first prove that workers were exposed to a substance whose hazards were recognized in the industry and that the exposure was avoidable.\par \par \uc2 OSHA also rates health hazards as a lower priority than safety threats. In 1996, for instance, inspectors discovered that a machine part hit a Royale worker in the groin. The agency threatened to fine the company a total of $120,000, adding $5,000 to the fine for each day that the company failed to repair the machine. But when nPB levels remained high during five visits between 2002 and 2011, the agency never increased the penalties. The proposed total for all of Royale's health-related fines was $20,800, an amount the agency later lowered.\par \par \uc2 Partly, the emphasis on safety enforcement is a numbers game. OSHA's performance is often measured by lawmakers, advocacy groups and the news media based on how many inspections it does in a year; an inspector can do five times as many safety inspections in the time it typically takes to do one focused on health, where the issues may be less clear-cut. And the agency tends to face less public pressure about health enforcement, because the harm done by these sorts of hazards typically does not show up for years.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, while the number of inspectors has grown under the Obama administration, OSHA still has just 2,400 responsible for overseeing roughly eight million work sites -- roughly one inspector per 60,000 workers, a ratio that has not changed since 1970. The federal budget for protecting workers is less than half of that set aside for protecting fish and wildlife.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Michaels, whose tenure leading OSHA since December 2009 has been characterized by more aggressive enforcement than that of his most recent predecessors, cites a deeper problem: the small amount that OSHA can levy in fines. The maximum penalty for a violation that causes a ''substantial probability of death -- or serious physical harm'' is $7,000. The highest fine for a willful and repeated violation is $70,000.\par \par \uc2 This, Mr. Michaels said, pales in comparison with fines of up to $130,000 that the Department of Agriculture can levy if a dairy company refuses to pay fees that help the federal government advertise milk products, or the $325,000 that the \uc2 Federal Communications Commission\uc2  can fine a TV or radio station for indecent content.\par \par \uc2 ''If the cost of compliance to our rules outweighs the penalties for breaking them, companies just take a 'catch me if you can' approach to worker safety and health,'' he said. And serious violations of the rules should not be misdemeanors, he said, but felonies, much like insider trading, tax crimes and antitrust violations.\par \par \uc2 But Jeff Ruch, the director of \uc2 Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility\uc2 , a public health advocacy organization, said that, on average, OSHA now conducts health inspections and collects air samples less than half as often as it did under the Reagan administration.\par \par \uc2 ''You can't hit someone with a fine,'' Mr. Ruch said, ''if you aren't on site looking to find the violations.''\par \par \uc2 Hard Calculus\par \par \uc2 As her truck crawled down a bumpy dirt road, Ms. Farley said she needed to go slowly because she could not afford to replace her duct-taped bumper if it fell off. Between money from breeding her four Rottweilers, food stamp assistance and the occasional help from her ex-husband or the local food bank, her finances leave little room for error.\par \par \uc2 She stopped in a field dotted with narrow white trailers to pick up Cosondra Little, another former Royale worker, who limped as she approached. Ms. Little lives with her 24-year-old daughter, SoSonia, who is unemployed. What fresh tomatoes, collard greens and other vegetables the two eat come mostly from scavenging on nearby fields when farmers allow it. This has been the case, Ms. Little said, ever since she lost her job at the cushion plant in May 2003.\par \par \uc2 ''My feet started to throw a fit,'' she said. First went her health insurance, then money for SoSonia's college tuition, then their savings, and finally the car.\par \par \uc2 ''You try getting a job around here without a car,'' Ms. Little said, riding along a wooded stretch of Highway 16 just south of Taylorsville.\par \par \uc2 Soon the two women arrived at Martha Cardenas's house, where they were joined by two others, one a former cushion maker, the other a current one. They had gathered to explain that Royale is not unique.\par \par \uc2 After small talk about Ms. Cardenas's empanadas, the women stacked their medical records on the table. Different plants, different doctors, same glue. Broken lives reduced to physicians' scribbles. ''Staggered gait,'' ''numb hands and feet,'' ''spinal pain.''\par \par \uc2 Usually the same medical advice, too: find a different job; stop working with the glue. It ''has been clearly documented as a cause of'' nerve damage, Ms. Little's doctor wrote to her boss about nPB.\par \par \uc2 But other jobs are hard to come by. And that is why everyone has wanted to keep Royale in business. ''Now none of us are working,'' Ms. Farley said. In Dr. Wofford's hesitant whistle-blower letter to OSHA, in a $50,000 loan that county officials gave to Royale, in OSHA's formula for lowering fines, there were vexing calculations seeking to strike the right balance between protecting jobs and safeguarding those holding them.\par \par \uc2 In Ms. Cardenas's house, the women were doing some math of their own. One tried to tally how many hours she had spent in the unemployment office. Another added up her credit card debt and counted her doctors' visits. But mostly the women listed the subtler costs of their injuries, like the pounds gained from immobility or the addiction concerns with pain pills.\par \par \uc2 As the women stood up to leave, several grabbed the wall for balance. Ms. Farley added a parting thought.\par \par \uc2 ''And all the while everyone thinks you're just faking,'' she said. The women agree that this is the worst part.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Sheri Farley says glue fumes led to neurological damage.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 When Angy Rivera, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was a young girl in New York City, she was sexually abused by her mother's boyfriend. He was eventually convicted and imprisoned, but only recently did Ms. Rivera find out that her cooperation with investigators had qualified her for a special benefit: a visa for victims of serious crimes.\par \par \uc2 Many young illegal immigrants across the country have similarly learned in recent months that they could be eligible for little-known visas that would allow them to put years of worrying about deportation behind them, immigration lawyers said.\par \par \uc2 These discoveries have come about as an unintended consequence of an immigration policy adopted last June by President Obama that allows young illegal immigrants, under certain conditions, to apply for the right to remain in the country temporarily and work.\par \par \uc2 The policy, called deferred action, has spurred hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to seek legal help, often for the first time in their lives. During these consultations, many have learned that they are eligible for other, more permanent, forms of immigration relief, like special visas for crime victims.\par \par \uc2 More than a dozen immigration lawyers around the country -- from private practice, advocacy organizations and university law clinics -- said that as many as a quarter of the young immigrants who have consulted with them about deferred action since last summer appeared to be eligible for visas or other relief.\par \par \uc2 ''This whole time I had been in the system already and no one had said anything to me or my mom,'' said Ms. Rivera, 22, who was born in Colombia and entered the United States on false immigration documents when she was 4. ''It was out of the blue for me.''\par \par \uc2 The unexpected visa eligibility for so many young people highlights a defining facet of illegal immigration and of the debate over immigration reform. Many illegal immigrants are so fearful of contact with the authorities, or thwarted by language and economic barriers, that they live in a kind of isolation that often prevents them from taking advantage of opportunities or services to which they are entitled under the law.\par \par \uc2 It is a measure of this isolation that not even Ms. Rivera knew that she was a candidate for a special visa -- even though she is an immigration advocate and writes a popular online advice column for young illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 She found out about her eligibility for the crime-victims visa, called a U visa, only last fall when she met with a lawyer at Atlas: DIY, a nonprofit group in New York City that works with young immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Her lawyer, Lauren Burke, said advocacy groups and government agencies had not always done an adequate job of informing illegal immigrants about their rights under the nation's complex immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 ''The onus is on the immigrant for him or her to find out the information,'' Ms. Burke said. ''But if you say, 'I need immigration help,' you are exposing so much about yourself and putting yourself at such risk.''\par \par \uc2 Deferred action allows recipients to work legally and live openly without fear of deportation. But it must be renewed after two years, and the program could be canceled by President Obama or his successors. As a result, illegal immigrants would generally prefer to obtain a green card or a visa that would open the door to permanent residency.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials insisted that they were being vigilant against false eligibility claims, which can result in criminal charges and deportation. Still, some opponents of more lenient policies have contended that deferred action and other immigration programs might tempt some illegal immigrants to commit fraud in order to qualify.\par \par \uc2 More than 438,000 people have applied for deferred action, and more than 411,000 have been scheduled for fingerprinting and photographs for background checks, the second step in the process. By some estimates, as many as 1.7 million people could be eligible for the reprieve under the program, which is open to people who meet certain conditions, including that they entered the country before they were 16 and were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Laura Lichter, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the wave of immigrants seeking legal help for the first time and discovering their eligibility for some kind of relief was ''one of the very good things'' to emerge from the deferred action policy.\par \par \uc2 Many of the young immigrants who have sought help for deferred action were victims of crimes or were abandoned, neglected or abused by a parent, making them eligible for visas under existing programs, lawyers said. Others have discovered that they were able to apply for permanent residency through a family connection.\par \par \uc2 Shelly, 25, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Jamaica, said that as she was talking about deferred action with a lawyer at \uc2 African Services Committee\uc2 , an immigrant assistance organization in Harlem, she found out she could petition for a green card under the Violence Against Women Act because she had been physically and emotionally abused for years by her American-born husband.\par \par \uc2 ''I felt like I was living again,'' recalled Shelly, who asked that her full name be withheld in order not to anger her husband, from whom she is estranged.\par \par \uc2 Federal immigration officials, led by Alejandro Mayorkas, director of \uc2 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2 , have conducted an outreach campaign in recent years about special visas.\par \par \uc2 Even before the deferred action program began, the number of special visas had been increasing in recent years, according to government statistics. In the 2012 federal fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, about 24,800 applications were submitted for the U visa, with about 10,100 approved, up from 6,800 applications and 5,800 approved in 2009, the first year that it was offered.\par \par \uc2 Another \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , who gave only her first initial, J., said she revealed to a lawyer during her deferred action consultation that she had been repeatedly raped by a smuggler when she was 11 as he helped her get to the United States from her home in Guyana.\par \par \uc2 With the help of Ms. Burke, the lawyer at Atlas: DIY, who is also supervising staff attorney at the New York Asian Women's Center, J. obtained the deferred action reprieve last year. She then filed a petition for a T visa, which is reserved for victims of human trafficking.\par \par \uc2 J., who is now 19 and a sophomore in college in New York, said that when she heard about the T visa, she started to cry, in part because she was angry with herself that she had never told a lawyer about her experience.\par \par \uc2 ''I felt that if I had said something earlier in my life then my situation could've been changed way before,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Angy Rivera, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , only recently found out she was eligible for an obscure visa.

\par\par \uc2 Washington; SECT\par {\*\bkmkstart toc10}{\*\bkmkend toc10}\b \uc2 Gender Bias Seen in Visas for Skilled Workers\b0\par\par\uc2 By ASHLEY PARKER   \par \uc2 1,161 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 March 2013\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony Monday afternoon arguing that the H-1B visa program, which covers highly skilled temporary foreign workers, often in high-tech fields, discriminates against women.\par \par \uc2 The hearing, which was devoted to issues women face in the immigration process, also focused on family reunification, and ways to help families -- and women specifically -- integrate into the legal immigration system.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think we should be setting up an either-or proposition -- even the most highly skilled immigrants, they have families, too,'' said Senator \uc2 Mazie Hirono\uc2 , Democrat of Hawaii, referring to what she described as a false, ''either-or'' choice between family-based immigration and high-skilled immigration. ''This is all about doing the kind of immigration reform that really supports the values we have in this country, and one of the values we have in this country is that family is important.''\par \par \uc2 Karen Panetta, the vice president for communications and public awareness for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in the United States of America, testified in her prepared remarks that ''the vast majority of H-1B workers are men.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Panetta's prepared testimony pointed to ''a serious gender imbalance in science, technology, engineering and math,'' as part of the reason that these H-1B visas in high-tech fields skew disproportionately toward men. But she noted: ''If a major immigration program effectively discriminated based on race or national origin, would that be O.K.?''\par \par \uc2 ''The I.E.E.E.-U.S.A. represents more American high-tech workers than anybody else, so we have sources,'' Ms. Panetta said Monday afternoon. ''One from inside the industry, looking at the offshoring companies that dominate the H-1B program, is that their global hiring is 70 percent men.'' But in the United States, where outsourcing companies get more than half of the limited number of H-1B visas, she added, ''the ratio is more like 85 percent men.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Panetta, whose organization has filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Department of Homeland Security to get data on the gender breakdown of H-1B visas, accused the government in her written testimony of ''stonewalling'' on their request.\par \par \uc2 ''How many women get H-1B visas?'' she said Monday.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said that there is not a gender-based cap for H-1B visas and that gender is not taken into account when deciding who qualifies for the program, so the department does not have this data readily available.\par \par \uc2 Ai-jen Poo, the director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, emphasized the need for domestic care workers who are illegal immigrants -- ''a growing workforce of mainly immigrant women who take care of our children, our aging loved ones and our homes,'' as she described them -- to be allowed some flexibility in proving that they have been living and working in the United States.\par \par \uc2 A nanny who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Ms. Poo said, most likely does not have pay stubs or tax forms to prove she worked for her employer because she largely exists in ''a paperless world.'' She called on the senators to accept ''proofs of presence as opposed to proof of employment'' when it comes to providing a work history for domestic care workers -- many of whom are female.\par \par \uc2 Another issue of concern is that immigration legislation that is likely to emerge from the Senate might eliminate the ability for United States citizens to sponsor their married adult children, as well as their siblings, on an immigrant visa. Currently, these two groups represent the third and fourth preference categories when it comes to family immigration, but there is some discussion that they might be reshuffled and ultimately cut during the coming immigration overhaul.\par \par \uc2 ''Our family is what permits us to be able to set root and really begin to build a life in this country,'' said Mee Moua, the president of the Asian American Justice Center. ''If those two categories were eliminated, unless some alternative version was put on the table, I think that it would just unfortunately affect women and their families.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Moua argued that large, extended families can be critical to helping immigrants become a productive and integrated part of American society.\par \par \uc2 ''Family immigration is critical to our economy, and we know that our communities and all Americans benefit when we're able to provide immigrants with an opportunity to set roots,'' she said. ''We know that siblings provide immigrants an immediate social support system, that is able to help them with child care or if they fall on hard times, or instances where they need some help to start a business. The family network is what has helped our immigrants, regardless of how you come to this country, survive and start a life in this country.\par \par \uc2 ''Children will always be our children, whether they're over the age of 21 or not.'' she said. ''For us to start to think about which members of our family we're going to trade away is a dramatic and drastic departure from the core values of what has been driving this country since our founding days.''\par \par \uc2 Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, however, was not so convinced that all family members of immigrants deserved special consideration, simply because they have family in the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''Because a person chooses to leave their home country and come to the United States does not necessarily mean they have the right to demand that their father or their other extended family members be allowed to come if they don't otherwise meet the standard,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, on Monday also introduced legislation that, he said, would help overhaul the H-1B visa system.\par \par \uc2 ''Somewhere along the line, the H-1B program got side-tracked,'' Mr. Grassley said in an e-mail statement. ''The program was never meant to replace qualified American workers, but it was instead intended as a means to fill gaps in highly specialized areas of employment. When times are tough, like they are now, it's especially important that Americans get every consideration before an employer looks to hire from abroad. The legislation will benefit the American worker, while still ensuring that U.S. companies get the specialized workers they need.''\par \par \uc2 Only four members of the committee -- Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota; Mr. Grassley; Ms. Hirono; and Mr. Sessions -- attended Monday's hearing. None of the committee members who are also part of the bipartisan \uc2 group of eight\uc2  senators working on comprehensive immigration legislation showed up.\par \par \uc2 Monday's hearing also kicked off a weeklong series of events on Capitol Hill as part of the ''We Belong Together'' campaign, in which hundreds of women from 24 states will call for an immigration overhaul that specifically addresses the challenges that female immigrants face.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020130319e93j000bn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc11}{\*\bkmkend toc11}\b \uc2 North Carolina to Give Some Immigrants Driver's Licenses, With a Pink Stripe\b0\par\par\uc2 By KIM SEVERSON; Julia Preston contributed reporting from New York.   \par \uc2 884 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 March 2013\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RALEIGH, N.C. -- In a move some are calling a modern-day scarlet letter and others say is the best way to manage changing federal immigration policy, North Carolina this month will begin giving some young immigrants driver's licenses marked with a bold pink stripe and the words ''no lawful status'' printed in red.\par \par \uc2 The licenses were developed as a way for the state to cope with a quirk in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which the Obama administration began last year to deal with the as many as 1.7 million young immigrants across the country who were brought to the United States by their parents and have been living here illegally since.\par \par \uc2 Under the program, young people who qualify receive deferrals from deportation for two years. They are no longer illegal, but they do not become fully legal either.\par \par \uc2 While the program allows them work permits, many still need to drive to their jobs. So in January, the federal agency that administers the program determined that immigrants with deferrals were just legal enough to qualify for driver's licenses.\par \par \uc2 Although a majority of states are issuing the licenses, each is choosing a different path. Ohio officials leave it up to individual motor vehicle offices, although two state senators this week introduced a bill to make the licenses mandatory.\par \par \uc2 Michigan officials announced last month that they would hand out licenses after first refusing, a move that had brought a lawsuit from the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  and the National Immigration Law Center.\par \par \uc2 The governors of Arizona and Nebraska still will not issue driver's licenses. In February, national legal rights and immigration groups filed a federal class-action lawsuit challenging Arizona's position on constitutional grounds.\par \par \uc2 At first, North Carolina balked, too. When the state's attorney general ruled in January that the licenses were legal, the state Transportation Department devised what officials believed was a way to thread the needle between opposing factions.\par \par \uc2 Gov. \uc2 Pat McCrory\uc2 , the newly elected Republican, has called the pink-trimmed licenses ''a pragmatic compromise.''\par \par \uc2 But for some of the nearly 15,000 people who have applied for status under the deferred action program in North Carolina, the pink-tinged licenses are humiliating. They say the licenses could set them up for more harassment in a state that, like many, is struggling to cope with changing demographics.\par \par \uc2 ''More than anything, it's that we are already targeted,'' said Jose Rico, 23, whose parents arrived in the United States from Mexico on a tourist visa when he was 13 and have never left.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rico is studying engineering at a Durham community college and is part of the N. C. Dream Team, a grass-roots organization of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youth.\par \par \uc2 He worries that with a pink-striped license he will get harassed at bars, banks and airports -- the places where people regularly present a driver's license without a second thought.\par \par \uc2 ''It says right there you have no lawful status, which is true, but you are giving that to people who do not need to know your status,'' he said. ''It only opens us up for more harassment.''\par \par \uc2 On Monday, a group of Democratic legislators introduced a bill to make sure that all driver's licenses issued by the state were indistinguishable.\par \par \uc2 ''It is offensive to me that the governor would put a stigma upon young people who are legal,'' said State Representative Paul Luebke, Democrat of Durham, one of the bill's sponsors. He is particularly concerned about how the licenses might affect the holder's job prospects.\par \par \uc2 ''Why should someone who has gone through the process and gotten their papers have to go through hoops to explain to a potential employer exactly who they are because they have a driver's license with a pink stripe on it?'' Mr. Luebke said.\par \par \uc2 Some Republican lawmakers opposed to issuing any licenses at all to the young immigrants have introduced their own bills, asking that the licenses not be issued until June, by which time they hope to determine if the governor has stretched his constitutional powers.\par \par \uc2 Members of religious groups in North Carolina have also criticized the state's decision to issue the licenses.\par \par \uc2 When Rabbi John Friedman told members of Judea Reform Congregation in Durham about the new licenses at services Friday, he said he heard an audible gasp. He and other clergy members are encouraging their followers to stick a piece of pink tape on their licenses in solidarity and protest.\par \par \uc2 ''It's punitive,'' said the Rev. \uc2 Richard Edens\uc2  of the \uc2 United Church\uc2  of Chapel Hill. ''It just continues a sense of shame and humiliation.''\par \par \uc2 North Carolina also plans to issue a new generation of driver's licenses for the entire state by the end of the year. There will be distinguishing marks for other noncitizens, including permanent residents and other visa holders, but it is unclear whether the pink stripes will continue, said Greer Beaty, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department.\par \par \uc2 On March 25, North Carolina will begin giving specially  marked licenses to immigrants who came here as children.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Federal immigration officials have released hundreds of detainees from detention centers around the country in recent days in a highly unusual effort to save money as automatic budget cuts loom in Washington, officials said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The government has not dropped the deportation cases against the immigrants, however. The detainees have been freed on supervised release while their cases continue in court, officials said.\par \par \uc2 But the decision angered many Republicans, including Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, who said the releases were a political gambit by the Obama administration that undermined the continuing negotiations over comprehensive immigration reform and jeopardized public safety.\par \par \uc2 ''It's abhorrent that President Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration,'' said Mr. Goodlatte, who, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is running the House hearings on immigration reform. ''By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives.''\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, said the detainees selected for release were ''noncriminals and other low-risk offenders who do not have serious criminal histories.''\par \par \uc2 Officials said the releases, which began last week and continued on Tuesday, were a response to the possibility of automatic governmentwide budget cuts, known as sequestration, which are scheduled to take effect on Friday.\par \par \uc2 ''As fiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration, ICE has reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICE's current budget,'' the agency's spokeswoman, Gillian M. Christensen, said in a statement. The agency's budget for custody operations in the current fiscal year is $2.05 billion, officials said, and as of Saturday, ICE was holding 30,773 people in its detention system.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials said Tuesday that they had no plans to release substantially more detainees this week, though they warned that more releases were still possible depending on the outcome of budget negotiations.\par \par \uc2 They refused to specify exactly how many detainees were released, or where the releases took place. But immigrants' advocates around the country have reported that detainees were freed in several places, including Hudson County, N.J.; Polk County, Tex.; Broward County, Fla.; New Orleans; and from centers in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia and New York.\par \par \uc2 While immigration officials occasionally free detainees on supervised release, immigration advocates said that the surge of recent releases -- so many in such a short span of time -- was extraordinary.\par \par \uc2 Under supervised release, defendants in immigration cases have to adhere to a strict reporting schedule that might include attending appointments at a regional immigration office as well as wearing electronic monitoring bracelets, officials said.\par \par \uc2 Advocacy groups, citing the cost of detaining immigrants, have for years argued that the federal government should make greater use of less expensive alternatives to detention for low-risk defendants being held on administrative charges.\par \par \uc2 One such group, the National Immigration Forum, estimated last year that it cost from $122 to $164 a day to hold a detainee in the federal immigration system. In contrast, the organization said, alternative forms of detention could cost from 30 cents to $14 a day per immigrant.\par \par \uc2 Among those released in the past week was Anthony Orlando Williams, 52, a Jamaican immigrant who spent nearly three years in a detention center in Georgia. ''I'm good, man,'' he said. ''I'm free.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Williams, in a telephone interview from Stone Mountain, Ga., said he became an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  when he overstayed a visa in 1991. He was detained in 2010 by a sheriff's deputy in Gwinnett County, Ga., when it was discovered that he had violated probation for a conviction in 2005 of simple assault, simple battery and child abuse, charges that sprung from a domestic dispute with his wife at the time. He was transferred to ICE custody and has been fighting a deportation order with the help of Families for Freedom, an immigrant support group in New York.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Williams was released last Friday. ''That was a long, long, long run,'' he said of his detention, adding that he has an appointment this Friday at an immigration office in Atlanta at which he expects to receive the terms of his supervised release -- ''a list of things I have to abide by.''\par \par \uc2 Human Rights First\uc2 , another advocacy group in New York, which has been pressing for reform of the immigration detention system, said that 96 percent of immigrants enrolled in ICE's alternatives-to-detention program attended their final hearing in 2011. That figure was up from the year before, in which 93 percent attended their final court hearings, said the group, citing statistics provided by B.I., a private contractor that provides monitoring and supervision services to ICE.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants' advocates applauded the releases but pressed the Obama administration to do more, including adhering more closely to its declared enforcement priorities and leaving alone immigrants accused of low-level crimes and administrative immigration violations.\par \par \uc2 ''It shouldn't take a manufactured crisis in Washington to prompt our immigration agencies to actually take steps towards using government resources wisely or keeping families together,'' said Carolina Canizales, a leader of United We Dream, the nation's largest group of young illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is also holding immigration hearings, said the releases ''lessened the chances'' that legislators might reach a bipartisan accord on comprehensive immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 ''It is clear the administration is using the sequester as a convenient excuse to bow to political pressure from the amnesty groups,'' he said. ''With this new action, the administration has further demonstrated that it has no commitment to enforcing the law and cannot be trusted to deliver on any future promises of enforcement.''\par \par \uc2 Other Republicans, however, shrugged off the releases, saying they expected that the administration would use the excuse of sequestration to take attention-grabbing action and that they were prepared for more in the coming days.\par \par \uc2 Anthony Orlando Williams was released last week after nearly three years in an immigration detention center in Georgia.

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 The Obama administration spent nearly $18 billion on immigration enforcement last year, significantly more than its spending on all the other major federal law enforcement agencies combined, according to a report published Monday by the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , a nonpartisan research group in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Based on the vast resources devoted to monitoring foreigners coming into the country and to detaining and deporting illegal immigrants, immigration control has become ''the federal government's highest criminal law enforcement priority,'' the report concluded.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, it found, the two main immigration enforcement agencies under the Department of Homeland Security have referred more cases to the courts for prosecution than all of the Justice Department's law enforcement agencies combined, including the F.B.I., the \uc2 Drug Enforcement Administration\uc2  and the \uc2 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\uc2 . Total spending on those agencies was $14 billion, official figures show.\par \par \uc2 The 182-page report was an opening salvo in a contentious debate over immigration that President Obama has pledged to lead this year. Its purpose was to marshal publicly available official figures to show that the country has built ''a formidable enforcement machinery'' since 1986, the last time Congress considered an overhaul of the immigration laws that included measures granting legal status to large numbers of illegal immigrants. Spending on immigration enforcement was 15 times greater last year than in 1986, the report found.\par \par \uc2 The report responds to lawmakers, mainly Republicans, who have argued that federal authorities must do much more to strengthen enforcement before Congress can consider any legalization for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country.\par \par \uc2 ''The 'enforcement first' policy that has been advocated by many in Congress and the public as a precondition for considering broader immigration reform has de facto become the nation's singular immigration policy,'' the report concluded.\par \par \uc2 Although the institute includes both Democrats and Republicans and did not offer any recommendations in this report, it has previously supported policies to bring illegal immigrants into the legal system, rather than expelling them.\par \par \uc2 According to the report, financing, staffing and technology investments for the Border Patrol have reached ''historic highs,'' while apprehensions of illegal border crossers have plunged by 53 percent since 2008. As a result of huge increases in spending, deportations have also ''increased dramatically,'' the report says, with far more immigrants removed in expedited proceedings that do not involve any formal proceeding before an immigration judge.\par \par \uc2 The budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which handles interior enforcement and detention, has increased by 87 percent since 2005, to nearly $6 billion, according to the report. The number of foreigners the agency detains annually increased to 429,247 in 2011. In December, the agency announced it had deported 410,000 foreigners in 2012, giving Mr. Obama the record for the highest number of removals during his term.\par \par \uc2 ''As a result of 25 years of investment,'' said Doris Meissner, an author of the report who is a senior fellow at the institute, ''the bulwark is fundamentally in place.'' She said the existing system made it unlikely that an immigration overhaul could unleash a new wave of illegal migration, like the surge since the amnesty of 1986.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Meissner, who served as commissioner of the immigration service in the Clinton administration, said public perceptions of uncontrolled migration across the border with Mexico ''have not caught up with the reality.''\par \par \uc2 Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, federal law enforcement agencies have revamped and coordinated databases for monitoring the movement of foreigners into the country. An immigration databank that federal authorities have created is the ''largest law enforcement electronic verification system in the world,'' said \uc2 Donald Kerwin\uc2 , another author of the report.\par \par \uc2 Some critics said the report's figures were misleading because they include the entire budget for Customs and Border Protection, another Department of Homeland Security agency, which also oversees cargo inspections on land and at seaports.\par \par \uc2 ''A large amount of that spending has nothing to do with immigrants,'' said \uc2 Mark Krikorian\uc2 , the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization that supports tough measures against illegal immigration. Immigration enforcement still has ''gaping holes,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 One of them, Mr. Krikorian said, is the lack of a national system for employers to verify that new hires are legally authorized to work. He also noted that the United States still has no system to confirm that foreigners leave the country when their visas expire.\par \par \uc2 Other experts said the report was an accurate summary of a recent transformation in immigration control. ''There is no question that there has been a big, big increase in enforcement across the board,'' said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the \uc2 Council on Foreign Relations\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A man suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico was searched by a federal immigration officer in Phoenix last April.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 I learned that a local business, which I patronize perhaps twice a month for lunch, has been in trouble for employing undocumented workers. I'm not sure what to think of the ethics of that, though the illegality is clear. I'm wondering whether I have any ethical obligation as a citizen and customer to stop going there. LAURIE HURSHMAN, NEW HAVEN, CONN.\par \par \uc2 It's true that employing undocumented workers is illegal, and it's possible you don't wish to be involved with any organization that breaks the law. But this kind of law operates outside the boundaries of traditional ethics. Obviously, this is not true for all laws: if murder were somehow legalized, killing innocent people would still be morally wrong, based on an ingrained belief in the sanctity of human life. But this is a different kind of statute. If the laws governing undocumented workers were suddenly reversed, it would be seen merely as a policy change. Some people would agree with the modification and others would not, but both sides of the argument would be almost entirely political. Undocumented workers take potential jobs from U.S. citizens, but who is to say citizenship is a moral justification for employment?\par \par \uc2 Undocumented workers don't always contribute to the tax base, but they also put themselves in a precarious, unprotected position where they can be underpaid in cash, to the nefarious benefit of the employer. An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can't legally work at a restaurant to support his family, but his 16-year-old son can, if he happened to be born here. There are contradictions on both sides. You admit you're ''not sure what to think'' about this restaurant's employment practice, which is an acceptable way to feel about an issue that lacks a straightforward moral answer; you're aware of the illegality, but those laws apply only to the owner and the workers (not the consumer). So if you can't personally isolate why it's ethically wrong, there's no reason to stop eating there.\par \par \uc2 But let's take this further. Let's say you thought about this problem deeply and came to the conclusion that it was unethical for restaurants to employ undocumented workers. This prompts one of the more difficult questions in modern living: Is it wrong to contribute -- in any way -- to businesses or organizations that contradict your ethical beliefs? There is a mode of thinking that insists that it is and that living ethically requires us to assess every day-to-day decision through the prism of its impact on the wider world. But what that entails in a practical sense is pretty unreasonable, unless ''living ethically'' is the only thing you care about. To do so would paralyze every moment of every day and consume you entirely. For example, let's say you view military drone strikes as unethical (an issue far graver than restaurant employees). The U.S. government regularly conducts drone strikes. Does this mean that you should not support any business that pays federal taxes (and thereby provides support for military activities)? Does it mean you should not pay income tax because that makes you part of the problem? Does it mean you need to consider every single extension of the government, weigh their ethical merits against your own and then decide whether you still support the idea of living in America? These are all interesting questions to ask yourself while eating at this restaurant.\par \par \uc2 THE (POLITICAL) BOSS\par \par \uc2 Can I politically disagree with an artist and still love the art? I'm a conservative person who happens to love Bruce Springsteen apart from the political causes he champions. Is an artist ethically just in rejecting a fan for not supporting him politically? Am I a fool for supporting an artist who would personally reject me over my political beliefs? JAMIE McINTYRE, BRAINTREE, MASS.\par \par \uc2 Artists have no ethical responsibility to reflect -- or even consider -- the views of their fan base. This is one-way, mediated entertainment: Springsteen makes music and creates a persona, and you get to decide if that product is something you want in your life. And since the only tangible relationship you have with Springsteen is his music, there's no problem with your seemingly contradictory support. How you experience and interpret his work is your choice (the artist can instruct otherwise, but he can't enforce that instruction once his art enters the public sphere). A performer can stop a song from being co-opted by a politician, but he can't demand that consumers dislike that politician.\par \par \uc2 As for Springsteen's hypothetical rejection of you and your belief system: that's a strange thing to worry about. For one thing, he might not reject you at all (he'd likely disagree with your opinions, but that's not the same thing). And -- more important -- it would not matter if he did. His music doesn't reject you. Besides, an artist's political expression is not a contract with the audience. In the liner notes of Nirvana's 1992 release ''Incesticide,'' Kurt Cobain outlined the type of person he did not want buying his music. It was the most direct attempt at fan rejection imaginable. Yet even that message could be read only if the shrink-wrapped CD was purchased and opened. The only people he could ''reject'' were those who had already bought his work, so his request was ultimately symbolic. It was a way to say, ''This is how I look at the world, so listen with that worldview in mind.'' When Springsteen talks about politics, he's doing the same thing. Now, perhaps you don't want to be a fan of anyone who doesn't mirror your political biases. That's your prerogative. But that suggests you're interested in something other than music.\par \par \uc2 E-mail queries to ethicist@nytimes.com, or send them to the Ethicist, The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2 , 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10018, and include a daytime phone number.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING   \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020121209e8c9000ay\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDTucked in a box of photos and other mementos kept by Angie Escobar is a newspaper article from several years ago. It is one of the first articles Ms. Escobar, 23, read about the Dream Act, the proposed legislation intended to give certain undocumented young people a path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 ''The article mentions a young person who wanted to become a police officer, but couldn't because only citizens are allowed,'' she said. ''I could relate to him, to have the desire to go far in a career but not being able to even begin.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Escobar is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Colombia. Her mother, Tulia Mendez, brought her and Ms. Escobar's sister, Jessica, to the United States in October 1992, when Angie was 3 and Jessica 2.\par \par \uc2 The legislation known as the Dream Act stalled in Congress; President Obama endorsed the program as created through an executive action by \uc2 Janet Napolitano\uc2 , secretary of Homeland Security. To be eligible, applicants must have been in this country and younger than 31 on June 15, when the program was announced. Applicants must also have been younger than 16 when they arrived in this country and have lived here continuously for five years. The program offers a two-year deferral of deportation, which can be renewed.\par \par \uc2 For Ms. Escobar, reading that article in her high school years had a particular impact. It was a time in her life when she was beginning to realize the many opportunities that would be lost to her, like obtaining a driver's license or accompanying friends during spring break on trips out of the country. Being here illegally also meant that she would be ineligible for federal financial aid for college.\par \par \uc2 The knowledge that her daughter's plans were in jeopardy was especially hard for Ms. Mendez. Her unflinching belief that America would offer a wealth of opportunities had motivated her hard choice to make a grueling journey with children so young.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Mendez is often reluctant to discuss the details of the four-month trek from Cali, though she has shared stories with her daughters that highlighted what was at stake. She tells of nighttime hikes through forests, riding in boats that had been filled well beyond their capacity, and being repeatedly detained by the authorities in Mexico, who sent the family to Guatemala, the country of origin Ms. Mendez had falsely given them.\par \par \uc2 ''I cried a lot because I didn't see us getting there,'' Ms. Mendez says of the United States.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Escobar and her sister finally entered the United States as passengers in the van of a Mexican couple who told border officials that the girls were their children. Ms. Mendez said she hid in a hollowed-out compartment beneath one of the seats. Once in Texas, the three flew to New York City, where they were greeted by family members.\par \par \uc2 The family has resided in different parts of Queens over the past 20 years and now lives in Whitestone. When she was 15, Ms. Escobar said, she was hired as a supermarket cashier and began to save money. She learned that her illegal status made it difficult to hold steady work.\par \par \uc2 ''I knew going into one job that I was only going to be there for a certain amount of months,'' Ms. Escobar said. ''My friend was working there already, and said for the first few months they'll pay you cash because it's training, but then they are going to ask you for your Social'' -- her Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 After high school, Ms. Escobar took an off-the-books job at a catering company, where she often worked shifts of 16 to 18 hours. In 2008, she began her first semester at Queensborough Community College; her stepfather paid the bill.\par \par \uc2 Tuition increased the next year, forcing her to leave school. It was not until 2011 that Ms. Escobar had saved up enough money to return. In order to catch up, she took six classes her first semester back and another six classes the following semester.\par \par \uc2 In October, Ms. Escobar sought to take advantage of the deferred action program, which would permit her work authorization for two years.\par \par \uc2 After being laid off in September, and unable to afford the $465 application fee for deferral, Ms. Escobar reached out to Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the agencies supported by The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Neediest Cases Fund. The agency drew a grant from the fund to cover the cost of the application.\par \par \uc2 ''I won't be able to apply for financial aid even with deferred action,'' Ms. Escobar said. ''But it would give me the opportunity to get a job legally, so I would be able to work on the books at a stable job so I can save more money.''\par \par \uc2 Her sister, Jessica, now 22, also hopes to gain deferred action status. Ms. Mendez obtained permanent residency through her marriage in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Escobar is on track to receive her associate degree in December and is job hunting.\par \par \uc2 She wants to enroll at Queens College, with a major in psychology and a minor in education so that she can become a school counselor, all with the hope of attaining citizenship one day.\par \par \uc2 ''The Dream Act is real and people were and are talking about it,'' she said. ''I really didn't think it would take this long. Yet I still have hope. It's just a matter of time until everyone is on the same page.''\par \par \uc2 HOW TO HELP: The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Neediest Cases Fund has begun a special campaign to raise money in support of Hurricane Sandy relief efforts in the New York metropolitan area.

The program, under which deportation is deferred for eligible applicants, was created through an executive action by \uc2 Janet Napolitano\uc2 , the secretary of Homeland Security, and was endorsed by President Obama. It was not created by an executive order of the president.\par \par \uc2 Angie Escobar, right, a college student and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ,  with her mother, Tulia Mendez, center, and sister, Jessica. She  is applying to stay under the deferred action program.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Thousands of illegal immigrants living in Massachusetts can qualify for state resident tuition rates at state colleges, under a policy laid out on Monday by Gov. \uc2 Deval Patrick\uc2  -- another shift in the fast-changing mosaic of states' policies toward that population.\par \par \uc2 The shift builds on the Obama administration policy, adopted in June, that the federal government will not seek to deport most young immigrants who, as children, were either brought to the United States illegally or kept here illegally. The Massachusetts policy applies to that same group.\par \par \uc2 Officials say there are very few illegal immigrants currently enrolled who might benefit from the in-state tuition discount; the much larger effect will be in encouraging others to enroll. They estimate that Massachusetts has 15,000 to 17,000 residents in the age group affected by the change in the deportation policy; they would not guess how many might take advantage of new state and federal rules.\par \par \uc2 ''Our experience has been that the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition is a prohibitive barrier,'' said Paul Reville, the state's secretary of education. The state's flagship college, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, charges state residents $13,230 in tuition and fees; students from outside the state pay more than twice as much, $26,645.\par \par \uc2 ''Some states are playing real hardball on college tuition and other benefits, while others are moving toward accommodation, and it's changing all the time,'' said Michael A. Olivas, a University of Houston law professor who tracks the issue around the country.\par \par \uc2 By his count, 12 states have laws allowing illegal immigrants to claim state residency and pay in-state tuition; this month, Maryland became the first to adopt such a law by popular vote. The others are California, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 He lists six other states -- Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio and South Carolina -- that have adopted laws explicitly barring illegal immigrants from qualifying for in-state tuition. A law enacted in Alabama in 2011 prohibits such people from attending state colleges at all, but it faces legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 Many other states do not have laws on the books to address the question but rely on a range of policies that are also in flux. In August, a New Jersey appellate court struck down a state practice that prevented an American citizen from claiming residency and in-state tuition because her mother was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some states charge illegal residents the lower rate but do not allow them to qualify for state financial aid; California is scheduled to begin providing them financial aid on Jan. 1.\par \par \uc2 And the battles over states' treatment of illegal immigrants extends beyond college, to questions like granting driver's licenses or inquiring about immigration status in routine police matters.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration policy applies to anyone who arrived in the United States before turning 16, has lived here for at least five years, is under the age of 31, has no serious criminal record, and either is in school, has a high school diploma or equivalent, or has been honorably discharged from the armed services.\par \par \uc2 Young people can apply to the \uc2 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2  agency for formal recognition under the policy, which automatically qualifies them for a work permit.\par \par \uc2 The number of people who qualify may be over one million, but about 300,000 have applied so far to be formally recognized by the federal government. Advocates say that many immigrants did not want to step forward until after the election, because \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  had said he would overturn the policy if elected president. When he was governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney vetoed a bill that would have granted in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. Since then, such bills have stalled in the legislature, despite urging from Mr. Patrick.\par \par \uc2 The governor's action on Monday is more clarification than new policy. Since 2008, the state has recognized an immigrant's federal work permit as evidence of state residency, qualifying students for lower tuition.\par \par \uc2 Officials said that in the wake of the new federal rules, there were questions about whether the state would treat the newly granted work permits the same way. On Monday, the governor informed the state higher education system that it would.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020121120e8bk000a6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECTP\par {\*\bkmkstart toc17}{\*\bkmkend toc17}\b \uc2 Electorate Reverts to a Partisan Divide as Obama's Support Narrows\b0\par\par\uc2 By JACKIE CALMES and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN   \par \uc2 1,134 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 November 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 With voters worn by hard times yet many of them hopeful of better times ahead, Americans reverted to more traditional lines compared with the broader-based coalition that made \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  president four years ago.\par \par \uc2 President Obama held onto the demographic groups that traditionally make up his party's base -- young and unmarried people, political moderates, women, blacks, Latinos, the least and most educated, city dwellers, lower-income voters and union members -- yet struggled with others who helped sweep him to victory in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Men, political independents and suburbanites -- who backed Mr. Obama four years ago -- this time gave more votes to \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , according to Edison Research surveys of voters leaving the polls and of telephone interviews with some of the roughly 30 million Americans who voted early.\par \par \uc2 The president did barely hold onto college graduates and mothers, two groups that until 2008 were a mainstay of the Republican Party, and he hung onto Roman Catholics. Mr. Obama and his campaign assiduously courted the groups, just as last time. But he lost the independents who were among the most closely watched groups in the crucial swing states of Ohio and Virginia, except in Florida, where he had a narrow edge late in the evening.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romney retained the support of most other typically Republican groups, including whites, older Americans, Southerners, rural residents, married voters, regular churchgoers and, overwhelmingly, white evangelical Christians, many of whom expressed hostility toward Mr. Romney, as a Mormon, in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps indicating their antipathy to Mr. Obama, white evangelical Christians were more supportive of Mr. Romney than they were of Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , the Republican nominee of 2008, and roughly as supportive as they were of President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 . And Mr. Obama's support among Jewish voters slipped by eight points.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romney got the votes of more whites than Mr. McCain, and, unlike Mr. McCain, he was supported by a majority of white voters under age 30.\par \par \uc2 In short, the electorate this year looked a lot more like that of 2004, when Mr. Bush narrowly defeated Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, to win re-election, than Mr. Obama's diverse majority of 2008. The shifts among major demographic groups were first seen in the 2010 midterm elections, when the Democrats lost control of Congress as the economy sputtered. But Democrats made up a larger share of the electorate, similar to 2008, at 38 percent, with 32 percent identifying as Republicans and 30 percent as independents.\par \par \uc2 Significantly, the electorate's view of the government's role in the economy has shifted away from Mr. Obama's call for a kind of public-private partnership, and toward Mr. Romney's hands-off, free-market platform.\par \par \uc2 In November 2008, when the country was floundering in the worst recession since the Depression, Election Day surveys of voters found that 51 percent of them wanted government to do more to intervene while 43 percent said it was doing too many things better left to businesses. Now, after four years of government activism, those numbers have flipped.\par \par \uc2 In some states where government intervention like the auto bailout was palpable, however, Mr. Obama benefited. For example, Ohio voters overwhelmingly supported the 2009 federal aid to automakers, according to surveys of those who voted, and about three-quarters of them backed Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 This was no surprise: a big majority nationally said the economy was the most important issue. Majorities of those voters and of the smaller portion who called federal budget deficits the nation's primary issue supported Mr. Romney. Mr. Obama won most voters who named foreign policy or health care as their top concern.\par \par \uc2 A majority still blames Mr. Bush more than Mr. Obama for the economy's lingering problems. That helps explain how the president remained a formidable contender for a second term though no modern incumbent had won re-election with an unemployment rate near 8 percent.\par \par \uc2 So does the growing share of voters who view the economy's condition -- and their own -- as improving. Four in 10 said the economy is getting better, and they overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama. Those who said it is ''staying the same'' or getting worse backed Mr. Romney.\par \par \uc2 As in national polls before the election, just over half of voters said the country is on the wrong track. Still, 54 percent of voters approved of Mr. Obama's job performance, about the same rating that Mr. Bush had when he was re-elected.\par \par \uc2 The president was probably helped in the campaign's final week by his widely praised handling of the federal government's response to Hurricane Sandy. Nearly two-thirds of voters said it was a factor in their vote; those who called it important chose Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 He was seen generally as more empathetic and better able to handle Medicare and an international crisis. The two were about even when it came to who was better able to handle the economy and the federal budget deficit.\par \par \uc2 Three-fifths of voters said they opposed raising taxes to help cut the deficit, a finding that favored Mr. Romney. But almost half support higher taxes on incomes over $250,000, as Mr. Obama has proposed.\par \par \uc2 The Obama campaign's emphasis on winning Latino voters seemed to pay off. Mr. Obama maintained support among Latino voters, who are about one in 10 of the electorate, and growing, including in swing states and Republican states like Texas.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama got about 7 in 10 Latinos and more than 9 of 10 black voters. He also won overwhelming support from the small, growing slice of voters who are Asian-Americans.\par \par \uc2 Some Republican leaders have warned of the danger for their party as the nation becomes less white if Democrats solidify the allegiance of such ethnic groups as Latinos and Asian-Americans, or, conversely, if Republicans forfeit it by perpetuating their image as a party hostile to immigrants. A few leaders, like former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, warned Mr. Romney during the Republican nomination race that his hard-line stand on immigration could backfire.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama, aides say, will try to enlist Republicans in Congress to overhaul immigration law, and the voter surveys provided ammunition: two-thirds said \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers should be ''offered a chance to apply for legal status.''\par \par \uc2 Seven in 10 voters said they made up their mind before September; they favored Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 CHARTS: Voters and Issues: Based on nationwide exit polls.; Compared to four years ago, is your family's situation:; Do you think things in this country today are:; Who is more to blame for current economic problems?; What should happen to the 2010 health care law?   \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020121107e8b70004d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc18}{\*\bkmkend toc18}\b \uc2 Undocumented Life Is a Hurdle As Immigrants Seek a Reprieve\b0\par\par\uc2 By KIRK SEMPLE   \par \uc2 1,555 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Chul Soo, a 27-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from South Korea, has lived on the fringes of society in recent years, working off the books at a video game store and a beauty supplies wholesaler in New York City, carrying neither a driver's license nor credit cards, and having little contact with the government.\par \par \uc2 Now he is applying for a new program that offers illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children a reprieve from deportation if they can demonstrate that they have been in the country since 2007, among other requirements. Yet Chul Soo, who said he arrived in 1995, is finding that he has little in the way of proof of his whereabouts for the last five years.\par \par \uc2 ''It's frustrating,'' he said, referring to his effort to piece together a mosaic of records. ''I really need this right now.''\par \par \uc2 Since President Obama announced the program in June, illegal immigrants across the country have been scrambling to collect evidence to qualify.\par \par \uc2 Their challenge is this: How do you document an undocumented life?\par \par \uc2 Applicants must prove that they were brought to the United States before they turned 16; that they have lived here continuously for the past five years; and that they were in the country and were under age 31 on June 15. They must show that they are enrolled in school or have graduated from high school or received an equivalent G.E.D. certificate, or have been honorably discharged from the military. An immigrant who poses a threat to national security or has been convicted of a felony, a serious misdemeanor or three minor misdemeanors will be rejected.\par \par \uc2 Some illegal immigrants have lived lives nearly indistinguishable from those of citizens, amassing school transcripts, medical records and bank statements. But many have remained under the radar, appearing rarely, if at all, on official or business records.\par \par \uc2 To take part in the program, many have had to retrace their often-circuitous and sometimes clandestine paths in the United States. Some have had to take the uncomfortable step of calling former employers to request affidavits attesting to their prior arrangements -- at the risk of placing those employers in legal peril.\par \par \uc2 ''One of the most striking things is the desperation and sadness when you're talking to someone who absolutely qualifies but they can't provide documents that prove it,'' said Jacqueline Esposito, director of immigration advocacy at the \uc2 New York Immigration Coalition\uc2 , an umbrella group that has received about 1,400 requests for legal assistance since mid-August, when the federal government began accepting applications.\par \par \uc2 Chul Soo, who recently moved with his parents from Staten Island to Flushing, Queens, says he came to the United States when he was 10. (Chul Soo is his given name. Like other applicants interviewed, he requested that his family name be withheld because he was concerned that he was still vulnerable to deportation.)\par \par \uc2 His paper trail all but dried up after he dropped out of high school on Staten Island and got a G.E.D. certificate in the mid-2000s.\par \par \uc2 All he has to show are bits and pieces: a transcript from the Borough of Manhattan Community College, which he attended for one semester in 2007; tax records from 2009, when he worked for a few months as a dental technician trainee using a relative's Social Security number; recent pay stubs from his current job as a manager at an electronics company; and statements from a bank account that he opened for two months this year.\par \par \uc2 He is left with gaping holes for 2008, 2010 and 2011, and is working with lawyers at the MinKwon Center for Community Action, an advocacy group in Flushing, Queens, to fill them. He said he was considering approaching his two former bosses to request affidavits of support.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know why I have to go through all of this,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 For others, the process has been no more difficult than it would be for a citizen.\par \par \uc2 Hina, 22, a Pakistani immigrant who came to the United States with her family when she was 10, said she had the good fortune to have parents who saved everything -- tax documents, school correspondence, report cards, medical records, utility bills.\par \par \uc2 She said the family stepped up the archiving in recent years in light of the debate over the Dream Act, which would give legal status to young illegal immigrants. (The legislation has not been approved by Congress.)\par \par \uc2 Still, she noted, her parents -- illegal immigrants who do not qualify for the program -- wondered whether their children's applications might somehow lead to their deportation.\par \par \uc2 ''But my parents finally decided that it was worth the risk,'' Hina said. ''They came here for their children. It didn't make sense for all of us to sit here in the dark and wait this thing out.''\par \par \uc2 Last month, Hina submitted applications for herself, her younger brother and her sister. Her older brother applied separately.\par \par \uc2 But her experience seems to be relatively unusual.\par \par \uc2 Rigoberto, 23, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, arrived in the United States in 1995 with his family and has transcripts from the New York City public schools to establish his presence before he was 16 and for two of the past five years. But he lives with his father and works off-the-books in construction.\par \par \uc2 The only documentation he has from the past few years is a letter that he received from the Selective Service System a few months ago confirming that he had registered. He said he hoped it would at least show that he was in the country on June 15.\par \par \uc2 Rigoberto is considering asking his boss at a construction company to sign an affidavit testifying to his presence in the country this year.\par \par \uc2 ''Do you think he would get in trouble?'' Rigoberto asked.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocacy organizations around the United States have been swarmed by people seeking help with their applications to the new program, but lawyers said they were not entirely sure what the government allowed as proof.\par \par \uc2 The uncertainties, and the challenge of assembling the documents, may have contributed to a smaller-than-expected number of applications. Immigration authorities were preparing to receive as many as 250,000 in the first month of the program, but ended up with less than a third of that.\par \par \uc2 Applicants have been creative. Some have collated date-stamped \uc2 Facebook\uc2  photographs of themselves, said immigration lawyers and advocates. particularly those taken in front of recognizable American backdrops. Others have printed out records of activity on cellphone apps, like Four Square, and collected schedules and records of sports leagues in which they have played.\par \par \uc2 The Rev. Mark Hallinan of St. Mary of the Assumption on Staten Island said he had received dozens of requests for help. He and his staff have combed the parish archives for sacramental records of baptisms, communions and confirmations.\par \par \uc2 ''There's been a steady flow of persons coming in looking for, at minimum, a letter from me saying I recognize them as having participated in the life of the parish,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Yaida, 17, said that she was short just one document -- a Mexican passport, to prove her identity -- and that the quest for it had reopened family wounds.\par \par \uc2 Her father abandoned the family when Yaida was young. Her mother has been seeking to gain full custody over the children, but the process has been slow because Yaida's father, who lives in Mexico, is not cooperating.\par \par \uc2 Unless her mother secures full custody, Mexican law requires that Yaida also receive her father's authorization to obtain the passport. In the meantime, she waits.\par \par \uc2 ''I have all the school papers, I have the doctors' documents, I have church documents for confirmation,'' she said, her voice trailing off. ''I have everything except a passport.''\par \par \uc2 Luis, a 26-year-old Mexican immigrant, arrived in the United States in 2000 when he was 14, but his search has been complicated by moves and job changes and the fact that he has lived in both New York and Delaware.\par \par \uc2 He has pieced together a collage of documents from employers in both states, from G.E.D. programs and from a money-transfer company that he used to send remittances to relatives in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 One former employer at a restaurant in Delaware balked at his request for copies of old W-2 forms, Luis said. (He had been working and paying taxes under a fake Social Security number, he said.)\par \par \uc2 ''He told me, 'I don't want problems, I don't have time, I am busy, that was a long time ago, it will cost me some money,' '' Luis recalled. But Luis lobbied him with e-mails, phone calls and faxes asking for help. The employer finally agreed.\par \par \uc2 ''It was difficult, but now I am about to apply,'' he continued.

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc19}{\*\bkmkend toc19}\b \uc2 Greek Government Proposes Deep Budget Cuts in Bid to Please Foreign Lenders\b0\par\par\uc2 By RACHEL DONADIO and NIKI KITSANTONIS   \par \uc2 621 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATHENS -- Greece's government submitted its 2013 draft budget on Monday, outlining enormous spending cuts as the country's foreign lenders returned to resume talks over a broader austerity package in exchange for the rescue money the country needs to meet expenses.\par \par \uc2 The draft budget spells out about $10 billion in spending cuts and savings for 2013. About one-quarter of that would come through reductions in civil servants' salaries and social welfare benefits, and about 15 percent through cuts in spending on health, defense and local authorities, the government said. It also stipulates raising the retirement age to 67 from 65, but that is not expected to alter the bottom line in 2013.\par \par \uc2 The draft budget is expected to be revised significantly because it must be approved by the country's troika of foreign lenders -- the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 , the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  and the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  -- before it can be submitted for a parliamentary vote.\par \par \uc2 The troika is insisting on further cuts in the public sector -- including laying off public servants, a political third rail in Greece and other European countries -- while the coalition government has been pushing back. The coalition, which consists of the conservative \uc2 New Democracy\uc2 , the Socialists and the smaller Democratic Left party, is asking Greece's lenders for more time, saying such cuts are not politically or socially sustainable in the face of growing social unrest.\par \par \uc2 Labor unions said Monday that they would plan new protests as a follow-up to a 24-hour general strike last Wednesday, while the leftist Syriza opposition party said that overturning the conservative-led coalition government had become ''a battle of life or death for society.''\par \par \uc2 The negotiations are taking place against a backdrop of unrelenting, depression-level conditions in the Greek economy, which the draft budget predicted would contract by 6.5 percent this year and by 3.8 percent in 2013 -- far more than the troika's earlier estimates and about 25 percent below its peak before the crisis struck. The budget says unemployment is expected to rise to 24.7 percent from 23.5 percent this year.\par \par \uc2 But the blueprint also predicts that the country will post a primary surplus of 1.1 percent of gross domestic product next year after consecutive deficits since 2002.\par \par \uc2 Deputy Finance Minister Christos Staikouras, of \uc2 New Democracy\uc2 , said on Monday that the government would be in a position to pay off debts to third parties, estimated at some $9 billion, using money from rescue loans for 2012 and 2013. That would be a significant development because many private businesses are on the brink of bankruptcy as a result of the state being unable to pay them.\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the day, Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras resumed talks with visiting troika officials on a broader package of $17.4 billion in austerity measures that Greece must put in place in exchange for a $40.6 billion rescue loan. Mr. Stournaras said the troika had asked for clarifications on the measures proposed by the government. ''They asked for details, and we're providing them,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 As Greek officials try to address the financial crisis, citizens try to cope.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDPALO ALTO, Calif.\par \par \uc2 IT'S not as easy being \uc2 Meg Whitman\uc2  as \uc2 Meg Whitman\uc2  might have expected.\par \par \uc2 At 56, Ms. Whitman, the \uc2 eBay\uc2  billionaire who spent a fortune unsuccessfully trying to become the governor of California, has found her Act III. She has been chief executive of Hewlett-Packard for a little more than a year, and many people are still waiting for her to get her message out about the place.\par \par \uc2 Here it is:\par \par \uc2 Meg Whitman\uc2  believes in H.P., and believes that this company matters to Silicon Valley, to California, to the world. She believes that Wall Street doesn't quite get it -- doesn't quite see the promise she sees. She believes that mobile devices, cloud computing and Big Data will re-energize H.P., a company that for a decade has grabbed more headlines for boardroom soap operas than for bold innovation.\par \par \uc2 ''I believe in creative destruction,'' Ms. Whitman says in a conference room near her executive cubicle.\par \par \uc2 Even, it seems, when the stakes include her company and reputation. In all likelihood, this is Ms. Whitman's last great public performance. She became rich by building \uc2 eBay\uc2 , then spent more money than any candidate for public office in the nation's history trying to become California's governor. She was sometimes portrayed in that race as an aloof 1 percenter -- as someone who pushed around subordinates, once literally, and who was unkind to her housekeeper, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . ''I left a little bruised,'' Ms. Whitman, a Republican, says of the 2010 race she lost to Jerry Brown. ''It was hard, it was personally very hard.''\par \par \uc2 So now Ms. Whitman is focusing her energy on H.P., the company founded by the tech legends William Hewlett and David Packard. Bill and Dave, as they are referred to at the company, spawned Silicon Valley. Last year, H.P. posted revenue of $127 billion. It employs 320,000 people directly, and easily that many again through a network of manufacturers and computer resellers across 170 countries.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Whitman has plenty of impressive-sounding stats at her fingertips. H.P., she says, employs thousands of people in Costa Rica, Houston and Boise, Idaho. ''In India, we have 60,000 people,'' she says. A new program for selling printer ink is in exactly 87 countries. Every 15 seconds, the company turns out 60 new printers, 30 personal computers and one powerful computer server. Still, she yearns for even more data, something closer to the command of the day-to-day process she had at \uc2 eBay\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 THE fact is, H.P. isn't what it used to be. Next to Apple or \uc2 Google\uc2 , it looks like a bit of a loser. In the most recent quarter, as Apple soared to new heights, H.P.'s revenue fell 5 percent and its operating margins dwindled. Profit margins at I.B.M. and Apple are several times that of H.P. And H.P.'s share price, at just over $17 on Friday, is about where it was in 1995.\par \par \uc2 ''It's staggering,'' says A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research. ''This is now the cheapest big stock in the last 25 years. That reflects an industry belief that the company is going to decline.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Whitman is impatient to move H.P. closer to a global computing explosion that is transforming the industry. Smartphones and tablets from Apple, \uc2 Google\uc2  and others are now flying into consumers' hands worldwide. Those computers are tied via the Internet to cloud computing data centers operated by Amazon, \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 , and hundreds of multinational companies. Information from all the consumer devices, in addition to data from billions of sensors and Web-crawling robots, is crunched in these supercomputing clouds, creating a Big Data revolution full of business opportunities and dangers.\par \par \uc2 From Ms. Whitman's high vantage, the trends of mobile, cloud and Big Data resolve into a single phenomenon: the creation and exploitation of Information Everywhere. H.P. makes consumer devices, in addition to servers for the cloud, sensor networks, and analysis software. Instead of standing at the confluence of the phenomenon, though, H.P. is on the sidelines, with most of the parts but none of the integration to make it a leader.\par \par \uc2 H.P. sometimes seems like a place of siloed relics, as quaint as the autographed picture of Herbert Hoover in the shrine that is Mr. Packard's office (along with Mr. Hewlett's, untouched since the day Mr. Packard left in 1993). The stock is down 24 percent since Ms. Whitman took over. H.P. spends $4 billion a year on marketing, and, according to an arm of the ad agency WPP, has one of the fastest-eroding brands among major companies.\par \par \uc2 So why did Ms. Whitman take the job? Part of the answer may be in her new slogan for the company: ''Make it matter.'' She plans to unveil her strategy to Wall Street analysts on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 She envisions a more customer-focused, Information-Everywhere H.P., with restyled PCs whose screens break off into iPad-like tablet computers. H.P. will also get into mobile devices, she says. And H.P. printers, under attack from cheap competitors, are being revamped as cloud-connected devices capable of initiating \uc2 Google\uc2 -esque data searches through corporate information. Print cartridges will be sold by subscription, as well as in individual units, with automatic refills shipped when ink runs low.\par \par \uc2 In addition to selling regular computer servers, networking and data storage, H.P. is focusing on cloud-ready ''pods'' of servers, storage and networking, built in three days. Right now a comparable data center can take 18 months to construct.\par \par \uc2 As impressive a portfolio as it is, it's unclear if Wall Street will buy the idea of the company's renewal. Others have equal or greater products, though without H.P.'s broad corporate reach. Ms. Whitman herself is somewhat conflicted: in the same interview, she says that employees and key customers understand the new H.P., but ''I'm not sure the media and Wall Street do.'' Still, she says, H.P. needs four more years ''to have confidence in itself.''\par \par \uc2 The external threats are apparent. New consumer devices eat at H.P.'s PC business, the world's largest. The cloud computing data centers operated by so many companies have some H.P. servers, but those servers have lost ground to shrink-wrapped racks from cheap Asian competitors. The cloud also lowers demand for individual servers, a $10 billion H.P. business. The company also spent that amount last year for Autonomy, a Big Data company that has yet to earn its keep.\par \par \uc2 ''It is a shift bigger than anything in our memory,'' Ms. Whitman says. ''We have to get ahead of the curve.''\par \par \uc2 And H.P. will need to do it, she says, during a period of slack economic growth in Europe, China and the United States.\par \par \uc2 Managing the decline, or, as Ms. Whitman prefers to call it, transformation, of old businesses is a tall order for any executive. At H.P., she has been going for the old Bill-and-Dave touch, standing in line for stir-fry in the cafeteria, hosting video conferences, asking if that seat is taken. She can't talk to everyone, but 10 minutes into a conversation she is apt to lightly touch someone's hand when making a point.\par \par \uc2 ''On Day 1 when she came here, she said, 'Here's the deal: I'm team oriented,' '' says \uc2 David Donatelli\uc2 , the head of H.P.'s server, storage and networking business. Ms. Whitman kicked top executives out of their private offices, and into a warren of cubicles to get them talking. She also replaced people and merged businesses so that the 11-member executive council at the top of H.P. now has just one trained engineer. Counting Ms. Whitman, there are five M.B.A.'s.\par \par \uc2 Many of the company's new products were planned before she took over, but she has added a greater emphasis on software, design and customer focus. Server sales reps are compensated partly on how much software a customer buys, and how much of a customer's total computer budget, including data storage, software and networking H.P. can take.\par \par \uc2 So far, however, the new products don't bring in enough revenue to make up for the eroding older product lines. ''There is nothing wrong with being in charge of a declining business, as long as you are managing it,'' Ms. Whitman says. ''The whole business better not be declining.''\par \par \uc2 TWENTYyears ago, people like \uc2 Steve Ballmer\uc2  at \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 , \uc2 Larry Ellison\uc2  at \uc2 Oracle\uc2 , and \uc2 John Chambers\uc2  at \uc2 Cisco Systems\uc2  heard Kenneth Olsen, then the leader of \uc2 Digital Equipment Corporation\uc2 , deride the PC as unsuited for business. Within a few years, DEC had been gobbled up by \uc2 Compaq Computer\uc2 . Everyone knows viscerally how fast change can overtake a legacy business -- and how hard it is to change.\par \par \uc2 There's little glory in managing decline, particularly in an industry in love with what's next. Apple's tablets are taking share from PC makers like H.P., but only after Apple had a near-death corporate experience that ended with the return of \uc2 Steve Jobs\uc2 . He created a new reality for Apple with its retail stores, something that H.P. can't copy to sell PCs. I.B.M. also transitioned successfully after billions in losses and years of cuts. Most others ended like DEC.\par \par \uc2 Still, Ms. Whitman says her corporate campaign is less brutal than her failed electoral one. She doesn't like to talk about her $140 million-plus run for governor, and says only that it gave her a thicker skin. (At a recent companywide meeting, Ms. Whitman, who helped host a $25,000-a-plate fund-raising visit to Silicon Valley by Paul Ryan, said she would not take a government position if Mitt Romney -- who long ago hired her into the consulting firm \uc2 Bain & Company\uc2  -- is elected president.)\par \par \uc2 The recent legacy dogging H.P. is uniquely bipolar. \uc2 Carly Fiorina\uc2 , who was named chief executive in 1999, tried bringing H.P. somewhat belatedly into the Internet age with a mixture of self-promotion and big corporate acquisitions. She defended her acquisition of \uc2 Compaq\uc2 , only to be ousted amid uneven business execution and a corporate spying scandal.\par \par \uc2 Her successor, \uc2 Mark Hurd\uc2 , deployed hard-nosed, sharp-pencil cost-cutting. He resigned amid accusations of inappropriate conduct with a female contract employee. Like the fate of a totalitarian despot, Mr. Hurd's once-cheered reign is denounced in hindsight, with critics saying his cuts starved H.P. of products and talent. In August, Ms. Whitman wrote off $8 billion of Mr. Hurd's 2008 purchase of the outsourcer \uc2 Electronic Data Systems\uc2  for $13.9 billion, since hoped-for services contracts never materialized.\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Hurd came L\u233\'00\'E9o Apotheker. He talked about new technology but agonized publicly over how H.P. would stay relevant. H.P. stock sank, and, before long, he was out, too.\par \par \uc2 And so H.P.'s board turned to Ms. Whitman.\par \par \uc2 ''She understands customers, business,'' says \uc2 Marc Andreessen\uc2 , the Silicon Valley investor and an H.P. director who helped bring her on board. ''While she's not an engineer, at \uc2 eBay\uc2  she got schooled in how to talk to engineers.'' Besides, he says, there are not a lot of Bill and Daves out there: ''Engineers running companies with 50,000 people or more just aren't available.''\par \par \uc2 Remarkably, the shadow of Bill and Dave still hangs over H.P., for better and for worse. David Scott, who runs the storage business, was at H.P. from 1983 to 2001, then rejoined in 2010 when H.P. bought a company he ran. He has experienced four C.E.O.'s in two years (including an interim chief between Mr. Hurd and Mr. Apotheker) but says that the first day he returned, ''three of the first four people I met were people who were here when I left; there is a tremendous loyalty here.''\par \par \uc2 But employees say H.P. is desperate for leadership after so many changes in the executive suite.\par \par \uc2 ''At our essence, we all want to build a great, enduring company,'' says Mr. Donatelli, the head of the server, storage and networking business. ''I do all-hands meetings where I award people for 40 years, 30 years of service, people who've given their lives here. It's a huge responsibility.''\par \par \uc2 MS. WHITMAN'S efforts to clear out the bad history include a ''bureaucracy buster,'' to register complaints about slow practices, on H.P.'s internal Web site. In the last six months, it garnered 10,000 items, describing problems as varied as overflowing e-mail accounts and lengthy internal procurement rules. Ms. Whitman cannot know, however, if this is even a significant fraction of what is slowing H.P., or whether all its impediments can be addressed.\par \par \uc2 She continues to hold conference calls every couple of weeks with several hundred employees. Recently she derided the fact that H.P. processes insisted on a credit check even for a sale on a customer the size of \uc2 Disney\uc2 . She quickly shut down any talk of selling off the PC business, figuring that H.P. could guarantee cheap supplies by being the world's biggest consumer of things like semiconductors and computer memory. One of her favorite updates involves talking about her top priorities, what she is doing about them and what she needs from her managers.\par \par \uc2 Last spring, in a move to a more consumer-focused business, Mr. Donatelli's job changed from sales of servers to sales to business customers, a consolidation of emphasis that also combined senior managers in every country. \uc2 Todd Bradley\uc2 , who has run the company's PC business, picked up printers as well; that move resulted in the retirement of a well-loved H.P. veteran. H.P. is counting on a spike in PC sales as soon as October, when \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  introduces its new operating system, and Mr. Bradley vows that H.P. will regain its brand.\par \par \uc2 ''Despite the ill-informed commentary that the PC is dead, it is an ever-expanding category,'' he says. Unlike the consumer-focused iPad, he says, PCs are ''devices that are enterprise-ready, with security and Windows 8 compatibility'' that create content for the cloud as readily as they consume it. Since January, Ms. Whitman has doubled the size of Mr. Bradley's PC design team. Now at 60 people, it's still small compared with Apple's.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Whitman's consolidation of top executives was a small part of a companywide layoff of 28,000 people, and even that may pale against what happens next. At a former \uc2 Compaq\uc2  factory in Houston, cloud-computing containers may soon be produced at a rate of 20 a month. At about $25 million apiece, that could mean $6 billion a year in revenue, which is likely equal to the revenue that H.P. will shed in this fiscal year relative to 2011. It takes fewer people to make a cloud-computing pod, however, than an equal number of servers, and pods have profit margins well above H.P.'s average.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm the first C.E.O. in a long time who is from the Valley,'' Ms. Whitman says. ''Carly, Mark and Leo weren't.''\par \par \uc2 She continues: ''I understand the speed you have to move.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: October 7, 2012, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about \uc2 Hewlett-Packard\uc2  referred imprecisely to the circumstances of \uc2 Mark Hurd\uc2 's departure as chief executive in 2010. He resigned amid accusations of inappropriate conduct with a female contract employee, not a female employee of the company.\par \par \uc2 Hewlett-Packard needs four more years ''to have confidence in  itself,'' says Meg Whitman, the company's chief executive.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 From \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's slap at 47 percent of the population that he says mooches off the government to President Obama's heavily mocked quote about businesses that take too much credit for their success, gaffes are all the rage on the presidential campaign trail these days.\par \par \uc2 Invariably we are told these verbal boo-boos are bad enough to bring a presidential campaign to its knees, that somehow the blunder in question has set a new low, a dubious milestone.\par \par \uc2 Two words: \uc2 Rick Perry\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 I am not making light of the fallout from the nominees' recent gaffes. They surely have incurred -- or will incur -- a political cost.\par \par \uc2 The point is that, having covered the Texas governor's botched presidential campaign from mid-August 2011 through mid-January 2012, I have witnessed the birth of a whole new level of faux pas. Think of it as the political equivalent of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Super-Gaffe, if you will.\par \par \uc2 It is not just the magnitude of Perry's face plants that make them so different from what we are seeing out of the Romney and Obama camps. It is the reasons they happened in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Despite the grass-roots enthusiasm and financial support that greeted Perry when he joined the race last year, he was not anywhere near ready for the presidential campaign spotlight. His late entry and lack of debate experience clearly hurt him.\par \par \uc2 What is not widely known is that Perry, 62, had major health issues too -- a serious but previously undiagnosed sleep disorder that was discovered just as the front-runner label was slipping from his hands, and painful sensations in his leg and foot that also kept him up at night.\par \par \uc2 By the time he started sleeping again and feeling better, all of the efforts to right the ship -- like firing his top political adviser and bringing in new hands -- had unleashed so much internal dysfunction that the campaign split into rival factions, made up of people who could not stand to be in the same room together.\par \par \uc2 At this point you may be wondering why anyone would write a book about a presidential candidate who made the word ''oops'' his calling card. The short answer is that ''Oops! A Diary From the 2012 Campaign Trail'' began not as a book but as a diary -- a behind-the-scenes look at life on a modern presidential campaign. The ''embed'' reporters. The bus. The way news is really gathered in the age of Twitter and \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 I had every reason to believe I was covering the eventual Republican nominee when Perry immediately shot to the top of the polls in the summer of 2011. By the time his campaign ground to a halt five months later, the words of the Democratic strategist \uc2 James Carville\uc2 , spoken on CNN in January, seemed like the most apt description of what I had witnessed: ''the worst presidential campaign/candidate in American history.''\par \par \uc2 A Front-Runner Stumbles\par \par \uc2 I like to say that going to a debate is the worst way to actually cover it as a reporter. We don't get anywhere near the studio, where you could, say, gauge the audience reaction.\par \par \uc2 We're stuck in the press filing center, generally a sea of banquet tables with chairs and power strips, with strategically placed televisions all around so you can watch the debate -- only in far worse conditions than the average voter sitting in his living room.\par \par \uc2 I hate Orlando, by the way. It's like Vegas without gambling or scantily clad women. Sprawling hotel complexes. Flip-flop-wearing \uc2 Disney\uc2 -goers. I shudder. But I'll say this: The Fox News-\uc2 Google\uc2  debate there on Sept. 22, 2011 had the best press filing center I've ever been in.\par \par \uc2 The d\u233\'00\'E9cor screamed \uc2 Google\uc2 : multicolored beanbag chairs, plush white wall-to-wall carpet, leather furniture with \uc2 Google\uc2 -colored pillows, modular plastic chairs and plexiglass tables. They had a popcorn machine. A huge smoothie bar. Hamburgers with bacon strips. Pasta. All kinds of drinks and candy. A \uc2 YouTube\uc2  Live Streaming Lounge, inside a big red tent set up inside a room in the cavernous Orlando convention center.\par \par \uc2 Arlette Saenz, a reporter for ABC News, was popping gummy bears and drinking Cokes and hadn't had much sleep, as usual, so she was bouncing off the multicolored walls. We took a seat in view of the smoothie bar. ''This is boring,'' she said about 20 minutes in. I nodded as I polished off my \uc2 Google\uc2  bacon cheeseburger. When political junkies are bored by a presidential debate, you know it's bad. But the fireworks started about 10 minutes later, first on Social Security and then immigration.\par \par \uc2 Under pressure from Romney, Perry delivered a truly awful answer about why he believes so strongly that Texas should let \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  teenagers pay lower in-state tuition rates. In a sort of irritated tone, he said anyone who opposes that policy didn't ''have a heart.'' I thought that was noteworthy, but Twitter told me it was bigger -- monumental -- like his Bernanke ''treasonous'' thing.\par \par \uc2 People were talking about it in the elevators. It was radioactive. And that's not all they talked about in the elevators. Perry suffered some kind of spell onstage when he tried to launch an attack on Romney for being a flip-flopper. He got tongue-tied; incoherent, really.\par \par \uc2 When that happened, Arlette turned to me, dumbfounded. ''Was he like this in Texas?'' she said. All the Perry embeds look to me from time to time to explain the governor. I usually can oblige. Not this time.\par \par \uc2 ''Honey, we're in uncharted waters,'' I said.\par \par \uc2 Arlette quickly transcribed the audio. Watching the video is painful, but seeing the words written out demonstrates the depth of the flub: ''I think Americans just don't know sometimes which \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  they're dealing with. Is it the \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  that was on the side of against the Second Amendment before he was for the Second Amendment? Was it before he was before the social programs from the standpoint of he was for standing up for Roe v. Wade before he was against Roe v. Wade -- he was for Race to the Top -- he's for Obamacare and now he's against it -- I mean we'll wait until tomorrow and see which \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  we're really talking to tonight.''\par \par \uc2 The next day I didn't have to wonder what to write. Just a straight-up reaction piece to Perry's awful performance. The pundit class unloaded. William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, penned a special editorial entitled ''Yikes.'' ''No front-runner in a presidential field has ever, we imagine, had as weak a showing as \uc2 Rick Perry\uc2 ,'' Kristol said. ''It was close to a disqualifying two hours for him.''\par \par \uc2 It feels like the air has gone out of the ''front-runner'' bubble.\par \par \uc2 'Our Guy Isn't Sleeping'\par \par \uc2 Trouble had announced itself in Perry's hotel room on the morning of that Orlando debate.\par \par \uc2 ''I didn't sleep a wink,'' he said to his travel aide, Clint Harp.\par \par \uc2 A Republican Florida state committeewoman, Liliana Ros, was shocked by Perry's apparent physical distress when she greeted him during a commercial break at the debate. ''He grabbed my hand and held on to it,'' Ros told reporters. ''His hand was so cold, like ice. And he was sweating. I don't know what it was, but something was definitely wrong.''\par \par \uc2 It showed onstage. Toward the end of the debate, Perry had scrawled down on a sheet of paper an attack line he wanted to use against the ever-waffling \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 . But then he proceeded to botch it, turning his rambling answer into a late-night comedian's dream.\par \par \uc2 Back at headquarters in Austin, Perry's health -- his severe lack of sleep, mainly -- became a central focus. ''Our guy's not sleeping,'' Dave Carney said in the office in a brainstorming session about the governor's condition.\par \par \uc2 Perry had kept in touch with his medical team, and by early October, days after the Florida fiasco, he had urgently consulted sleep specialists. After conducting overnight tests on Perry, they produced a rather startling diagnosis: He had sleep apnea, and it had gone undetected for years, probably decades. The ailment, which affects one in 10 men worldwide and becomes more common as people age, causes loud snoring and temporary lapses in breathing that disrupt normal sleep.\par \par \uc2 After the diagnosis, doctors prescribed for Perry a machine known as a CPAP -- short for continuous positive airway pressure -- which exerts air into the nose and mouth through a plastic mask to ensure constant breathing.\par \par \uc2 Perry, almost unreasonably fit for his age, had considered himself a light sleeper his entire adult life. He also was an obsessive exercise nut. It's how he kept some balance in an otherwise stressful life.\par \par \uc2 The way he told it later, all that rigorous physical activity over the year had kept his sleep apnea in check. Then back surgery he underwent in July 2011 sidelined him, kept him out of the gym, and he went from light sleeper to insomniac.\par \par \uc2 ''Once he got to exercising again, I think he had more energy and started to get back into the swing of things, but by then it was too late,'' a top campaign aide said. ''The narrative had already been set. He was becoming an afterthought.''\par \par \uc2 Jay Root is the author of ''Oops! A Diary From the 2012 Campaign Trail,'' from which this article is adapted. It will be published by Byliner on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ERIC THAYER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES; CHIP SOMODEVILLA/GETTY IMAGES)   \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120923e89n0009g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The White House has ruled that young immigrants who will be allowed to stay in the United States as part of a new federal policy will not be eligible for health insurance coverage under President Obama's health care overhaul.\par \par \uc2 The decision -- disclosed last month, to little notice -- has infuriated many advocates for Hispanic Americans and immigrants. They say the restrictions are at odds with Mr. Obama's recent praise of the young immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In June, the president announced that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children, attended school here and met other requirements would be allowed to remain in the country without fear of deportation.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants granted such relief would ordinarily meet the definition of ''lawfully present'' residents, making them eligible for government subsidies to buy private insurance, a central part of the new health care law. But the administration issued a rule in late August that specifically excluded the young immigrants from the definition of ''lawfully present.''\par \par \uc2 At the same time, in a letter to state health officials, the administration said that young immigrants granted a reprieve from deportation ''shall not be eligible'' for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Administration officials said they viewed the immigration initiative and health coverage as separate matters.\par \par \uc2 Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said in the Federal Register that the reasons offered for the immigration initiative ''do not pertain to eligibility for Medicaid,'' the children's health program or federal subsidies for buying private health insurance.\par \par \uc2 Nick Papas, a White House spokesman, said the deferred-deportation policy ''was never intended'' to confer eligibility for federal health benefits. The White House describes that policy as ''an exercise of prosecutorial discretion,'' allowing law enforcement officers to focus on immigrants who pose a threat to national security or public safety. Administration officials declined to elaborate as to why beneficiaries of the new immigration policy were ineligible for coverage under the new health law.\par \par \uc2 The move might help Mr. Obama avoid a heated political debate over whether the health law is benefiting illegal immigrants. The possibility of such benefits has drawn criticism from many Republicans, including Representative \uc2 Joe Wilson\uc2  of South Carolina, who shouted ''You lie!'' as Mr. Obama addressed the issue before a joint session of Congress in 2009.\par \par \uc2 The restrictions on health coverage may also save money by limiting the number of people who receive health insurance wholly or partly from the federal government. Federal subsidies for insurance under the new health care law are expected to average $5,300 a year for each person subsidized in 2014, and the cost is expected to rise to $7,500 a person in 2022, the Congressional Budget Office says.\par \par \uc2 Several immigration lawyers and health policy experts have criticized the restrictions, saying they will make it more difficult to achieve the goals of the health law and the immigration initiative, which Democrats consider two of Mr. Obama's most significant achievements.\par \par \uc2 Jennifer M. Ng'andu, a health policy specialist at the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic rights group, said: ''We do not understand why the administration decided to do this. It's providing immigration relief to children and young adults so they can be fully integrated into society. At the same time, it's shutting them out of the health care system so they cannot become productive members of society.''\par \par \uc2 Ricardo E. Campos, 23, of Wheaton, Md., an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who came to the United States from El Salvador at the age of 12, applied for the deferred-enforcement program two weeks ago with help from a community organization, Casa de Maryland.\par \par \uc2 He is attending a community college and said he desperately needs affordable health insurance. After doctors discovered that he had bone cancer, he underwent a 36-hour operation in 2009 and was in a wheelchair for a year.\par \par \uc2 ''I want to become a doctor, in internal medicine or oncology, so I can save lives just as my life was saved,'' Mr. Campos said.\par \par \uc2 ''What if one day the cancer comes back and I don't have health insurance? That's scary.'' (Just before his surgery, Mr. Campos got coverage through a state-sponsored plan with high premiums, after commercial insurers had turned him down.)\par \par \uc2 Under the new federal health law, insurance subsidies are available not only to citizens, but also to low-income immigrants ''lawfully present'' in the United States. That group will still include green card holders and people granted asylum.\par \par \uc2 The Pew Research Center estimates that up to 1.7 million unauthorized immigrants could eventually seek deferrals of deportation under the exercise of executive authority announced in June by Mr. Obama. Those immigrants will continue to be able to receive health insurance from employers, but many are likely to struggle to obtain coverage if they do not have a job that provides it.\par \par \uc2 In the absence of a significant change in immigration law, young immigrants granted temporary relief from deportation have no clear path to green cards or citizenship.\par \par \uc2 When he announced the new immigration policy in June, Mr. Obama hailed the patriotism and promise of young ''dreamers'' -- illegal immigrants who could have gained legal status under a bill known as the Dream Act, which has been bottled up in Congress for 11 years. Mr. Obama said the young immigrants were Americans at heart and should be able to work legally and live openly in this country without fear of being expelled.\par \par \uc2 Marielena Hincapi\u233\'00\'E9, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group for low-income immigrants, said: ''We had been working closely with the administration, so we were quite surprised and shocked by the new restrictions on health coverage. This is a shortsighted, reactionary and bad public policy.''\par \par \uc2 Republicans in Congress have criticized the deportation deferrals as a form of backdoor amnesty for immigrants who broke the law by entering the United States illegally or by overstaying visas. They say Mr. Obama does not have the legal authority to do what he did -- a claim also made in a lawsuit by 10 immigration law enforcement officers who are challenging the policy in Federal District Court.\par \par \uc2 The politics of the issue cut in several directions. The Gallup tracking poll shows Mr. Obama with a wide lead over his Republican opponent, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , among Hispanic voters. At the same time, administration officials have tried to avoid alienating swing voters who are concerned about illegal immigration, and they have emphasized steps taken to secure the borders.\par \par \uc2 In the primary campaign, Mr. Romney said he would veto the Dream Act because it could create a magnet for illegal immigration. Ryan M. Williams, a spokesman for Mr. Romney, said Mr. Obama's deferred-deportation policy had ''ruined an effort in Congress to forge a bipartisan long-term solution'' for illegal immigrants brought here as children.\par \par \uc2 Some immigrants and their allies worry that the restrictions on federal health benefits could be used to justify similar actions by state officials. Gov. \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2  of Arizona, a Republican, has issued an executive order denying driver's licenses and public benefits to young immigrants who are granted relief from deportation.\par \par \uc2 Jennifer M. Ng'andu, a health policy specialist at the National Council of La Raza, and Ricardo E.  Campos, 23, a student in Maryland, are dismayed at the White House's decision on health care.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In ''Divided by Immigration Policy,'' on the cover of last Sunday's Metropolitan section, John Leland profiled friends and families split by President Obama's recent executive order that gave some illegal immigrants who came to the country before age 16 the chance to avoid deportation for two years. Commenters on NYTimes.com debated the policy and whether illegal immigrants deserved sympathy. Readers also discussed Ginia Bellafante's Big City column, which questioned whether increased charitable giving could replace cuts to government social services, as some Republican have argued. A selection of comments is below.\par \par \uc2 Sad stories, but surely these people, who were mostly teenagers when they came here, understood the concept of ''illegal'' before they got here. They came anyway and now expect us to ignore our laws. There are 23 million Americans unemployed or underemployed; we simply can't provide for the entire world. We need to reduce even legal immigration and deport all illegal aliens that we can find. We just can't afford to be so lackadaisical in enforcing our laws: Our own people need those jobs.\par \par \uc2 Chakotay,\par \par \uc2 Texas\par \par \uc2 It is understandable that Americans are wary of more immigrants in the U.S. job market. But, honestly, if you're unemployed, what job did you apply for that an immigrant ''stole'' from you or a family member? Just list one example. Please remember that economic migrants would not come to the U.S. if they were not being hired. Perhaps the scapegoats for your angry rants should be U.S. employers, instead.\par \par \uc2 K,\par \par \uc2 TX\par \par \uc2 You've hit the nail on the head. Very few people reading the \uc2 NYT\uc2  online have probably lost a job to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Unfortunately, that doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist. It's just that it exists among those most \uc2 NYT\uc2  readers are probably not familiar with.\par \par \uc2 People with high-school diplomas who used to do construction -- union construction -- for example. It is now pretty much impossible for someone paying union wages to submit a winning bid in the U.S. Almost all are predicated on the use of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor.\par \par \uc2 Siobhan,\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 You call them illegals, but this group came when they were minors at the behest of responsible adults. Also this concept of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is fairly new. It is clear to me that rigid immigration rules with no hope for earning citizenship just create more inequality -- i.e. creating an underclass. This hurts all of us. I think it is very appropriate -- and very American -- to push against that injustice and that these young people are very American already.\par \par \uc2 Abbit,\par \par \uc2 nyc\par \par \uc2 The Limits of Charity\par \par \uc2 We need to redefine charitable donation. Charity is giving without the expectation of some kind of return to someone in need. Philanthropy is giving to institutions that promote excellence and culture. Giving to your church is supporting your faith, tithing.\par \par \uc2 This is why we cannot abdicate the safety net to the kindness of strangers. It is not sustainable. People need food every day, they need health care, they need shelter. It is not a fashion, a mood, or a whim for a socialite who lacks basic empathy and is driven by ego.\par \par \uc2 I work with a social-service organization, and we will need to increase our donations by about 12 percent per year to sustain our costs and the increased demand. Yet, the old people who gave to groups like us because this is what you did are dying. We now have to compete with the fashionable charities and we have to sell ourselves as an investment.\par \par \uc2 It is imperative to sustain the safety net. This is a crisis. The dystopia is here, it is not some indie film.\par \par \uc2 Stellaa,\par \par \uc2 Santa Rosa, Ca\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, government social services are out of control, with grants in the form of welfare, food stamps, WIC, housing, etc., going to able-bodied people who did not want to work even when jobs were available, who have babies for the income and perks, and file millions of false disability claims. I am quite happy to have people give to charitable causes. I feel incredibly ripped-off by many of the people that the government supports.\par \par \uc2 California doctor,\par \par \uc2 California\par \par \uc2 As a middle-class taxpayer, I resent having to take up the slack caused by the wealthy's ''charitable'' deductions for their gifts to their universities, art leagues and velodromes on public park lands where I used to go picnicking. I can't afford to send my kids to their university, attend the gala opening of the museum's newly acquired collection in its newly constructed wing, and the Schwinn I bought at Sears eight years ago doesn't ''fit'' well at the velodrome. I guess I'd rather see the truly public services, facilities or assistance that taxes on these ''charitable deductions'' should have bought. To do that, the law will have to be changed, but guess who ''owns'' the lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 Bob Walton,\par \par \uc2 Severn, MD\par \par \uc2 For those of us who work in social services, there definitely is a feeling of disappointment when we see large amounts of ''charitable'' giving going to institutions of great wealth, like many museums and universities. But it is hard to criticize those who are willingly giving away their own money to causes they believe in.\par \par \uc2 David Nocenti,\par \par \uc2 New York, New York\par \par \uc2 The nonprofit sector in the U.S. is unique in its size and reach. It historically funds and runs all manner of programs that are almost entirely funded by government in most other countries. Their Yale Universities, their museums and their social-service programs are almost entirely funded by government. The amount of contributions going to activities that help the less fortunate is substantial.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Independent,\par \par \uc2 CT\par \par \uc2 DREAM ACT: Alex Cruz, 18, entered the United States illegally.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTMB\par {\*\bkmkstart toc25}{\*\bkmkend toc25}\b \uc2 Divided by Immigration Policy\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN LELAND   \par \uc2 3,116 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 September 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDTHE outpouring was intense this summer when President Obama announced that his administration would temporarily stop deporting many illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children. On Aug. 15, thousands of young immigrants flooded churches and community centers to apply for deferral.\par \par \uc2 Then, for many, came the hard news that they were not eligible.\par \par \uc2 Now, friends, siblings and spouses who for years shared the same precarious status find themselves on opposite sides of a divide, one preparing for lawful work or access to student loans, the other bracing for the tap of an immigration official.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama ordered the policy change using his executive authority, after legislation he supported known as the Dream Act -- which would have given legal status to young immigrants -- stalled in Congress. The new policy applies to immigrants 30 and under who came to the United States before they turned 16, and who meet other conditions; it allows them to work and avoid deportation for two years, but with no green cards or path to citizenship. As many as 1.7 million people could be eligible, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research organization; another 2.7 million illegal immigrants age 30 and under are not covered.\par \par \uc2 In some cases, the difference between being eligible for work or deportation is just a couple of months.\par \par \uc2 That difference divides people like Nelly and Alex Cruz, siblings who came from Honduras six years ago without their parents. Mr. Cruz, who was 12 then, may now be able to begin a new life, free from the fears that have hung over him; but his sister was 18 when they came. For Ms. Cruz, who has been under a final order of removal since 2010, the threat is real -- in its first three years, the Obama administration deported 1.1 million illegal immigrants, more than any presidential administration since the 1950s.\par \par \uc2 It also divides Boni and Gilda, a married couple who are raising their son, David, in East Harlem. Boni, who is 28, is eligible; but Gilda is 32, which makes her two years too old for deferral. She is afraid of being deported -- picked up in a raid and separated from her son or husband. The couple asked to be identified only by their first names for fear of calling attention to her status.\par \par \uc2 And Yohan Garcia and Monica Sibri, college students who met as volunteers in Mayor \uc2 Michael R. Bloomberg\uc2 's office. After graduation, Mr. Garcia, who is eligible for deferred action, wants to go into politics; but Ms. Sibri, who came from Ecuador two months after her 16th birthday, said she would have to leave the country ''because there's nothing else I can do without my papers.''\par \par \uc2 All six had stories about life as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and the changes that the new policy will or will not make in their lives. Mr. Garcia said he began his journey in this country with a gun pointed at his head; the Cruz siblings said they began theirs in the custody of border patrols in Texas. None has any certainty about how long the reprieve, which is hotly contested by many Republicans, might last.\par \par \uc2 The Siblings\par \par \uc2 The first hurdle, said Alex Cruz, 18, was getting here. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Cruz unwound after work in the small walk-up apartment in Borough Park, Brooklyn, that he shares with his sister Nelly, her boyfriend, the couple's 2-month-old baby and the boyfriend's brother. A mattress was tipped on its side to create space for a living room. Ms. Cruz, 24, dandled the baby, Brandon, and offered juice. She looked sleepless. The elevated D train rumbled by.\par \par \uc2 Six years ago, when street gangs and a lack of opportunity drove the siblings out of Choluteca, Honduras, they boarded a series of buses that took them through Mexico to the Rio Grande, she said. All through Mexico, Ms. Cruz feared she might be raped; it had happened to friends who had crossed illegally, she said. ''We just kind of made our way,'' Mr. Cruz said. At the border, they said, they joined a large group to swim across the river, carrying only what they could hold in their pockets.\par \par \uc2 Almost immediately after they emerged from the river, they were picked up by the United States Border Patrol and taken to a holding facility in Hidalgo, Tex. -- cold and terrified in an unfamiliar country where they did not speak the language, they said.\par \par \uc2 ''It was worse than being in jail,'' Ms. Cruz said in Spanish, her brother acting as interpreter. ''You couldn't tell if it was day or night. The space was little, and it was cold. People entered and left, kids, women. They say that this country is for opportunities, but in reality, you find your own opportunities. It's really hard.''\par \par \uc2 Border agents bused some of the Mexicans back across the border immediately, they said. But for the Cruz siblings, the agents began formal removal proceedings, assigned them a court date and allowed them to continue by bus to New York, where their mother was living legally as an immigrant of temporary protected status, which allowed her to work but not to sponsor family members.\par \par \uc2 She sent them to a man they knew only as Father Bob, who helped them petition for asylum. From 2006 to 2010, Father Bob -- Robert Vitaglione, a driven priest who represented tens of thousands of immigrants in court, acting in lieu of a lawyer, until the court barred him last year because of some glaring mistakes -- pleaded their case, but in 2010, the court ordered them to be deported. They were buying time, but it was running out.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, their mother moved them to Goshen, Ind., where she had found a job in a factory. Mr. Cruz went to high school and made new friends, but as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , he felt a distance between himself and his classmates. ''You start to see that you don't have papers in high school,'' he said. ''Most of your friends get their drivers' licenses, and I didn't. They start getting jobs, and I didn't.''\par \par \uc2 For the first time, the siblings split up. Ms. Cruz, who was too old for high school, returned to New York, where work was easier without papers, and got a job in a recycling center for cellphone parts, earning $5 or $6 an hour, below minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 ''They take advantage of us because we are Latinos,'' she said, meaning because they are illegal immigrants. When Mr. Cruz finished high school this spring, he returned to New York to join his sister. He, too, wanted to work, and that was not possible in Goshen.\par \par \uc2 Had they been legal, he said, they would have all stayed together in Indiana, where the cost of living is lower. But he needed to earn money for college. In Brooklyn, he found work delivering fish, at $10 an hour.\par \par \uc2 When he heard about Mr. Obama's program, he said, he was both surprised and ecstatic. The program expands an earlier order to allow what is called prosecutorial discretion for illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes, and to focus ''resources on individuals who pose a danger to national security or a risk to public safety, including immigrants convicted of crimes, recent border crossers and repeat immigration law offenders,'' said Peter Boogaard, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department. Such discretion does not include a work permit, however. For Mr. Cruz, the deferral means a chance to continue his education, an opportunity that no one in his family has had, he said. ''I will quit my job, apply for a loan and go to college.'' One study, by the \uc2 New York Immigration Coalition\uc2 , an immigrant advocacy group, found that a legal work permit increases income by about 40 percent.\par \par \uc2 But as the program's details came out, the siblings realized that Ms. Cruz was not eligible. For her, the policy offers no protection.\par \par \uc2 Their situation is common, said Allan Wernick, director of Citizenship Now!, an immigrant legal assistance program at the \uc2 City University of New York\uc2 . ''Everybody who is eligible knows someone who isn't, whether a friend or a family member,'' he said. ''We're getting a lot of inquiries from people hoping it's flexible, but it's not flexible.''\par \par \uc2 Now, Ms. Cruz said, they might be split up again, this time through the president's program. When her brother gets papers, she said, she will be the only one without them, and living under a deportation order.\par \par \uc2 ''When the day comes that Immigration comes to find me, I won't know what to do with my kid, to leave him or take him,'' she said. ''He was born here. It's not his fault that his mother is an immigrant.'' Her boyfriend, who came illegally from Mexico at age 18, is in the same situation.\par \par \uc2 A senior immigration official said her defiance of the final removal order would weigh against her in consideration of prosecutorial discretion, but that her child would be considered a factor in her favor, because deporting her would cause a hardship to an American citizen. The uncertainty worried her.\par \par \uc2 ''Before, I had a lot of dreams, but now I don't know,'' she said. ''Before, I would like to become a teacher or a stockbroker. Before, I didn't know how the system works in this country, but now that I know, it's really hard. Those were just my dreams.''\par \par \uc2 If she were deported, would her brother follow her back to Honduras? He thought about it. ''No,'' he said, sheepishly. ''There's nothing there. But I would help her.''\par \par \uc2 She turned to him. ''At least for two years he will be safe,'' she said. ''But not me.''\par \par \uc2 The Friends\par \par \uc2 They met at the Mayor's Office of Adult Education, volunteering because they were ineligible for paid internships or jobs. Neither knew the other's immigration status. ''I never wanted to ask Monica,'' said Yohan Garcia, 25, ''but I was guessing she was one.''\par \par \uc2 For Monica Sibri, 20, immigration status was never something she talked about. ''I didn't think it was necessary,'' she said. Then one day, some of her friends started saying that illegal immigrants did not belong here, she said. Ms. Sibri listened but did not say anything at first, absorbing her friends' comments like a blow. ''I realized this was something that was keeping us apart,'' she said. ''I opened myself to them. I said, 'Listen, this is me.' ''\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mayor Bloomberg said that by executive order, city employees do not ask people about their immigration status. Volunteer work does not require work authorization.\par \par \uc2 The two friends are alike in many ways: They are ambitious, serious and drawn to political discussions on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . Both are in college, studying political science -- Mr. Garcia at Hunter College, Ms. Sibri at the College of Staten Island. Mr. Garcia came from Mexico at 15, through what he said was a harrowing seven-day hike across the Arizona desert, during which his group was robbed at gunpoint. Ms. Sibri said she was 16, and still a sheltered private-school student, when she came from Ecuador in a crossing that she described as ''like a vacation for us.'' Both struggled to learn English. Both thought they were the only person they knew without papers.\par \par \uc2 But the difference in their ages when they immigrated -- he at 15, she at 16 -- means a sharp distinction in the way they approach their futures now.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Sibri first heard about the president's deferred-action program through Mr. Garcia, who wrote about it on his \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page. They started asking each other questions, mainly about immigration policy. She was thrilled by the news. She was volunteering at both the mayor's office and a pharmacy, while her parents paid for her education -- her mother by cleaning houses, her father by working in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant. With work authorization under the program, she could contribute to the family expenses.\par \par \uc2 ''The first thing I did was tell my parents about it,'' she said. ''They were excited. Then we realized it didn't apply.'' She had entered the United States too late. The news was crushing, she said. ''Sometimes the only thing that relieves the pain is to cry.''\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Garcia, who is still gathering documents for his application, the new law may allow him to pursue jobs now closed to him, he said. He had gotten offers from the mayor's office, the labor union Local 32BJ and City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, but had to decline them all because of his status. Instead, he worked the overnight shift at a 24-hour bagel shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\par \par \uc2 ''When I got offered a job at 32BJ and couldn't take it because of my immigration status, I felt like crying,'' he said. ''I thought, no matter what I do, I was never going to get one of these job opportunities. Even though you were volunteering, giving your time, the city or the state or the country wasn't giving you anything back. You were just a number on the side that didn't count.'' But now, he said, all that has changed. ''Deferred action is going to make us feel we're a part of society.''\par \par \uc2 For Ms. Sibri, though, the law's limits seemed arbitrary.\par \par \uc2 ''A politician on the news said the people who come after they turn 16 are capable of understanding what they're doing. I didn't know. That little detail about the age really bothers me.''\par \par \uc2 The painful part, she said, comes when she thinks about life after graduation. Without a deferral, she will not be eligible for lawful work. So she has come to a hard decision. Her only future, she said, was to return to Ecuador.\par \par \uc2 ''I told my parents, and they're absolutely not happy about it,'' she said. ''They spent a lot of money thinking they're going to give me a better future here. I'm really scared of what I'm going to do over there, because I'll be starting at zero.''\par \par \uc2 The Married Couple\par \par \uc2 Boni and Gilda came to New York separately from the same town in Puebla, Mexico. When they met again at a party here, she was surprised, Gilda said. Boni, four years her junior, had been so young the last time she saw him back in Puebla. On a recent morning, in the office of a neighbor from East Harlem, she laughed thinking of their first meeting. ''I remembered him much smaller,'' she said through an interpreter.\par \par \uc2 He worked in a restaurant kitchen; she worked at a jewelry factory. They started dating and married, and she gave birth to their son, David, six years ago. In recent years, Boni has started paying taxes, in hopes that some form of amnesty will become available.\par \par \uc2 They spoke uneasily of their status under the new policy.\par \par \uc2 When it was first announced, both thought they were ineligible. Gilda, 32, was too old; Boni did not think he had the proper documents -- a common problem for many immigrants, especially from rural areas, said \uc2 Chung-Wha Hong\uc2 , executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. She added, ''We're hearing more and more about scammers trying to take advantage of these people,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 A neighbor who works at the coalition told Boni how he could apply using affidavits to prove his dates of residence.\par \par \uc2 ''It's going to open a lot of doors,'' he said. ''I always wanted to open a business, but because of the papers situation, I always think I'm not going to be able to do it. But if I qualify and can get this, it's going to be more easy for me to one day open a business or start going back to school, apply for some financial aid. Or prepare for something in life.''\par \par \uc2 In Mexico, he had stopped his education after middle school, when school was no longer free. In New York, he finished high school but could not afford college. Now, he said, that might be possible.\par \par \uc2 ''We both wish we could be eligible for deferred action,'' he said. ''One of us is living in fear; we're still in fear that we'll be separated.''\par \par \uc2 For Gilda, all focus now is on raising her son. David plays soccer and takes swimming lessons, and recently took a test to qualify for gifted and talented programs, missing by three points. ''We'll try again,'' Boni said.\par \par \uc2 ''I am afraid of being separated, hearing about raids, in case there's a raid in the workplace,'' Gilda said. ''I think about my child, and what it would be for us to get separated. Or what if they get me while I'm with my child? My husband says not to worry, but it's something I'm afraid of.''\par \par \uc2 And if Gilda is arrested by immigration officers, what would they do then? It was too much to think about, she said.\par \par \uc2 ''We haven't had that conversation,'' she said. ''It's a scary thing.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: September 16, 2012, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, a picture caption last Sunday with an article about friends and families divided by changes to immigration policy misstated, in some editions, the age at which one man illegally entered the United States. As the article correctly noted, the man, Alex Cruz, entered the country six years ago; he did not immigrate at 18, his current age.\par \par \uc2 POLICY SHIFT:  After the Dream Act  stalled in Congress,  President Obama  issued an executive  order giving some  immigrants the  chance to work and  avoid deportation  for two years. The  policy, which applies  to those who entered  the country before  the age of 16, has divided  some families.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc26}{\*\bkmkend toc26}\b \uc2 Court Rulings Help Illegal Immigrants' College-Bound Children\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON   \par \uc2 778 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 September 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Several states with financial difficulties have moved quietly in recent years to reduce spending on college education by denying low tuition rates and financial aid to American citizens who are the children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But in separate decisions over the past month, courts in New Jersey and Florida have rebuffed those efforts, adding new limits to the measures state officials can take to crack down on illegal immigrants by denying benefits to them and their families.\par \par \uc2 The latest ruling came on Friday from a federal court in Florida, which threw out state regulations defining American children of parents without legal immigration status as out-of-state residents, ineligible for tuition breaks given to state residents at public colleges and universities. Tuition for out-of-state students can be as much as three times as high as the rate for residents.\par \par \uc2 The five students who brought the lawsuit against Florida education officials were born in this country. They had been living in Florida for most or all of their lives and had graduated from public high schools there.\par \par \uc2 One student, Noel Saucedo, was born in Florida in 1991 and graduated from a high school there in 2010. But according to the suit, he was not even able to complete his application to \uc2 Florida International University\uc2 , one of the leading four-year schools in the state system, because he could not provide proof that his parents were legal residents of the United States.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Saucedo was offered a full scholarship to \uc2 Miami Dade College\uc2 , a two-year school, the lawsuit said. But when he could not show that his parents had legal immigration status, he was deemed to be an out-of-state resident. His scholarship was reduced and his tuition was raised, so he could not afford to go to college full time.\par \par \uc2 Florida's regulations were adopted in 2010 and 2011, with the most recent coming under Gov. \uc2 Rick Scott\uc2 , a Republican who took office in January of last year.\par \par \uc2 In a broad decision, Judge K. Michael Moore of Federal District Court in Miami found the regulations unconstitutional because they ''create a second-tier status of U.S. citizenship,'' by denying benefits to the students in the lawsuit that were freely available to other Americans.\par \par \uc2 The policy ''does not advance any legitimate state interest,'' the judge wrote, while it hindered Florida's goal of ''furthering educational opportunities for its own residents.'' The lawsuit was brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.\par \par \uc2 Policies to deny college assistance to American children of \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  parents build on efforts by many states to deny aid to immigrant students who themselves are here illegally. But they have attracted far less attention than other state immigration laws, even though they affect thousands of Americans in Florida alone.\par \par \uc2 ''Legally, the issue is straightforward,'' said Michael A. Olivas, a professor of immigration and education law at the University of Houston. ''These children are citizens. These are not kids whose status is at issue at all. The provisions are struck down on plain vanilla equal-protection grounds.''\par \par \uc2 Lawyers said many American students had been reluctant to challenge the policies for fear of exposing their parents to the possibility of deportation.\par \par \uc2 That was the situation of an American student, now 18, who brought a challenge anonymously, under the initials A. Z., to financial aid laws in New Jersey. A. Z. had been living in the state with her mother, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Guatemala, since 1997. After graduating from high school with honors, she was accepted at a four-year state college, according to Alexander Shalom, a lawyer for the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  who helped bring the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 A. Z. applied for state financial aid based on her mother's yearly income of $4,950. Her application was denied by New Jersey education officials ''because your parents are not legal residents,'' they wrote, under a policy put in effect in 2005.\par \par \uc2 In a ruling on Aug. 8, a New Jersey state appeals court rejected that decision. ''She is a citizen,'' three justices found, adding that the record clearly showed that A. Z. had also shown ''lengthy and continuous residence'' in New Jersey.\par \par \uc2 ''Here is a citizen being denied rights and privileges because of who her parent is,'' Mr. Shalom said. ''We think that's decidedly un-American.'' She plans to reapply for the aid next year, he said.\par \par \uc2 In California, state officials agreed in 2007 to settle a similar lawsuit, putting an end to policies there that denied residency to American students with parents in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120906e8960005w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HARLINGEN, Tex. -- The judge called his next case, scanning the courtroom.\par \par \uc2 The immigrant who was facing deportation rose to his feet, in a clean T-shirt and khaki pants several sizes too large, with his name -- JUAN -- printed on a tag around his neck.\par \par \uc2 But the judge could not see him. Juan's head did not rise above the court's wooden benches.\par \par \uc2 Juan David Gonzalez was 6 years old. He was in the court, which would decide whether to expel him from the country, without a parent -- and also without a lawyer.\par \par \uc2 Immigration courts in this South Texas border town and across the country are confronting an unexpected surge of children, some of them barely school age, who traveled here without parents and were caught as they tried to cross illegally into the United States.\par \par \uc2 The young people, mostly from Mexico and Central America, ride to the border on the roofs of freight trains or the backs of buses. They cross the Rio Grande on inner tubes, or hike for days through extremes of heat and chill in Arizona deserts. The smallest children, like Juan, are most often brought by smugglers.\par \par \uc2 The youths pose troubling difficulties for American immigration courts. Unlike in criminal or family courts, in immigration court there is no right to a lawyer paid by the government for people who cannot afford one. And immigration law contains few protections specifically for minors. So even a child as young as Juan has to go before an immigration judge -- confronting a prosecutor and trying to fight deportation -- without the help of a lawyer, if one is not privately provided.\par \par \uc2 So far this year, more than 11,000 unaccompanied minors have been placed in deportation proceedings, nearly double last year's numbers.\par \par \uc2 Young migrants say they are fleeing sharply escalating criminal violence in their home countries. Federal agencies have scrambled to muster adequate detention facilities, while legal groups try to find lawyers to represent them. Judges, for their part, have struggled to offer fair hearings to penniless youths who speak little English and often do not even understand why they are in court.\par \par \uc2 The influx has heightened concerns that young people without legal help may not be able to obtain even the most basic justice.\par \par \uc2 ''It is almost impossible for children to receive relief in immigration court on their own,'' said Meredith Linsky, the director of the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum Representation Project, known as ProBAR, a nonprofit organization that defends young migrants in the region. ''The reality is they cannot comprehend the system and what is being asked of them.''\par \par \uc2 Juan David Gonzalez was just another illegal border crosser on Judge Howard E. Achtsam's docket one recent day. Juan was guided to the front of the courtroom by a social worker so that the judge could see him. Like any adult, Juan was facing charges of entering the United States without authorization, punishable by removal.\par \par \uc2 Speaking through an interpreter, Judge Achtsam delicately asked the boy his name and age. After the social worker's nudge, Juan declared them loudly. She informed the court of plans by a federal child welfare agency to send Juan to be reunited with his parents, who were illegal immigrants living in another state.\par \par \uc2 Judge Achtsam postponed Juan's proceedings, but he warned the boy and other minors in the courtroom.\par \par \uc2 ''If you do not have a lawyer,'' the judge said, ''you need to be ready to speak for yourselves at your next hearing.''\par \par \uc2 Juan left holding the social worker's hand, grinning proudly when she told him he had done well. But his case was just beginning. Most likely it would end with a final order for his deportation.\par \par \uc2 A Risk Worth Taking\par \par \uc2 The rush of young illegal border crossers began last fall but picked up speed this year, according to official figures. From October through July, the authorities detained 21,842 unaccompanied minors, most at the Southwest border, a 48 percent increase over a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 Some left their parents behind at home. Many came yearning to reunite with parents who have long been living here illegally.\par \par \uc2 The figures are striking because overall migration from Latin America, especially from Mexico, fell last year to the lowest level in two decades, according to the \uc2 Pew Hispanic Center\uc2 , a research group in Washington. Yet the numbers of young unaccompanied Mexicans crossing illegally have stayed steady, and minors from Central America -- especially El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras -- have nearly doubled since last year.\par \par \uc2 Policy changes in this country or Mexico do not appear to have spurred the surge.\par \par \uc2 President Obama's announcement in June that he would halt deportations of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students came months after the increases were first seen. From the start, officials made it clear that no recent border crossers would be eligible.\par \par \uc2 Recent illegal crossers are also excluded from an Obama administration policy applying prosecutorial discretion to spare illegal immigrants from deportation if they have not been convicted of crimes.\par \par \uc2 Nor has there been any effect from a recent change in Mexican law that would make it easier for young migrants from Central America to cross Mexico on their way to the United States. That law has not yet been put into practice, Mexican officials said.\par \par \uc2 Some answers came from the \uc2 Women's Refugee Commission\uc2 , an advocacy group in New York, which interviewed more than 150 young migrants in Texas in June. Most said they were seeking to escape increasingly violent gangs and drug traffickers at home, who were recruiting children aggressively.\par \par \uc2 ''They are willing to risk the uncertain dangers of the trip north to escape certain dangers they face at home,'' said Jessica Jones, a member of the commission's fact-finding team.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes parents living illegally in this country will initiate a child's journey. Tighter border enforcement under the Obama administration has made them reluctant to leave, fearing that they will not be able to return. Instead, they hire smugglers, paying up to $5,000 per child.\par \par \uc2 ''The children at home feel unloved, they feel empty,'' said Elizabeth G. Kennedy, a researcher at San Diego State University who studies child migrants. ''If parents know their child is feeling empty and is in danger, they will make a decision.''\par \par \uc2 For the parents of Liliana Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz, 6, it was a bloody spree of shootouts and kidnappings by drug traffickers close to her home in Tamaulipas, in northeast Mexico, that prompted them to send for their daughter. Both illegal immigrants, they had been living near Atlanta since 2007.\par \par \uc2 They had steady jobs, he in landscaping and she in a restaurant, and regularly wired money to an aunt in Mexico who was raising Liliana.\par \par \uc2 ''But we knew what she needed was not the money, not the clothes,'' Mrs. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz said in Spanish. ''She needed the attention and care of her parents.'' (Although their daughter's name is now in the public record, the parents spoke on the condition that their full names not be published because of their illegal status.)\par \par \uc2 To avoid the perils of an illegal river crossing, they paid an American friend from Georgia to bring Liliana by car through a border station, with valid documents belonging to another child.\par \par \uc2 A vigilant inspector detected the document mismatch. Her parents got the phone call from a border agent in Laredo, Tex., at dawn on April 3. Liliana had been detained, he said, and if they did not come immediately, she could be held for many months.\par \par \uc2 ''Don't do any more psychological damage to her than you have already,'' the agent said, in words Mrs. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz recalled with tears of anguish.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz rushed to Texas, but Liliana had already been transferred to a federal detention shelter for minors near Brownsville. It took nearly a month for the parents to secure Liliana's release.\par \par \uc2 To their relief, Liliana was content there. She ate well, played and went to school. Her biggest complaint was that she had been placed in an arithmetic class with children who could not do addition or subtraction.\par \par \uc2 ''I already knew how to add,'' Liliana said firmly.\par \par \uc2 But there was no lawyer to accompany her to her first court hearing on June 4. Her parents stayed away, fearful of the immigration officer at the court entrance.\par \par \uc2 ''I had to speak by myself,'' Liliana recounted in her small voice.\par \par \uc2 Even with an interpreter, Liliana had a hard time following the hearing. She gave the judge her name and age. But she did not understand that she had crossed an international boundary, or that she was now in the United States, or what the United States is exactly. She did not know she had done anything wrong.\par \par \uc2 The judge set a new hearing date and urged Liliana to get a lawyer. But the volunteer lawyers her parents consulted in South Texas have been reluctant to take her case, which is weak since both parents are here illegally.\par \par \uc2 Yet under the administration's prosecutorial discretion policy, deportations of very young children can sometimes be suspended, even if they entered recently.\par \par \uc2 To make the complex argument for discretion, however, Liliana needs a lawyer. Her parents may soon have to decide what to do if she is ordered to leave. Will they give up what they have gained in the United States and return with her -- or let her be sent back alone to a violent Mexican state?\par \par \uc2 Navigating the System\par \par \uc2 Most unaccompanied migrants are teenagers from Mexico and Central America, seeking safety and work in the United States. In most cases minors from Mexico will be quickly returned there, without any formal court proceeding. Minors from noncontiguous countries are charged with immigration violations and detained. Either way, an overwhelming majority have been required to leave.\par \par \uc2 But a recent report found that as many as 40 percent of unaccompanied minors who were detained in federal shelters were eligible for some kind of legal immigration status. The report was by the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit group that provides services to thousands of youths.\par \par \uc2 Through the courts, young migrants can gain legal status if they were severely abused or neglected at home or were victims of human traffickers. Sometimes they have relatives living here legally who can sponsor them. In a few cases, children have discovered that they were United States citizens but did not know it.\par \par \uc2 Even if a judge determines that young migrants must leave, they can ask to depart voluntarily. If they are actually deported, the consequences are severe: in many cases they cannot return legally to the United States for 10 years.\par \par \uc2 Yet young people have little chance of navigating the system without lawyers. Parents often do not understand that their children, no matter how young, must attend court hearings or the judge can issue a final deportation order -- the equivalent of a criminal arrest warrant -- in absentia.\par \par \uc2 Conditions for unaccompanied migrants have improved in recent years. It is not unusual for youths to recall the detention shelters, which are run by the Department of Health and Human Services, as some of the best times in their battered lives.\par \par \uc2 Immigration courts, despite an already severe overload, have designated special days for juvenile cases, with judges trained to deal with children. The courts offer briefings for family members about a child's obligations. Many judges will do what Judge Achtsam did for Juan, extending the schedule to leave the child plenty of time to be reunited with his family here, so they can plan his next legal step.\par \par \uc2 But these advances have been strained by this year's surge. In the spring, federal officials set up emergency shelters in gyms along the border and at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. Although the crisis has passed, officials now say they expect a ''new normal'' of about 15,000 unaccompanied minors in detention a year, almost double previous levels.\par \par \uc2 Groups that provide legal services have been overwhelmed. Kids in Need of Defense, known as KIND, is scouring the country for volunteer lawyers. In Harlingen, Ms. Linsky has told the court that ProBAR cannot provide in-depth representation to all the new detained minors on its docket.\par \par \uc2 ProBAR will at least reach minors to explain their rights. For younger children, staff members offer advance tours to help them to get to know the courtroom. They ask children to draw pictures of how they crossed the Rio Grande -- which Mexicans call the Rio Bravo, the Angry River.\par \par \uc2 One afternoon, Violeta Discua, a legal assistant, gave a marathon three-hour talk to two dozen feisty teenagers, who at first rolled their eyes and slouched in their chairs.\par \par \uc2 Soon they were riveted.\par \par \uc2 ''Who arrested you?'' Ms. Discua asked, spreading her arms and scowling to imitate the eagle that sits atop the badges of agents.\par \par \uc2 ''The Border Patrol!'' they responded, delighted at her pantomime.\par \par \uc2 ''What do they want to do with you?'' she asked.\par \par \uc2 ''Deport us!'' they shouted.\par \par \uc2 She gave a message many of them later said they had never heard before: ''Remember, no one can mistreat you. No one can hit you, not even with their little finger.'' She wiggled her pinkie.\par \par \uc2 The youths fell silent, taking that in.\par \par \uc2 ''Are you bad people?'' Ms. Discua asked.\par \par \uc2 ''No!'' they exclaimed. She explained the rudiments of their limited legal options, the procedures for their court appearances and what they should expect if they were expelled from the United States, as most would be.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes, a Victory\par \par \uc2 When children appear in court without lawyers, it can be distressing for them and for judges. One judge tried to put a boy at ease by asking playfully to share a bit of the child's lunch. Thinking that he was supposed to have brought food for the judge, the boy burst into tears.\par \par \uc2 Migrants who have gotten help from lawyers have won immigration cases they could never have attempted alone. Edu\u237\'00\'EDn Rodr\u237\'00\'EDguez, now 18, was abandoned by both parents in Honduras. He rode the tops of freight trains across Mexico and swam the Rio Grande to Hidalgo, Tex.\par \par \uc2 Caught and sent to a shelter, Edu\u237\'00\'EDn made contact with ProBAR lawyers, who realized he was a strong candidate for a special immigration status for abused or neglected juveniles.\par \par \uc2 The legal battle wound from immigration court to Texas family court and back to immigration court. By the end, not only Edu\u237\'00\'EDn had won a permanent resident's green card. The lawyers also discovered that his sister, Cintia, who is one year older, had made the same journey before him and was living illegally in Texas. Through Edu\u237\'00\'EDn's case, she also became a legal resident.\par \par \uc2 The siblings support themselves on their own in Harlingen. They share a small apartment, and Edu\u237\'00\'EDn has been working full time, helping his sister while she went to school. Cintia graduated from high school in May with honors and also completed a nurse aide program at a local community college.\par \par \uc2 ''I left Honduras because I didn't want to be a loser,'' said Cintia, who is now working part time at a supermarket while she continues her nursing training. She plans to enlist in the Navy.\par \par \uc2 ''It really was worth it,'' Cintia said, ''all the pain I went through, the hunger on the trip, the thirst. I'm a successful person now because I graduated and I'm going to college.''\par \par \uc2 Flashing a smile, she displayed her most vital documents: her Texas nurse aide certificate and her green card.\par \par \uc2 ''Thanks to God I'm here legally,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Liliana Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz, 6, is in deportation proceedings in Texas. Her  parents, here illegally, are afraid to appear with her in court.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc28}{\*\bkmkend toc28}\b \uc2 Border Cities Are Burdened With Calls for Help\b0\par\par\uc2 By IAN LOVETT   \par \uc2 1,095 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 August 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CALEXICO, Calif. -- The calls come in thick and fast from the border, just blocks from the fire station here.\par \par \uc2 A woman suffered heatstroke in line at the port of entry. A person detained by customs officers complained of chest pain. An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  broke his leg trying to hop the 20-foot wall that divides Calexico from its Mexican twin city, Mexicali.\par \par \uc2 In each case, the Calexico Fire Department responded.\par \par \uc2 All along the Southwest border, from San Diego to Brownsville, Tex., local fire departments respond to medical calls as they would to any emergencies within their city limits. But such calls for medical assistance at the border have become a growing burden on the finances and resources of fire departments in cities like this one, in the California desert 100 miles east of San Diego.\par \par \uc2 Last year, with trips to the port of entry and the Border Patrol station and others to assist injured fence-jumpers, Calexico firefighters responded to 725 calls associated with the border -- a fifth of all calls the department received.\par \par \uc2 Chief Pete Mercado said the department's lone ambulance would sometimes make 10 trips to the port of entry in a given day. For many of those, he said, the department is not able to collect payment, while the ambulance is rendered unavailable for other emergencies.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a very difficult thing for us to continue to do without some type of funding,'' Chief Mercado said. ''We've absorbed the cost for all these years. I can't express how difficult it is.''\par \par \uc2 Representative Bob Filner, a Democrat who represents California's entire border with Mexico, introduced a bill last year that would have required the federal government to reimburse cities for the cost of providing emergency response services at the border. But with Congress struggling to reduce the $1 trillion federal deficit, the bill seems unlikely to pass.\par \par \uc2 ''At a time when every city budget is affected, the federal government should not be relying on local revenue to deal with these issues,'' Mr. Filner said. ''Unfortunately, there is very little understanding of the border situation in Congress.''\par \par \uc2 Calexico is hardly the only city fire department strained by constant runs to the border.\par \par \uc2 In San Diego, the Fire Department responded to more than 2,000 medical emergencies at border crossings last year. In San Luis, Ariz., at least 70 percent of the calls that the Fire Department receives come from the port of entry, officials said.\par \par \uc2 A huge portion of the patients at the ports of entry or in Border Patrol custody have no health insurance, according to the fire departments, leaving the departments to cover the cost of care.\par \par \uc2 In El Paso through the first six months of this year, the Fire Department collected reimbursement on 18 percent of the cost of calls to the ports of entry, compared with a collection rate of more than 50 percent for all calls.\par \par \uc2 In Douglas, Ariz., the fire chief, Mario Novoa, estimated that about 15 percent of the department's calls came from the port of entry. Firefighters also offer medical assistance to people the Border Patrol finds in the desert, more than 25 miles outside the city limits.\par \par \uc2 Chief Novoa called the collection rate on trips associated with the border ''dismal'' and ''a burden on the taxpayers.''\par \par \uc2 Not all calls from the border involve medical emergencies. In the area around Calexico, many citizens who moved to Mexico after the economic crisis of 2008 in search of a lower cost of living return to the United States for medical care, firefighters said, often calling 911 to get to the hospital. Others, tired of waiting in line at the port of entry, where the sun is a hammer, use the ambulance like a taxi to get across the border more quickly.\par \par \uc2 ''We do have individuals who abuse the system,'' said Luis Cebreros, a spokesman for the San Luis Fire Department.\par \par \uc2 Chief Mercado said without assistance from the federal government to help offset the cost of the border runs, he worries that Calexico city officials might outsource the fire department.\par \par \uc2 Already, the federal government does cover some of the costs that local fire departments incur in responding to calls from the border. Some departments received federal grants -- in San Luis, the grants account for most of the fire department's operating budget, while in Calexico and Douglas, grants make up less than 10 percent of the budgets, according to fire officials.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the federal government is responsible for the cost of medical care when a person has been taken into custody by customs officers or Border Patrol agents.\par \par \uc2 In practice, however, fire chiefs in several border cities said they were seldom able to collect any reimbursement from the \uc2 United States Customs and Border Protection\uc2  service in such cases.\par \par \uc2 ''Sometimes the calls do originate from the Border Patrol, when the patient is in custody, and the bill does get sent to the federal government,'' Chief Novoa said. ''The fact of the matter is, though, we don't recoup anything. You'd think it would be a no-brainer.''\par \par \uc2 Officials from Customs and Border Protection declined to provide statistics about reimbursement for medical treatment of people in custody.\par \par \uc2 In Calexico, each call -- be it a heart attack or someone looking for a ride -- usually ties up the city's lone ambulance for at least an hour, as firefighters drive to the nearest hospital, in neighboring El Centro, and back.\par \par \uc2 Sylvia Bernal said she worries that the delay might have been fatal for her mother. Eight years ago, Ms. Bernal, now 62, called 911 when her mother began complaining of back pain. The Calexico Fire Department sent a fire truck and paramedics, but they waited 20 minutes for the ambulance, which was on another call, to arrive.\par \par \uc2 By the time the ambulance reached the hospital, her mother's lung had collapsed. She died hours later.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know what would have happened if the ambulance would have gotten there in time,'' Ms. Bernal said. ''To have to live with this 'what if' for a long time, I don't wish that on anyone.''\par \par \uc2 Firefighters Ryan McEachen and Eddie Ainza tending to a man in Calexico, Calif., before taking him to El Centro Regional Medical Center.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 When Alabama's immigration law was passed in the spring of 2011, it was the boldest test yet of the doctrine of self-deportation. If the state put up legal obstacles to nearly every aspect of illegal immigrants' lives, as a chief sponsor of the law put it at the time, it would ''make their lives difficult and they will deport themselves.''\par \par \uc2 While other states had levied sanctions against employers and empowered the police to check for citizenship status, Alabama's law staked out new territory, shutting off access for those in the state illegally to virtually every facet of regulated life, from water utilities to rental agreements to dog tags.\par \par \uc2 In the year since the law went into effect, that new territory has significantly shrunk.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued three decisions that assessed Alabama's law as well as a similar law in Georgia. The findings did not dramatically change the reality on the ground, for the most part continuing to block provisions already on hold, and even allowing two sections currently blocked to go into effect.\par \par \uc2 But the findings were the first broad determinations by an appeals court since the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's decision in June on an immigration enforcement law in Arizona. And while the judges applied the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's ruling, they also went considerably beyond it, blocking statutes in Alabama and Georgia that the highest court had not directly considered.\par \par \uc2 On the Alabama law, the appeals court struck down many of the measures that had gone furthest in making the everyday lives of illegal immigrants so difficult.\par \par \uc2 ''It put pretty serious limitations on what states can do,'' said Mary Bauer, the legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been a leader in lawsuits against the state. ''They certainly can't do it in this wholesale way that Alabama tried to do.''\par \par \uc2 The law had sought to render any contract with an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  unenforceable, to make it a state crime for such immigrants to apply for jobs and to make the ''willful failure'' of an immigrant to carry legal documents at all times a crime as well. Among its most hotly debated provisions, the law required public schools to verify the immigration status of students and their parents at the time of enrollment, and to keep a tally of children in the school system who are here illegally.\par \par \uc2 In striking down those provisions, the judges drew on the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's ruling on the Arizona law but also cited a wider range of high court decisions concerning the balance between states and the federal government on immigration.\par \par \uc2 ''We are convinced that Alabama has crafted a calculated policy of expulsion, seeking to make the lives of unlawfully present aliens so difficult as to force them to retreat from the state,'' the judges wrote. They concluded that policy was in direct conflict with federal law.\par \par \uc2 Significantly, the court in Atlanta, which is not known as especially liberal, found that Alabama's statute requiring schools to keep a record of illegal immigrants was a violation of equal protection guarantees, without referring to Arizona. That decision was the harbinger of a new phase of arguments over immigration, which will focus more on the civil rights impact of state action and less on conflicts between state and federal authority.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers and activists who had helped Alabama and Georgia to craft their laws were sharply critical of many parts of Monday's ruling.\par \par \uc2 ''Given what's been going on it's hard to understand what recourse states are left with if they want to cooperate in enforcement of our immigration laws,'' said \uc2 Dan Stein\uc2 , president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which has drawn up templates for many state laws.\par \par \uc2 The backers of the law did have some victories to claim in the rulings.\par \par \uc2 Echoing the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 , which upheld Arizona's measure authorizing the police to inquire about immigration status, the judges allowed similar though even tougher provisions in Alabama's law. The appeals court also lifted a hold on a provision that made it a crime for illegal immigrants to obtain certain licenses, like car tags or professional licenses.\par \par \uc2 The judges said they allowed that provision to go into effect because the Alabama legislature itself had significantly narrowed its scope this summer, restricting its application from practically every government activity, including pet tags, to six specific licenses, some of which were already forbidden for illegal immigrants anyway.\par \par \uc2 While some of the law's staunchest backers have expressed dismay about the whittling away of the law, other Alabama lawmakers said this was simply part of the process of finding out what would stand.\par \par \uc2 ''The sponsors of this bill were very clear that they wanted to push the envelope, that they did want to test the law,'' said State Senator Bryan Taylor of Alabama, a Republican.\par \par \uc2 He said that the provisions of the law that have gone either unchallenged or have been upheld, such as obligating police to check for immigration status, were the parts he had most strongly supported. Some other parts of the law, which made it an outlier compared with other states, Senator Taylor said he had little confidence would survive anyway.\par \par \uc2 ''I was ultimately comfortable voting for the bill knowing some of the provisions I objected to would be blocked, but also knowing that provisions I supported would be left in there,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120822e88m00037\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Part of Alabama's immigration law that ordered public schools to check the citizenship status of new students was ruled unconstitutional on Monday by a federal appeals court that also said the police in that state and Georgia can demand papers from criminal suspects they have detained. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Alabama schools provision wrongly singles out children who are in the country illegally. Alabama was the only state that passed such a requirement, and the 11th Circuit previously had blocked that part of the law from being enforced. The panel did leave in place part of the injunction blocking a section of the Georgia law that allows for the prosecution of certain individuals who knowingly harbor or transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  during the commission of a crime. Both private groups and the Obama administration filed lawsuits to block the law, considered the toughest in the country.\par \par \uc2  The decisions follow a \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2  ruling upholding parts of a similar Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120821e88l0003j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc31}{\*\bkmkend toc31}\b \uc2 A College Lifts a Hurdle For Illegal Immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAN FROSCH   \par \uc2 894 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 August 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER -- Monday is the first day of the school year for Metropolitan State University of Denver, a compact, urban campus in the heart of the city's downtown.\par \par \uc2 It also signifies the dawn of a controversial new policy for this institution of 24,000. Among the crowd of students who will show up for class next week are dozens of illegal immigrants who, as part of a specially tailored tuition rate, can now qualify for a reduced fee if they live in Colorado.\par \par \uc2 The new rate, approved by the university's board of trustees in June, has garnered praise from immigrant rights advocates here who have tried for years to get legislation passed that would allow state colleges to offer discounted tuition to local, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 But the policy has also drawn the ire of conservatives who are threatening to sue the university to keep the rate from being put in place and have accused Metro State of openly defying Colorado law.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Jordan\uc2 , Metro State's president, said the board took action after Colorado lawmakers failed to pass a similar tuition proposal this year. ''Clearly, from our perspective, these are young people who were brought here of no accord of their own,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''I think what our board was saying was, 'Why wouldn't we want to provide an affordable tuition rate for these students?' '' he added. ''So that they can get a college degree and become meaningful contributors to the economy of Colorado.''\par \par \uc2 Under the new rate, illegal immigrants will pay $7,157.04 per year at Metro State. That is nearly $3,000 higher than the tuition for legal Colorado students but about $8,000 lower than what out-of-state students pay.\par \par \uc2 Only those students who attended high school in Colorado for at least three years and received their high school or general equivalency diplomas here are eligible. So far, more than 100 have qualified, university officials said.\par \par \uc2 Dalia Quezada, 18, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, will start her freshman year at Metro State on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Quezada, whose family brought her to the United States when she was 6, said she could not afford college if not for the discount.\par \par \uc2 ''My dream was always to attend a big university,'' she said. ''But realistically, it was too expensive. But when Metro made the change, it opened up an opportunity. It's like my dream is becoming a reality.''\par \par \uc2 Still, in a state where about 20 percent of residents are Hispanic and where the tuition issue generates rancor in the legislature, the new policy has provoked a furor, largely among Republican lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 On June 20, university officials were called before a hearing of the legislature's Joint Budget Committee to defend their plan.\par \par \uc2 That same week, Colorado's attorney general, John W. Suthers, issued a nonbinding legal opinion criticizing the policy.\par \par \uc2 ''The decision by \uc2 Metropolitan State College of Denver\uc2  to proceed on its own to create a new tuition category, undeterred by the legislature's repeated rejection of specific authorizing legislation, is simply not supported by governing law,'' Mr. Suthers said in a statement at the time.\par \par \uc2 According to the Higher Education Alliance, a coalition of Colorado groups that supports the new policy, 13 states offer in-state tuition for students who are in this country illegally. But opponents have defeated similar measures in Colorado six times.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. Suthers, a Republican, declined to address Metro State's tuition rate, saying in an e-mail that the attorney general's office would not comment on ''matters that may potentially be litigated.''\par \par \uc2 Tom Tancredo, a former Colorado congressman and presidential candidate who now heads the Rocky Mountain Foundation, a conservative research organization, said his group intended to sue the university in the next few months.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tancredo, a fierce proponent of tightening immigration laws, said: ''There was a proposal to allow this in the legislature. It failed. In its failure, it seems to me that a pretty strong signal was sent that you can't do this in the absence of law.''\par \par \uc2 Terrance Carroll, a Metro State board member and former Democratic speaker of the state House of Representatives, said there was always a concern about legal action, but the school remained confident the policy was lawful.\par \par \uc2 University officials also said they were heartened by President Obama's executive order deferring deportation of young illegal immigrants who have been in the United States since they were children.\par \par \uc2 Though the deferral program, which began accepting applications this week, does not directly affect Metro State, advocates hope it will help bolster support to expand the tuition policy to other Colorado colleges.\par \par \uc2 Sarahi Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez, 19, who is poised to start her sophomore year at Metro State, said the reduced tuition would allow her to focus on school, rather than worrying about drumming up enough money to enroll.\par \par \uc2 ''It doesn't mean I won't have to work,'' Ms. Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez said. ''But it will allow me to get my dream going.''\par \par \uc2 Dalia Quezada, who will be attending Metropolitan State University of Denver, says its new policy will enable her to afford college.; Sarahi Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez says she will have less anxiety about money and more time to focus on school.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDA former rabbinical aide who may hold the fate of a United States representative in his hands has been arrested on immigration-fraud charges, federal authorities said on Friday.\par \par \uc2 According to a criminal complaint unsealed on Friday, the aide, Ofer Biton, 39, who used to work for Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto of Manhattan, schemed to commit immigration fraud and other illegal acts with other people.\par \par \uc2 United States Magistrate Judge Steven M. Gold signed a warrant on Monday that led to Mr. Biton's arrest late in the week.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Biton, who was arraigned in Brooklyn on Friday and ordered held at the Metropolitan Detention Center without bail, has previously denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer, Jeffrey Udell, declined to comment on Friday.\par \par \uc2 According to the complaint, Mr. Biton deceived the government in June 2010 about the source of $500,000 that he claimed to have put into a new business that was to make him eligible for a permanent visa.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants who can document that they have invested significant amounts of capital in the United States and have created jobs for Americans are often eligible for a permanent visa for themselves and their families. But under the rules, the seed money for the business has to have been obtained honestly.\par \par \uc2 In his papers, Mr. Biton claimed much of the money for his business came from a loan from a family friend.\par \par \uc2 In challenging that account, the complaint strongly hints that the money was raised through more coercive means, like extortion.\par \par \uc2 While it was not mentioned in the complaint, Mr. Biton has also emerged as a key figure in the 2009-10 Congressional campaign of Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican who represents Staten Island and Brooklyn and is seeking re-election. Though Mr. Biton is barred from raising money for federal election campaigns because he is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , he is said to have raised much of Mr. Grimm's campaign money for that race from the rabbi's followers and left the impression with some of them that he expected help with his visa problems in return if Mr. Grimm was elected.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grimm, who has not been charged with a crime, insists he complied with all campaign laws.\par \par \uc2 The presence of Anthony Capozzolo, a prosecutor assigned to the public corruption unit of the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn, at Mr. Biton's arraignment, reinforced the appearance that the case has more significance to the government than a mere immigration case.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Capozzolo has been busy ever since the authorities became aware last year of serious irregularities and turmoil at Shuva Israel, an Orthodox yeshiva on the East Side of Manhattan that Mr. Biton helped establish as the top aide to and translator for Rabbi Pinto, who speaks Hebrew.\par \par \uc2 For several months now, the authorities have been investigating the possibility that Mr. Biton, along with Ronn Torossian, a public relations executive, embezzled millions of dollars in charitable funds from the yeshiva and extorted additional money from the rabbi and his followers until Mr. Biton parted ways with the congregation in 2010. Mr. Torossian, who has not been charged, has emphatically denied any wrongdoing.\par \par \uc2 Asked for comment, his lawyer, Gerald L. Shargel, called the complaint ''a collection of hints and innuendos.''\par \par \uc2 ''There is nothing in the document that requires me to comment,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers who read the complaint said that the charges appeared to have been narrowly drawn to preserve Mr. Biton's ability to become a government witness and cooperate against other possible defendants in a scheme whose tentacles have already touched off public corruption investigations in the halls of Congress and overseas.\par \par \uc2 By focusing strictly on the immigration fraud and not on other areas where Mr. Biton might have criminal exposure, the government may be ensuring that it minimizes the amount of potentially incriminating material it ultimately has to make public about Mr. Biton, since that material could be used by other defendants to attack his credibility or motives, the lawyers explained.\par \par \uc2 ''We're satisfied that this investigation is proceeding and we look forward to the criminal justice system playing itself out,'' said Arthur L. Aidala, Rabbi Pinto's lawyer.\par \par \uc2 Correction: August 22, 2012, Wednesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in some editions on Saturday about the arrest, on immigration-fraud charges, of Ofer Biton, a former rabbinical aide with ties to Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican who represents Staten Island and Brooklyn, misidentified the law enforcement position held by Anthony Capozzolo, a lawyer who was at Mr. Biton's arraignment. Mr. Capozzolo is an assistant United States attorney in the public corruption unit of the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn; he is not the head of that unit. (Roger Burlingame is the chief of the unit.)\par \par \uc2 Ofer Biton has been accused  of immigration fraud.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The work permits that young illegal immigrants can begin applying for next week under a new government policy will let American employers tap a generation of educated workers who have been confined until now to the shadowy corners of the economy, experts on immigration policy say.\par \par \uc2 One of those could be Juan Escalante, a 23-year-old Venezuelan who has been in the country illegally since age 11 and is among those enthusiastic about the new opportunity. Not long ago, Mr. Escalante said, he feared that he might spend the rest of his life working as an assistant manager in an ice cream shop despite earning a bachelor's degree in political science and international affairs at Florida State University.\par \par \uc2 Getting a work permit ''would be amazing,'' he said, allowing him to look for work on Capitol Hill ''to see how policy is driven'' and to save enough money to help him pursue a master's degree in public policy.\par \par \uc2 With the Obama administration about to put its new program in place, the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , a nonpartisan group here in Washington, says that 140,000 illegal immigrants in this country are enrolled in college. An additional 80,000 already have college degrees -- about 48 percent from two-year programs, 43 percent from four-year programs and 8 percent from graduate school.\par \par \uc2 Steven Raphael, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, said many of the young people eligible for the program, which will start accepting applications on Wednesday, were now limited to jobs that do not require proof of citizenship or a work permit. They often have service jobs that pay cash, either in wages or tips, working as restaurant staff members, landscapers, home cleaners, baby sitters or dog walkers. Others start their own businesses off the books.\par \par \uc2 Roberto G. Gonzales, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, said the policy could provide some relief for a small number of the estimated 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the United States, and help solve a problem of ''wasted talent.''\par \par \uc2 In a decade of doing research about illegal immigrants, Professor Gonzales said he had come face to face with college-educated young people limited to low-skilled jobs. Many had training to work in fields like mechanical engineering, health care, education and law. The new policy could allow them to apply for jobs closer to their career aspirations, he said, as well as motivate high school dropouts to ''rejoin the mainstream.''\par \par \uc2 Still, like many other people who advocate for a broader change in immigration policy, he said the policy announced by President Obama in June fell short of the ideal. Professor Gonzales likened it to ''a kind of second-class citizenship'' and a ''legal limbo where status can change overnight with a change of administration, or with expiration of deferment or work permit.''\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the policy argue that it is ill-timed, given a dismal job market that is especially grim for Americans under 30 who do not have college degrees. Talk of harvesting ''wasted talent'' is ''just sugar to make the poison go down,'' said William Gheen, president of Americans for Legal Immigration, a political action committee. Mr. Obama is harming American workers by ''placing more illegal immigrants up against them as competitors,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Those criticisms do not diminish the excitement of young people like Claudia Jimenez, of Florida, who finished high school last year. Asked what she has been doing since, Ms. Jimenez, a 19-year-old native of Venezuela who has been in this country since 2001, laughed uneasily and said she had not been doing anything.\par \par \uc2 ''Now I have something,'' said Ms. Jimenez, who sees a work permit and employment as the first steps toward enrolling in college. ''I can actually do something with my life. Before it was like my life was on pause.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2  says that about 800,000 illegal immigrants are enrolled in American schools from kindergarten through the 12th grade, and 500,000 of them are under the age of 15. About 350,000 young illegal immigrants 16 and older have no high school diploma or equivalent credential and are not enrolled to get either.\par \par \uc2 Clarissa Martinez of the National Council of La Raza, a civil rights organization, said: ''Many people might have thought, 'What's the point; I can be deported any time. I'll find a job in the meantime.' It's a net positive because the high likelihood was that they would have continued to live in and be part of the community anyway.''\par \par \uc2 Having a work permit could also help unauthorized immigrants whose dreams of college are thwarted because they cannot afford to pay tuition with the low-income jobs that they can get now. And if they do manage to get into college, they cannot do work-study jobs, paid internships or clinical training programs built into degree programs. They are typically not eligible for in-state tuition at state universities. Laws also block them from federal grants and loans for college.\par \par \uc2 The personal dream of Maria Marroquin, a 25-year-old from Peru who has been in this country illegally since age 13, is to enroll in law school and become an immigration lawyer -- a goal that had seemed impossible given the cost of tuition. This fall she will start her senior year at \uc2 Dominican University\uc2 , in Chicago's northwest suburbs. So far, she has paid for her education by working baby-sitting and domestic jobs. She also has received aid that \uc2 Dominican University\uc2  sets aside for illegal immigrants -- a rarity in higher education.\par \par \uc2 ''If I do get a work permit it will definitely help me because I'd be able to work and either save money to go to law school or work while I go to school,'' said Ms. Marroquin, who volunteers for Dream Activist, a youth advocacy organization. ''It might not help me pay for all of it, but it will definitely help me pay for some.''\par \par \uc2 Work permits will also serve as proof of legal residence, allowing young immigrants to get driver's licenses -- an immediate benefit because they can look for jobs in places where public transportation is not available. They can also get Social Security numbers. When Mr. Obama first announced the new policy, owners of small businesses praised the change, saying it would make it easier for them to comply with laws requiring them to check the legal status of employees.\par \par \uc2 Angy Rivera, a 21-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Colombia who has been here since she was 3, is waiting to see the program in action before deciding what to do. ''I kind of feel like I'm in a zombie mode,'' she said. Ms. Rivera, who lives in Queens and is a part-time student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she was initially indifferent about Mr. Obama's policy. But when Ms. Rivera, who writes an advice blog for young immigrants, spoke with other young people, she began to change her mind.\par \par \uc2 ''Those who have been close to giving up, who have worked for nothing or been mistreated in their jobs, those who stopped believing in the American government's promise of equality for all, may start to see some ray of sunshine,'' she said\par \par \uc2 Maria Marroquin, 25, says the new work permit policy will help her to get a job that will enable her to pay for her education.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDThe Anti-Capitalist Brigade started gathering early on May Day at Oakland's Snow Park. There was free coffee, oatmeal, doughnuts, fliers with the day's agenda and plenty of pot. A ''street medic'' -- ''I just finished a wilderness first-aid course,'' he told me when I asked about his training -- tended to his first case of the day, a man in his 20s whose leg had been beaten to a purple hue with a metal rod in an overnight fight in the park. Nearby, an organizer reminded protesters to take down the toll-free number for the \uc2 National Lawyers Guild\uc2 : ''This is important. Do not put it in your cellphones, because if you get arrested, the cops will take those away. Write it on your bodies. In indelible ink. There are Sharpies on the table.''\par \par \uc2 No central action was planned. A coalition of labor unions had asked Occupy Oakland, with its proven ability to turn out large numbers of militant activists, to blockade the Golden Gate Bridge, but then withdrew the request at the last minute. Instead, thousands of Occupy protesters met at various ''strike stations'' and fanned out into the streets with shields and gas masks (or the homemade alternative: bandannas soaked in vinegar), transforming downtown Oakland into a roving carnival of keyed-up militants of every shape and size: graduate students, tenured professors, professional revolutionaries, members of the Black Bloc, dressed like ninjas, their faces obscured.\par \par \uc2 Joints were passed, but this was not a mellow crowd. A barefoot man known as Running Wolf grabbed an American flag from outside a popular cop bar and dragged it behind him. Packs of protesters charged into businesses, overturning tables, shattering windows and smashing A.T.M.'s. An activist spray-painted vulgarities on the window of a \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  branch. The Menace was loose again, as Hunter S. Thompson wrote about a different group of rabble-rousers, the Hell's Angels. This riot had a soundtrack, too, a cacophony of chants -- ''Strike! Take Over!'' and ''Take Back Oakland! Kick Out the Yuppies!'' -- overlaid with beating snare drums and the rhythmic thump-thumping of the police and news helicopters hovering overhead.\par \par \uc2 Many businesses were closed, less in solidarity with May Day than out of fear of reprisal from protesters. The rumored targets weren't just the big corporations, but smaller shops that were the quarry of the so-called antigentrification brigade. In an Occupy Oakland twist on the ''Soul Brother'' signs that shopkeepers used during the race riots of the 1960s, Awaken, an upscale cafe and art gallery, had plastered its windows with signs reading: ''We are Oakland. We are the 99%.''\par \par \uc2 As the swarm made its way down Broadway, shouting, pounding on windows and throwing bottles at stores, two Asian immigrants hastily boarded up their small, sad-looking beauty-supply store. When I tried to talk to one of them, he shooed me away -- ''Too busy'' -- and reached for another board.\par \par \uc2 A few blocks away, I spotted Phil Tagami, a real estate developer who has taken to standing guard in the lobby of his downtown office building with a shotgun during protests. Dressed in black fatigue pants and combat boots, he was scuffling with a group of activists who were trying to force their way into another upscale cafe called Rudy's Can't Fail.\par \par \uc2 Clusters of cops in riot gear stood impassively outside a few strategic locations. Others jogged around the city in formation. At one point, a few officers knocked a protester in a black hoodie off her bicycle, pushed her facedown on the ground and roughly zip-tied her hands. An angry crowd quickly converged, chanting, ''Pigs go home!'' Then there was a pop -- the firing of a tear-gas canister -- and a cloud of chemical smoke quickly swept across the block, temporarily dispersing the protesters.\par \par \uc2 As the activists collected at the intersection outside City Hall, Scott Olsen, a 25-year-old Iraq war veteran who was shot at close range in the head last fall with a beanbag round by the Oakland Police, rolled a cigarette and calmly observed the chaos through glazed blue eyes, his long, stringy blond hair protruding from beneath a protective helmet. He looked less like an ex-Marine than a stoned, skinny teenager who had gotten lost on his way to the skate park. I asked him what brought him out. ''I can't stay home on a day like this,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Last spring, as the Occupy movement struggled, vainly, to recapture its lost energy in New York and elsewhere, in Oakland it remained vital. Occupy Oakland was the show that wouldn't close, complete with its own cast of celebrities, including Olsen, the movement's Ron Kovic; Tagami, the city's Charles Bronson; its mayor, an ex-radical herself; her countless critics; and Oakland's infamous police department -- O.P.D.\par \par \uc2 In a sense, Oakland is the last place you would expect to find the most stubbornly active outpost of the Occupy movement. It's a city almost entirely devoid of financial or corporate institutions, a city that ''capital'' fled decades ago. The shimmering skyscrapers of downtown San Francisco, packed with Pacific Heights investment bankers and venture capitalists, are all of 12 minutes away. Silicon Valley, bursting at the seams with dot-com millionaires, isn't much farther. Why not take the fight there, to a more plausible surrogate for Wall Street?\par \par \uc2 Maybe because Occupy Oakland, whether its leaders have articulated it or not, isn't a protest against what Oakland is, but rather what it's in danger of becoming. Oakland may be broke, but all of the wealth being generated in its immediate vicinity needs someplace to go, and some of that wealth is already beginning to find its way to Oakland, to a place that has long been the catch basin of America's radical energies and personalities.\par \par \uc2 Why are radicals so inexorably drawn to Oakland? The cheap rents don't hurt (free, if you're willing to squat in an abandoned house or industrial space, and hundreds apparently are). Oakland is urban, dangerous and poor -- fertile social conditions for inciting revolution. What's more, it has a long, easily romanticized history of militancy. America's last citywide strike, in 1946, took place there; the Black Panthers were born in Oakland; and David Hilliard, a former Black Panthers chief of staff, still gives three-hour tours of the movement's local landmarks and sells his own line of Black Panthers hot sauce: ''Burn Baby Burn.''\par \par \uc2 Running parallel to this history of political militancy is a history of lawlessness. In the early 1970s, when the Hell's Angels were scandalizing America, their most infamous clubhouse was located in East Oakland. The Oakland native Felix Mitchell was one of the first to scale up corner drug-dealing into a multimillion-dollar, gang-controlled business. On his death -- he was stabbed in Leavenworth in 1986 -- the city gave him a hero's send-off: thousands came out to see his coffin borne through his old East Oakland neighborhood by a horse-drawn carriage trailed by more than a dozen Rolls Royces and limousines.\par \par \uc2 In Oakland, the revolutionary pilot light is always on. At the dawn of the 20th century, the Oakland writer and social activist Jack London said this to a group of wealthy New Yorkers: ''A million years ago, the cave man, without tools, with small brain, and with nothing but the strength of his body, managed to feed his wife and children, so that through him the race survived. You on the other hand, armed with all the modern means of production, multiplying the productive capacity of the cave man a million times -- you are incompetents and muddlers, you are unable to secure to millions even the paltry amount of bread that would sustain their physical life. You have mismanaged the world, and it shall be taken from you.''\par \par \uc2 It's a dream that still exists in Oakland -- that the world can be taken from the haves and delivered to the have-nots. Like all dreams that are on the brink of being extinguished, its keepers cling to it with a fierceness that is both moving and an extreme exercise in the denial of the reality that is at their door.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm not afraid to call myself a Communist,'' the rapper and activist Boots Riley told me one morning last spring in the kitchen of his weather-beaten yellow Victorian house in Oakland's Lower Bottoms section. ''I think some people call themselves everything but, because they don't want to associate themselves with the failures and mistakes that other folks who have called themselves Communists have made. But Christians don't stop calling themselves Christians just because some other Christians made some mistakes.''\par \par \uc2 Riley was getting dressed as we talked, combing out his black-power Afro with a cake cutter, a once-popular African-American grooming accessory that he now has to order from online cooking sites. He covered his face unevenly with shaving cream and carefully sculptured his prominent sideburns -- tapered muttonchops that stretch to the corners of his mouth like a pair of giant peninsulas. Virtually anywhere else, Riley would look and sound about as out of place as someone speaking Old English in colonial dress. But in Oakland, a kind of Amish village of retro-radicals, he makes perfect sense.\par \par \uc2 When Riley first visited Occupy Wall Street's encampment in New York, it didn't do much for him. ''It bothered me that there was no agenda,'' he said. ''Just a lot of folks saying, 'I don't have an answer.' '' But Occupy Oakland felt different. ''Our strategy is not just to get people to say, 'We don't like the banks,' '' he said. ''This is about getting folks to confront the system where they are.''\par \par \uc2 In Oakland, Riley is radical royalty, which in hard-left circles helps offset the somewhat credibility-undermining fact that he's also a legitimate hip-hop star, albeit one with a mostly cult following. His father was an N.A.A.C.P. pioneer, militant organizer and civil rights lawyer who met Riley's mother at a 1968 student strike at San Francisco State University. Hanging in Riley's kitchen is a picture of him as an infant, clutching a copy of Frantz Fanon's ''The Wretched of the Earth,'' an anti-colonialist manifesto that was required reading for radical '60s activists.\par \par \uc2 Many local radicals come to Oakland via a nearby U.C. campus: Berkeley, Davis or Santa Cruz. Riley is Oakland-bred. The first action he ever led, at age 15, was a strike to protest budget cuts at his predominantly black public high school. The rapping came later, after the rise of politically conscious, militant hip-hop. There's a long history of popular musicians taking up revolutionary causes. Riley inverted the equation: He was a revolutionary who turned to music to get his message out to more people. His band is called the Coup -- as in coup d'\u233\'00\'E9tat.\par \par \uc2 Riley's politics are extreme. He doesn't want to see capitalism reformed; he wants to see it toppled. ''We need a system that's not based on profit, but that's based on helping people, that's based on some sort of mutual control of resources,'' he says.\par \par \uc2 Recently, Riley has been trying to channel the radical energies that Occupy Oakland unleashed. He's less interested in smashing windows -- ''that's a tactic that . . . immediately draws a line between you and the people'' -- than in gathering new circles of supporters. This can be a challenge given the movement's local record of vandalism and destruction.\par \par \uc2 Later that spring afternoon, I joined Riley as he canvassed a strip mall to let people know about an upcoming protest at a home-foreclosure auction.\par \par \uc2 ''There's this woman Nell who's getting her home auctioned off from underneath her, and we need to go and stop that from happening,'' he told an African-American man inside a \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 . ''What do you think? Do you want to come through and help us save this woman's home?''\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know,'' the man replied. ''You guys have been doing a lot of parading around, tearing stuff up and just getting people upset. It's against the law to shut down the auction.''\par \par \uc2 ''So was integrating coffee shops,'' Riley said. ''Should we not have done that? This would be a whites-only \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  if that hadn't happened.''\par \par \uc2 It's strange to think of Oakland, with its 19 miles of coastal waterfront, as a rust-belt town, but that's exactly what it is. In the late 19th century, Oakland Point was the western terminus for the transcontinental railroad, which, coupled with the city's access to the sea, made it an ideal destination for factories, canneries and warehouses.\par \par \uc2 During World War II, Oakland's factories and shipyards churned out warships at a furious pace, providing jobs to tens of thousands of black migrant workers from the South. From 1940 to 1945, Oakland's African-American population more than quadrupled. The influx of blacks ultimately drove many white residents either to the suburbs or north into the hills. Over the course of the '60s and '70s, the jobs disappeared, and the city spiraled downward.\par \par \uc2 Oakland is now a sprawling and diverse but segregated city of about 400,000, a real-life Monopoly board that operates on a de facto economic principle of urban design: it gets poorer and more dangerous as you descend from the eucalyptus-scented hills into the urban flatlands. Its downtown is still lined with architectural masterpieces, decaying reminders of the city's haute bourgeois past amid unmistakable signs of a diminished present -- like grand prewar hotels that have been converted into Section 8 housing.\par \par \uc2 Oakland's civic core, such as it is, is shrinking. The city has three professional sports teams. One team, the A's, are trying desperately to relocate to San Jose. Another, the Raiders, may wind up in Los Angeles soon -- again. (The city continues to pay about $20 million a year for the deal that brought them back to Oakland.) The third, the Golden State Warriors, who conspicuously refuse to include ''Oakland'' in their name, are preparing to move to San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 Oakland is $2 billion in debt and counting. To balance its precarious budget, the city has been reduced to crude accounting tricks like selling the Kaiser Convention Center -- shuttered in 2006, when the city could no longer afford to maintain it -- to its own redevelopment agency for $28 million.\par \par \uc2 A couple of years ago, in an effort to shore up the city's eroding tax base, members of Oakland's City Council voted to allow the industrial-scale cultivation of medical marijuana and grant permits for four indoor pot plantations of unlimited size before Washington intervened. The city still receives millions in tax dollars from its medical-marijuana dispensaries, but that income stream may be in jeopardy. In April, federal agents descended on downtown Oakland and raided a dispensary and Oaksterdam University -- the so-called Princeton of Pot, which offers classes in cannabis cultivation. (This being Oakland, as the agents filled a U-Haul with confiscated computers and enough pot plants to get much of the city stoned, a crowd gathered outside chanting: ''Shame! Shame! Shame!'')\par \par \uc2 When Oakland officials leave the city government, they tend to not go quietly. Last year, Oakland's departing attorney, John Russo, said he was resigning because he had ''moral objections'' to the way the city was being run. ''The government is led by people who have spent their whole lives fighting authority,'' Russo told me. ''Now they are the authority, and they don't know how to deal with that. It's a uniquely immature and narcissistic leadership group, and that's why they're always fighting with each other.''\par \par \uc2 For a few weeks last fall, Mayor Jean Quan could look out her third-floor office window and into Occupy Oakland's teeming encampment, where, among other goings on, Running Wolf was living in a tree house in an old oak, lowering his waste down in a bucket.\par \par \uc2 The encampment was equal parts revolutionary base camp and modern-day Hooverville. Its kitchen was a popular destination for the hungry, homeless and mentally ill, many of whom were already sleeping in the plaza when the tents appeared. Others weren't far behind. One homeless man, who has since become a prominent figure in the movement, first visited the camp with the intention of stealing pot from the hippies who were living there. It turned out that the pot, like everything else, was free. ''We spent a lot of time counting people to see if we could move some of the mentally ill people out, but a lot of them didn't want to move,'' Quan told me recently. ''These kids were giving them free food, free wine and free dope. I'd stay here, too, if I were them.''\par \par \uc2 Quan's first instinct when the tents rose on Oct. 10 was to let the protesters stay. There were just a few issues that needed addressing: the illegal open fires, the unauthorized and possibly dangerous use of City Hall's power outlets, the 911 calls reporting incidents of violence and sexual harassment inside the camp.\par \par \uc2 Arturo Sanchez, an earnest young deputy city administrator, was dispatched to serve as Oakland's liaison to the movement. His brief was to both express the city's concerns about the camp and to listen to the protesters' complaints. He quickly learned that the protesters wanted nothing to do with him or anyone else representing the city. ''It's a shame,'' he says. ''If they had come to us with an agenda, we're probably one of the few cities that would have written resolutions and lobbied our state legislators and sent a message along with our mayor when she went to the White House.''\par \par \uc2 Oakland's government mistakenly treated an insurrectionist movement as a progressive one. Occupy Oakland's organizers weren't disenfranchised liberals but committed anarchists operating from a revolutionary playbook that prohibited all negotiations with government officials. In fact, government officials were at the top of their target list. As one Occupy Oakland blogger put it, the goal was to launch ''unmediated assaults on our enemies: local government, the downtown business elite and transnational capital.''\par \par \uc2 Once Quan decided later in October to dismantle the camp, everything that could possibly go wrong did. The police moved in on the morning of Oct. 25, a day before she was expecting them to, and while she was on her way back to Oakland from Washington. In clashes with protesters after the raid, they injured an Iraq war veteran, of all people.\par \par \uc2 Quan is not on the best of terms with her own Police Department. She was herself named in a police report shortly before she took office in January 2011 for her conduct at a police-brutality protest, and the police union spent thousands of dollars backing one of her opponents. ''The theory among some of my left friends and among some members of my family was that I was set up,'' she said. ''You know, I was out of town, they closed down the camp a day early and then overreacted. Certain people in the police had tried to set me up before. I mean, my car got booted right after the election.''\par \par \uc2 ''Why?'' I asked.\par \par \uc2 ''To send the message that they can do what they want,'' Quan said. ''That I better watch out.''\par \par \uc2 Quan's efforts at damage control only compounded the mess. After the first eviction, she permitted the protesters to return to the plaza in front of City Hall and set up a second encampment. Days later, thousands of people -- estimates range from 7,000 to 100,000 -- participated in a strike that shut down most of the city's businesses and the port of Oakland, a vital source of jobs and revenues, prompting Quan to label them ''economic terrorists.''\par \par \uc2 The police union, for its part, publicly criticized the mayor for sending ''mixed messages'' about Occupy. On Nov. 14, she kicked the protesters out of the plaza for a second time.\par \par \uc2 By that point, Quan's popularity was in free fall. In December, her approval rating dropped to 19 percent, and she became the target of two recall efforts (both of which have been abandoned).\par \par \uc2 When I met with her in March, Quan told me that she didn't want to waste too much time talking about Occupy. ''It was just a blip,'' she said. ''It came and went.''\par \par \uc2 Several weeks later, on May Day, the protesters were again rampaging through Oakland.\par \par \uc2 By the time Riley and I arrived at the home-foreclosure auction at the Alameda County Courthouse, dozens of protesters were already trying to push their way into the building via a side entrance. The crowd parted for Riley, and he wove his way toward the metal detector in the entryway. A muscular African-American police officer blocked his path. Riley grew annoyed.\par \par \uc2 ''I respect your frustration,'' the officer said. ''I also respect your artistry. I'm a big fan of your music.''\par \par \uc2 The officer started quoting from one of Riley's early songs, ''Fat Cats and Bigga Fish,'' the story of a small-time hustler who sneaks into a black-tie party planning to steal anything he can. It's a comic narrative that builds to an ironic, political twist: the hustler winds up getting a lesson in real hustling when he overhears his city's mayor talking to a corrupt real estate developer. (''Ain't no one player that could beat this lunacy/Ain't no hustler on the street could do a whole community.'')\par \par \uc2 '' 'All right then, let's begin this,' '' the police officer rapped, picking up midway through the song. '' 'Nights like this is good for business.' ''\par \par \uc2 ''You didn't listen to any of the lyrics,'' Riley interrupted.\par \par \uc2 ''Yes I did,'' the officer replied.\par \par \uc2 ''The lyrics are talking about the people being able to express their power and control their environment,'' Riley said. ''And you're stopping that.''\par \par \uc2 ''That has nothing to do with what I'm doing right now.''\par \par \uc2 Word quickly spread that the auction could be taking place around the corner on the steps of the courthouse. ''That's perfect proof of why this movement has to exist as opposed to just art,'' Riley told me as we followed the crowd around to the front of the building. ''Because you can listen to my music and just still be manipulated by other things and end up becoming a cop.''\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of protesters soon gathered on the courthouse steps, chanting: ''Hey, hey! Go home! Our house will not be sold today!'' No one was quite sure what was going on. Was that the auctioneer they had seen walking to his car? Had the auction been postponed?\par \par \uc2 A few protesters spotted a man in khaki shorts, a red Titleist baseball cap and sunglasses, clutching a clipboard with a list of addresses -- a prospective investor, they surmised, who had come to the courthouse to snatch up a foreclosed home or two. A large circle of activists rapidly closed in on him, moving within inches of his face, chanting: ''Scumbag! Scumbag! Scumbag!''\par \par \uc2 Oakland's chief of police, Howard Jordan, a 23-year member of the force, had the misfortune of taking over the department three days after the first Occupy Oakland encampment went up. ''Our chief goal has always been to facilitate people's right to assemble and give them a right to exercise their First Amendment rights,'' he told me shortly after May Day in his office at Police Headquarters, which overlooks a medical-marijuana dispensary, Oakland Organics.\par \par \uc2 That's not exactly how it has looked in viral videos of flash grenades and police-baton beatings at Occupy Oakland protests. In February, the federal monitor charged with overseeing the Police Department said he was ''thoroughly dismayed'' by some of its behavior. In particular, he criticized the department's ''overwhelming military-style'' response to the Occupy protesters. The clashes that took place the night Scott Olsen was injured triggered a record number of internal-affairs complaints. The department has since missed its court-imposed deadline for investigating these complaints; to expedite the process, it outsourced the cases to law firms and investigators, an added expense of $750,000.\par \par \uc2 Jordan was not going to be unprepared for May Day, calling in hundreds of mutual-aid officers from neighboring towns, including SWAT teams. The day proved to be a relative success for the Police Department. Considerable damage was done to the city, and one police car was set on fire, but tear gas and other so-called nonlethal munitions were used only sparingly. There were no serious injuries, and only 39 protesters were arrested, compared with 400 at the last major Occupy action.\par \par \uc2 But Occupy is just the beginning of Jordan's problems. On the most basic level, his department can't protect its citizens. Budget cuts continue to reduce the size of the force -- to 640 today from 800 officers in 2010 -- even as incidents of violent crime continue to rise: Oakland's murder rate is up 5 percent over last year, when 110 were killed, and robberies are up 24 percent.\par \par \uc2 Oakland's police force already consumes more than 40 percent of the city's general-purpose fund. Clearly, this is not enough. After a round of layoffs in 2010, the department announced that it would no longer respond to burglaries and break-ins that were not in progress. (They have since amended the policy so officers will now respond to home burglaries ''when possible.'') Officers have not discouraged store owners in especially dangerous neighborhoods from arming themselves.\par \par \uc2 The department's every move is scrutinized by federally appointed independent monitors, a result of a settlement agreement reached with the city in 2003, when four Oakland police officers were accused of planting evidence, falsifying reports and using excessive force. It gets worse. The department's efforts to comply with the settlement agreement and implement reforms have cost it millions in extra payments to independent consultants. And that's in addition to the $57 million the department has paid over the last decade to settle various police-misconduct lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 According to the city's former police chief, Anthony Batts, the federal scrutiny has, perversely, hurt the department's ability to fight violent crime in Oakland, forcing the department to assign more detectives to internal affairs than to homicides. ''You wind up with tons of police officers inside a building counting data so you can check off boxes,'' Batts told me. ''Meanwhile, people are dying in the streets.''\par \par \uc2 Batts resigned abruptly in October after just two years on the job, taking the customary potshots at the city on his way out the door. (He told a reporter that Oakland treats its Police Department like ''a necessary evil.'')\par \par \uc2 His successor, Jordan, now finds himself dealing with a demoralized force, only 15 percent of whose officers actually live in Oakland, according to Quan. Jordan is also dealing with a community that doesn't trust the men and women sworn to protect them. Like everything else in Oakland, the negative perception of the department is entangled with the city's history: in the aftermath of World War II, Oakland's municipal leaders recruited white Southerners to police their increasingly black city.\par \par \uc2 Jordan's department is running out of time to comply with the reforms mandated by the settlement agreement. In a matter of months, the O.P.D. could be placed in federal receivership. I asked Jordan how the federal government would go about running a municipal police department. ''I don't know,'' he said. ''I don't think there's ever been a police department that has gone into receivership. It's not something that I want to be the first to do.'' He paused for a moment to give the matter a little further thought. ''I imagine that I would become an assistant chief.''\par \par \uc2 ''Why is this happening to Oakland?'' Ignacio De La Fuente, a city councilman, asked me, gesturing toward his office window in the midst of the May Day chaos. ''It's our fault. The mayor failed to recognize that this was a problem that if we let grow would have a detrimental impact on the city. The mayor failed miserably dealing with Occupy, and she's failing miserably now.''\par \par \uc2 We were sitting on the second floor of Oakland's deserted City Hall, a gorgeous, cream-colored, Beaux-Arts wedding cake of a building -- America's first government skyscraper -- that rose from the rubble of the Great Earthquake of 1906. Downstairs, police officers in riot gear stood guard in front of the building's entrance. Their presence was by no means a symbolic gesture: when Occupy protesters turned out en masse for an action in late January, City Hall was ransacked. Windows and glass display cases were smashed, flags stolen and burned, an architectural model of City Hall itself toppled.\par \par \uc2 De La Fuente, a small, tough-looking man with a raspy, Spanish-inflected voice, sneaked across the Mexican border in 1970, unable to speak a word of English. He started out as a dishwasher, then became a machinist and labor leader. He was elected in 1992 to Oakland's City Council as part of a wave of left-wing political reformers fighting for impoverished neighborhoods devastated by unemployment, crack cocaine and municipal neglect in the '80s.\par \par \uc2 As he ranted, De La Fuente sounded more like a law-and-order Republican than a former \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and militant union organizer. ''This incredible amount of money we have spent baby-sitting these people,'' he said, referring to the protesters. ''It should be absolutely unacceptable.''\par \par \uc2 Oakland can have a peculiar effect on progressive politicians. In 1999, the corporate-America-bashing former-and-future California governor Jerry Brown swept into the mayor's office and promptly set about undertaking an ambitious, aggressively pro-business agenda for the city. Brown, who had a Labrador named Dharma, was soon cozying up to real estate developers, lobbying the state to loosen its environmental review process on urban construction and conjuring visions of a new Oakland, with a downtown ballpark for the A's and a luxury resort hotel and casino. The centerpiece of his redevelopment plan, the 10K Project, was to lure 10,000 well-off residents to gleaming downtown condominium towers, establishing a new tax base and driving the growth of retail stores and restaurants.\par \par \uc2 De La Fuente was now straining to be heard over the protest raging outside. An aide closed the window, but the noise continued to seep in. The councilman went on, almost shouting: ''The national and international bad reputation, the perception and the reality unfortunately that Oakland is a place where they can do things that they cannot do anywhere else, that it's a magnet for troublemakers -- we're seeing that here again today.''\par \par \uc2 As if on cue, a loud bang rang out -- the detonation of a flash grenade from the Oakland Police.\par \par \uc2 Manifesto Bicycles is a boutique bike shop in downtown Oakland that specializes in single-speed and fixed-gear bikes, or ''fixies,'' and also sells a small selection of Oakland-made apparel, like a T-shirt featuring a bicycle tire, a razor blade, a syringe and the words ''Welcome to Oakland.'' Its owners are the husband-and-wife team of Sam Cunningham, a 44-year-old former professional skateboarder and herpetologist, and MacKay Gibbs, who describes herself as a ''music fanatic with a passion for vintage everything and a nose for business.''\par \par \uc2 Their small capitalist enterprise -- named to evoke the famous anti-capitalist tract -- represents another side of Oakland, albeit one that's still in its infancy. Think of it as a less twee, more D.I.Y. version of artisanal Brooklyn. Oakland even has its own take on the Brooklyn Flea, known as the Art Murmur, a sprawling hipster street fair, cultural bazaar and gallery-and-pub-crawl. At the Flea, you can buy refurbished manual typewriters; at the Murmur, you can buy Sharpie-on-foam-cup drawings by a local artist.\par \par \uc2 The collision between Oakland's growing cadre of small-business owners and the local Occupy movement has produced some memorable moments of low comedy. In November, 30-year-old Alanna Rayford, who owns a showroom for local fashion designers in a Gothic Revival building downtown, closed up shop to join the march to the port. She returned the following morning to find the windows of her store smashed and some artwork missing. One of the paintings, a gorilla smoking a blunt, had been placed on prominent display at the entrance to the Occupy encampment.\par \par \uc2 Investment money tends not to flow into cities with soaring violent-crime rates and large numbers of militant nihilists for whom revolution is less a branding opportunity than an active, ongoing goal. And Governor Brown just eliminated the state's economic redevelopment agencies, which will make it much harder for small businesses to open in Oakland.\par \par \uc2 Like pioneers in an unsettled urban frontier, Oakland's small-business owners have had to band together. They are talking about creating an emergency fund for those who can't cover their payments in a given month and are experimenting with the reseeding of neighborhoods. Recently, a ''pop-up hood'' appeared in Old Oakland, the city's original downtown. Six small businesses temporarily operated rent-free in order to test the viability of adding retail stores to a quaint enclave that has been experiencing a boomlet in bars, restaurants and residential conversions and construction.\par \par \uc2 For all its fragility, a transformation is clearly under way in Oakland. The tent poles of the new American city have already arrived -- the urban bike shops, the restaurants with locally sourced fare, the cafes with fair-trade coffee, a Whole Foods. There is a distinctly Oakland character to many of these businesses -- Awaken, whose menu includes a Santa Cruz-brewed ginger ale at $3.50 a bottle, says its mission is to ''bring people together and launch movements'' -- but it's an unmistakable part of the same trend that has been taking hold across urban America for years.\par \par \uc2 It is, in a word, gentrification, and what's most striking about its arrival in Oakland is that it's just now getting there -- that the city has existed for so long as a kind of living museum of 1970s radicalism, its culture of militancy, poverty, crime rates and dysfunctional government all conspiring to delay what now seems inevitable. ''For years, Oakland has been the black hole in the middle of the great galaxy of Northern California as it shimmered its way into the electronic age,'' says Richard Walker, an urban-geography professor who recently retired from the University of California, Berkeley.\par \par \uc2 In this context, May Day -- and Occupy Oakland, more broadly -- looks less like an expression of the city's indomitable radical spirit than the last gasp of a protest movement overmatched by the encroaching forces of capitalism. Oakland is simply too geographically well positioned and financially underexploited not to absorb the creative, professional and entrepreneurial overflow from more expensive places like San Francisco, Silicon Valley and Berkeley. And as it continues to develop its own gritty-chic cachet, there's a good chance Oakland might become more than just a default option for some of the Bay Area's nouveau riche.\par \par \uc2 What will this transformation mean for Oakland? It should produce a bigger tax base that can help improve city services and maybe even create a more effective police force. But gentrification is not a recipe for job creation. In the end, Oakland's income inequality can only grow, making it not so different from so many other American cities. ''You will still have poverty, decay and decline in the midst of immense plenty,'' Walker says.\par \par \uc2 The utopian vision for a post-capitalist Oakland clung to by Boots Riley and the rest of the city's revolutionaries will soon be dead. But radical Oakland will live on, awaiting its next opportunity to rise up, even as the city itself evolves. For every young tech worker moving into a downtown condominium tower or entrepreneur gobbling up cheap, deserted retail space, there's sure to be a militant graduate student drawn to a city that has just added another chapter to its long radical history.\par \par \uc2 Ever since its encampments were dismantled, Occupy Oakland has been talking about reoccupying a public space and establishing a new beachhead for the revolution. Earlier this year, the protesters tried, unsuccessfully, to take over the abandoned Kaiser Convention Center.\par \par \uc2 On May Day, rumors were rampant that after the protests wound down, they would take back the City Hall plaza. As dusk fell, thousands of activists converged on City Hall, dancing, drumming, distributing leaflets for their various revolutionary movements.\par \par \uc2 But when the sky darkened, the number of officers on Broadway multiplied. The familiar warning followed: ''I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly and . . . command all those assembled to immediately leave. If you do not do so, you may be arrested or subject to other police action . . . which may result in serious injury. . . . If you refuse to move, chemical agents will be used.''\par \par \uc2 The threat worked. Soon, just a few hundred determined protesters remained, rattling their metal shields, hurling obscenities and glass bottles at the police. The Menace's last stand. Only this group was small enough to manage. The police charged the crowd, pushing it north up Telegraph Avenue. People raced past Awaken, with its ''We Are Oakland. We Are the 99%'' signs. The cafe's tattoo-covered owner hastily unlocked the door to let a few fleeing protesters in as the riot cops chased the retreating herd from downtown.\par \par \uc2 Correction: August 19, 2012, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Aug. 5 about Oakland and the Occupy movement misstated the point at which Scott Olsen, a veteran of the Iraq war, was injured by the police. It was during protests after a police raid on the protesters' camp on Oct. 25, 2011, not during the raid.\par \par \uc2 Boots Riley is a rapper and activist who doesn't want  to see capitalism reformed; he wants to see it toppled.

\par\par \uc2 MAN IN THE NEWS RAFAEL EDWARD CRUZ\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc35}{\*\bkmkend toc35}\b \uc2 A Republican Voice With Tea Party Mantle And Intellectual Heft\b0\par\par\uc2 By ERIK ECKHOLM   \par \uc2 1,156 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 August 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON -- As a teenager, Ted Cruz was an intense and eloquent parser of free-market economics, dazzling Rotary Clubs here in Houston by reciting the Constitution. At Princeton, he was a champion debater and an intellectual leader of a band of conservative students. He was a star at Harvard Law School and clerked for the chief justice of the United States.\par \par \uc2 But few may have imagined Mr. Cruz, 41, in his newest role, as the Tea Party favorite and Republican candidate for the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2 , trading verbal orchids with the likes of Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck. Mr. Cruz earned the nomination on Tuesday in a runoff election after more than a year of sweaty street campaigning, drawing national attention for beating Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, the more experienced nominee of the Texas Republican establishment.\par \par \uc2 ''I'd have predicted that he would be a professor, not a politician,'' said Robert P. George, Mr. Cruz's adviser at Princeton in the early 1990s. Professor George, a noted social conservative, said that Mr. Cruz stood out even among his Ivy League peers as ''intellectually and morally serious,'' writing his thesis on the separation of powers.\par \par \uc2 ''But he's certainly not a shrinking violet,'' Professor George quickly added in an interview on Tuesday -- to which, Mr. Dewhurst, a wealthy conservative who had the support of Gov. Rick Perry, can attest.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz's victory in November is all but assured in this heavily Republican state and marks a shift to the right in the already conservative party here. Political elders and experts who have watched him during his time here as state solicitor general and on the campaign trail predict that he will be an intellectual force in Congress on behalf of constitutional limits on federal power. He is expected to join Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina and other Tea Party icons as an uncompromising irritant of mainstream Republicans and Democrats alike.\par \par \uc2 It helps, of course, that Mr. Cruz has the smooth good looks and practiced speech of a television host and is able to channel his knowledge into sound bites.\par \par \uc2 ''He has the potential to be a national figure,'' said Mark P. Jones, a political scientist at Rice University, noting Mr. Cruz's intellect and oratorical skills.\par \par \uc2 ''He'll be a senator from the second-largest state in the nation,'' Mr. Jones said, ''and he's very good on television, a perfectly designed politician for today's 24-hour news cycle.''\par \par \uc2 Speaking to the Values Voters Summit in Washington in October, Mr. Cruz drew a standing ovation as he repeated the themes of the political and religious right, sometimes sounding more ideologue than intellectual. He called President Obama the country's ''most radical president,'' railed against the ''gay rights agenda'' and warned against new threats to ''religious liberty.'' Within days, National Review anointed him ''the next great conservative hope.''\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, as he greeted supporters in sweltering heat outside a polling station, Mr. Cruz and his wife, Heidi, were picture-perfect, not a wrinkle on their clothes nor a hair out of place.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz said that his first dive into electoral politics had left him feeling ''invigorated and inspired.''\par \par \uc2 ''Every day, I come home with a spring in my step,'' he said to the wildly enthusiastic group of grass-roots volunteers and to the cameras. ''We've got to work together to stop the Obama agenda and take this country back.''\par \par \uc2 Rafael Edward Cruz was born on Dec. 22, 1970, in Calgary, Alberta, where his parents worked in the oil business.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz's parents are central to the personal narrative he tells, how he got so devoted to his conservative brand of freedom. His father, also Rafael, now a Baptist pastor, fled Cuba in 1957 with $100 sewn into his underwear and worked his way through the University of Texas. His mother, Eleanor, was the first in her family to finish college, at Rice, and ran an energy company. They returned to Texas when he was a child, and he graduated from a Baptist high school in Houston.\par \par \uc2 His father told him as a child, Mr. Cruz often says, that ''if we lose our freedom here, where do we go?''\par \par \uc2 Tuesday night, Mr. Cruz was joined on the victory stand by his parents, his wife and two small, blond daughters who held their hands over their ears as the large crowd cheered wildly.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz tends to spend any spare time with his daughters, said his friend Kelly Shackelford, president of the Liberty Institute, an evangelical Christian legal group based in Texas.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz worked in private law practice in the late 1990s and then began his turn into politics, working on the presidential campaign of George W. Bush and then working at the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2  and the Justice Department.\par \par \uc2 In 2003 he returned to Texas as solicitor general, giving him a direct chance to press for his ideals in the courts.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz argued before the Supreme Court nine times and has trumpeted his successes. In his most notable victory, the court affirmed the right of Texas to ignore instructions from the \uc2 International Court of Justice\uc2  and the Bush administration to review an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 's death sentence.\par \par \uc2 He also helped argue that Texas could have a monument to the Ten Commandments at the Capitol, and keep the words ''under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance. But critics say that in the campaign he took too much credit for his own role in those cases, which are red meat for his evangelical supporters. Since 2008 he has worked in a private law firm here, Morgan Lewis, often representing corporate clients.\par \par \uc2 In the runoff campaign, Mr. Cruz scorched his opponent with charges that he was a conciliator, too quick to compromise. But Mr. Cruz has yet to grapple with the seemingly impossible choices faced by Congress as it seeks to balance the budget without gutting Medicare or Social Security, for example.\par \par \uc2 In the last few days of the campaign -- perhaps in a last-minute effort to attract mainstream Republicans, or perhaps in a preview of the tasks ahead -- Mr. Cruz sounded a bit more conciliatory himself, suddenly talking about ''reaching across the aisle.''\par \par \uc2 In a brief interview on Tuesday, he said that his role model in this respect was Ronald Reagan. ''President Reagan stood for conservative principles in a way that brought people together,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have too often had it backward, he said, ''making hateful attacks but then compromising on basic principle.''\par \par \uc2 ''But I am not willing to compromise on allowing the government to keep growing and expanding our debt,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''I'd have predicted that he would be a professor,'' said Ted Cruz's onetime Princeton adviser.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama's health care law is putting new strains on some of the nation's most hard-pressed hospitals, by cutting aid they use to pay for emergency care for illegal immigrants, which they have long been required to provide.\par \par \uc2 The federal government has been spending $20 billion annually to reimburse these hospitals -- most in poor urban and rural areas -- for treating more than their share of the uninsured, including illegal immigrants. The health care law will eventually cut that money in half, based on the premise that fewer people will lack insurance after the law takes effect.\par \par \uc2 But the estimated 11 million people now living illegally in the United States are not covered by the health care law. Its sponsors, seeking to sidestep the contentious debate over immigration, excluded them from the law's benefits.\par \par \uc2 As a result, so-called safety-net hospitals said the cuts would deal a severe blow to their finances.\par \par \uc2 The hospitals are coming under this pressure because many of their uninsured patients are illegal immigrants, and because their large pools of uninsured or poorly insured patients are not expected to be reduced significantly under the Affordable Care Act, even as federal aid shrinks.\par \par \uc2 The hospitals range from prominent public ones, like \uc2 Bellevue Hospital Center\uc2  in Manhattan, to neighborhood mainstays like \uc2 Lutheran Medical Center\uc2  in Brooklyn and Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego. They include small rural outposts like Othello Community Hospital in Washington State, which receives a steady flow of farmworkers who live in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 No matter where they are, all hospitals are obliged under federal law to treat anyone who arrives at the emergency room, regardless of their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 ''That's the 800-pound gorilla in the room, and not just in New York -- in Texas, in California, in Florida,'' Lutheran's chief executive, \uc2 Wendy Z. Goldstein\uc2 , said.\par \par \uc2 Lutheran Medical Center\uc2  is in the Sunset Park neighborhood, where low-wage earning Chinese and Latino communities converge near an expressway. Hospitals are not allowed to record patients' immigration status, but Ms. Goldstein estimated that 20 percent of its patients were what she called ''the undocumented -- not only uninsured, but uninsurable.''\par \par \uc2 She said Congressional staff members acknowledged that the health care law would scale back the money that helps pay for emergency care for such patients, but were reluctant to tackle the issue.\par \par \uc2 ''I was told in Washington that they understand that this is a problem, but immigration is just too hot to touch,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 The Affordable Care Act sets up state exchanges to reduce the cost of commercial health insurance, but people must prove citizenship or legal immigration status to take part. They must show similar documentation to apply for Medicaid benefits that are expanded under the law.\par \par \uc2 The act did call for increasing a little-known national network of 1,200 community health centers that provide primary care to the needy, regardless of their immigration status. But that plan, which could potentially steer more of the uninsured away from costly hospital care, was curtailed by Congressional budget cuts last year.\par \par \uc2 That leaves hospitals like Lutheran, which is nonprofit and has run a string of such primary care centers for 40 years, facing cuts at both ends.\par \par \uc2 On a recent weekday in Lutheran's emergency room, a Chinese mother of two stared sadly through the porthole of an isolation unit. The woman had active tuberculosis and needed surgery to drain fluid from one lung, said Josh Liu, a patient liaison.\par \par \uc2 The disease had been discovered during a checkup at one of Lutheran's primary care centers, where the sliding scale fee starts at $15. But the woman, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , had no way to pay for the surgery.\par \par \uc2 Another patient, a gaunt 44-year-old man from Ecuador, had been in New York eight years, installing wood floors, one in Rockefeller Center. The man had been afraid to seek care because he feared deportation. Finally, the pain in his stomach was too much to bear.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Daniel J. Giaccio\uc2 , leading the residents on their rounds, used the notches on the man's worn belt to underscore his diagnosis, severe B-12 deficiency anemia. The woodworker had lost 30 pounds in a month, and his hands and feet were numb. Reversing the damage could take months.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a severe case of sensory loss,'' Dr. Giaccio said. ''Usually we pick it up much sooner.''\par \par \uc2 In some states, including New York, hospitals caring for illegal immigrants in life-threatening situations can seek payment case by case, from a program known as emergency Medicaid. But the program has many restrictions and will not make up for the cuts in the $20 billion pool, hospital executives said.\par \par \uc2 Groups that favor more restrictive immigration policies said they agreed that the cuts in the $20 billion fund were a burden. They said hospitals obviously had a duty to provide emergency care for everybody, including illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ''I kind of like living in a society where we don't let people die on the steps of the emergency room,'' said \uc2 Mark Krikorian\uc2 , the executive director of one such group, the \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2  in Washington.\par \par \uc2 But he said the answer lay in enforcing laws, so that illegal immigrants leave the country, not in extending health coverage.\par \par \uc2 ''There is no ideal resolution to the problem, other than reducing the illegal population,'' he said. ''Incorporating illegal immigrants into health exchanges or directly taxpayer-funded health care legitimizes their presence.''\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration said the Affordable Care Act supported safety-net hospitals in other ways, pointing to measures that raise payments for primary care and give bonuses for improvements in quality.\par \par \uc2 ''We are taking important steps to make health care more affordable and accessible for millions of Americans,'' Erin Shields Britt, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an e-mail. ''Health reform isn't the place to fix our broken immigration system.''\par \par \uc2 With illegal immigration an issue in the presidential campaign, many politicians continue to steer clear of addressing the cuts.\par \par \uc2 Hospitals in New York State now receive $2.84 billion of the nation's $20 billion in so-called disproportionate share hospital payments.\par \par \uc2 Those payments start shrinking in 2014 under the law, and drop to $10 billion by 2019.\par \par \uc2 ''It is a difficult time to really advocate around this issue, because there is so much antipathy against new immigrants,'' said Alan Aviles, president and chief executive of the Health and Hospitals Corporation.\par \par \uc2 The corporation runs New York City's public hospitals, which treated 480,000 uninsured patients last year, an estimated 40 percent of them illegal immigrants. The same worries haunt tiny Othello Community Hospital, in Washington state's rural Adams County, where it is the only hospital for miles around.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the state began requiring that participants in a basic health plan prove that they are citizens or legal residents.\par \par \uc2 As a consequence, 4,000 out of the 4,400 patients at the nearby primary care center, mostly immigrant farmworkers, lost their coverage, leaving Othello more financially vulnerable when those people need emergency care.\par \par \uc2 In Central California, Harry Foster, director of the Family HealthCare Network, another primary care center, called the Affordable Care Act ''a double-edged sword.''\par \par \uc2 Many low-wage earning citizens now lack employer-sponsored health insurance, and the health care industry is already competing for those who will gain coverage through the law. But no one is competing to treat those it leaves out, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''We will receive more and more of those patients,'' he said, estimating that 40 percent of the area's residents were \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  farmworkers. ''But financially, we can't take on all the uninsured patients in the area, to the exclusion of all the others, and survive.''\par \par \uc2 In many ways Lutheran, a century-old hospital that refurbished a defunct factory to serve as its hub in the 1960s, has been a prototype of the law's new model: coordinating primary and preventive care to improve health outcomes while curbing costs. Yet it stands to lose $25 million from the cuts.\par \par \uc2 ''This is an unintended consequence of the law,'' said Ms. Goldstein, the hospital's chief executive. ''But so far, nobody is doing anything to resolve it.''\par \par \uc2 Ivan Cortes, the director, speaks to patients at Park Ridge Family Health Center. It was started by Lutheran Medical Center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a hub for Latino and Chinese communities.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- The man who calls himself ''America's toughest sheriff'' made his way into the federal district courtroom here on Tuesday wearing a black suit and a stern expression. He spelled out his name for the clerk -- ''Joseph M. Arpaio, A-R-P-A-I-O,'' then raised his right hand, swearing to tell the truth before he took the stand.\par \par \uc2 ''We do not arrest people because of the color of their skin,'' Mr. Arpaio, the Maricopa County sheriff, said in court.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Arpaio, 80, has enjoyed unparalleled popularity during his 20 years as the elected sheriff. Known as Sheriff Joe, he is running for a sixth term while facing his biggest challenges yet: a lawsuit by the Justice Department, and the federal civil rights trial under way here. Both accuse the sheriff and his office of a pattern of discriminatory policing during large-scale operations known as suppression patrols that singled out Latinos -- including citizens and legal immigrants -- for stops, questioning and detention.\par \par \uc2 This federal trial resulted from a class-action lawsuit by plaintiffs representing every Latino pulled over by Mr. Arpaio's deputies since 2007.\par \par \uc2 ''You didn't always look at illegal immigration as a serious crime, correct?'' said Stanley Young, a lawyer for the six named plaintiffs in the lawsuit. ''That's correct,'' Mr. Arpaio replied.\par \par \uc2 The Mr. Young sought to highlight inconsistencies between what Mr. Arpaio has said and written about immigrants, mostly Mexicans, and his explanations of those statements in court. The sheriff sounded meek and appeared uncomfortable at times as he was asked to explain his words and actions.\par \par \uc2 For example, Mr. Young played part of a television interview in which Mr. Arpaio said that being compared to the Ku Klux Klan was ''an honor, it means you're doing something.'' When questioned about it, Mr. Arpaio testified on Tuesday that he had ''no use for the K.K.K.''\par \par \uc2 He once called his office a ''full-fledged federal immigration agency.'' On Tuesday, he backed away from that description, testifying that illegal immigration was one of the crimes his office focused on, but not the only one.\par \par \uc2 At times Mr. Arpaio seemed his own adversary. Mr. Young read aloud several passages from Mr. Arpaio's second book, co-written by Len Sherman. At one point, the book asserts that Mexicans crossing the border into Arizona, California and Texas were engaged in an effort of ''reconquista'' -- retaking the land that was once theirs. Another passage expressed the opinion that second- and third-generation Mexicans living in the United States maintained ''identities, from language to customs to beliefs, separate from American mainstream.''\par \par \uc2 ''My co-author wrote that,'' Mr. Arpaio testified on Tuesday, his voice raspy, symptoms of a recent battle with the flu.\par \par \uc2 Judge G. Murray Snow, who is presiding at the trial, allotted each side 20 hours to present evidence and testimony. He began the day reminding both sides of how much time they had used -- plaintiffs: 2 hours, 47 minutes; defendants: 3 hours, 9 minutes -- before engaging in an examination of his own.\par \par \uc2 He called back to the stand Deputy Sheriff Louis DiPietro, who had been the last witness to testify on Thursday, the first day of the trial. Mr. DiPietro, who joined the sheriff's office in 1988, pulled over a driver carrying a group of day laborers the driver had just picked up at a church parking lot in suburban Cave Creek in 2007, among them Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres, a Mexican schoolteacher here on a tourist visa, and one of the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 The judge wanted to know about his training (most of it took place online, Mr. DiPietro said), the level of communication among officers assigned to the detail that carried out the traffic stop (there was a quick briefing before it got started, he said), and his understanding of the purpose of the action.\par \par \uc2 ''Some type of investigation about illegal aliens,'' Mr. DiPietro said.\par \par \uc2 Judge Snow wanted to know if he thought day laborers generally were in the country illegally. ''I do,'' Mr. DiPietro replied.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Arpaio's lawyer, Tim Casey, projected onto a screen a written plan for a crime-suppression patrol much like the one Mr. DiPietro participated in. Mr. DiPietro said he recalled seeing a similar document on the day he stopped Mr. Melendres. It contained a paragraph that read, ''At no time'' will Maricopa County sheriff's office personnel ''stop a vehicle based on the race of the subjects in the vehicle.''\par \par \uc2 On the stand, Mr. Arpaio said, ''I am against racial profiling today, as in my 50 years in law enforcement.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Young worked to prove otherwise. He read from notes, news releases and transcripts of messages left on a hot line Mr. Arpaio set up to collect tips about suspected \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  activity.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Arpaio testified that he ''very seldom'' suggested locations for the patrols; the task was left to his subordinates, he said.\par \par \uc2 A protest unfolded outside the courthouse, where four people who had entered the country illegally sat on a banner laid on the ground -- ''No papers, no fear,'' it read -- blocking traffic at the intersection of Washington Street and Fourth Avenue.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm here. Come and arrest me,'' one of them, Miguel Guerra, a father of three from Mexico who has lived in Phoenix for 13 years, said into a megaphone.\par \par \uc2 The police eventually arrested him and the others who had joined him.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Joseph M. Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., spoke at a news conference in Phoenix last week. He and his office face federal civil rights charges.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc38}{\*\bkmkend toc38}\b \uc2 Tales of Pain and Healing, From a Physician Who Knows Both\b0\par\par\uc2 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   \par \uc2 1,189 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 July 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ''This is where Tanisha came, all the way from Brooklyn,'' Dr. Eric Manheimer said, pointing to a forbiddingly cold stone doorway, as he walked around his old haunts at Bellevue, the nation's oldest and probably most famous public hospital, the other day.\par \par \uc2 ''It was the dead of winter,'' he went on. Tanisha, a teenage foster child, walked across the Williamsburg Bridge to an intake center next to Bellevue to avoid being raped again in the home where she had been placed. She knew the city hospital would have to take her. ''She had to come here and get admitted to save her life.''\par \par \uc2 Most New Yorkers associate \uc2 Bellevue Hospital Center\uc2  with the criminally insane, and indeed, it is the place where prisoners in shackles and orange coveralls are sent for treatment. But Dr. Manheimer, 63, sees it as a refuge, a place where those who fear they have exhausted all their options in life often find hope and a last chance at redemption.\par \par \uc2 Tanisha is one of the 12 patients whose stories Dr. Manheimer, Bellevue's medical director for 15 years, tells in his first book, ''Twelve Patients: Life and Death at \uc2 Bellevue Hospital\uc2 ,'' which was released this week by Grand Central Publishing.\par \par \uc2 He recounted how he came to identify with his patients not just as their doctor, but as one of them -- he is, in fact, one of the 12 in the book. His discovery that he had throat cancer makes for one of the more poignant and harrowing chapters of the book.\par \par \uc2 He found that being a patient is lonely. A Hannibal Lecter-type mask was fitted to his face and bolted to a metal table below him to deliver radiation treatment. ''You're aware of life going on around you and you're just there, by yourself,'' Dr. Manheimer said.\par \par \uc2 In between treatments, the mask, labeled MANHEIMER, E., hung on a shelf along with dozens of others, ''like fencing masks.'' (He was treated at \uc2 NYU Langone Medical Center\uc2 , Bellevue's private sister hospital, because, he says, he did not want to be surrounded by people who knew him.)\par \par \uc2 The night before his first treatment, his son's wife went into labor with his first grandchild, at Bellevue. With a tinge of regret, he describes how he was so consumed by his own illness that he had to go home before the baby was born. Seven weeks later, miserable from the treatment, he wanted to discontinue it and allow himself to die. ''It was like gradually going into a black hole and going further and further away from everybody around you,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 His wife insisted that he go on, and saved his life.\par \par \uc2 To all appearances he is back to normal. But the platinum used in his cancer treatment has made it harder to hear and the radiation has restricted his swallowing. ''It feels like a dog's leash around your neck all the time,'' he said. At lunch, he only nibbles at his chicken and refuses dessert.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Manheimer said he had always been fascinated by the personal stories of his patients, and wrote them down, at first just for himself.\par \par \uc2 ''I always have these,'' he said, pulling a notebook from his pocket as he walked Bellevue, leading a tour of the sites described in his book. ''I have 100 of these for 15 years. So when I wrote my book, I just ransacked my notebooks.''\par \par \uc2 Tanisha, like the names of other patients in the book, is a pseudonym. In an afterword, Dr. Manheimer wrote that he disguised the identities of his subjects while leaving intact the ''essential details.'' In an interview, he said that he had changed names and sometimes ages and addresses to protect vulnerable patients, including a ''high profile'' wealthy drug addict, but that they were not composites.\par \par \uc2 He grew up the son of an internist, in the Bronx, and recalled driving around with his father, Robert, as he made house calls. The family \uc2 Peugeot\uc2  was rigged with a spotlight to scout out house numbers on dark streets.\par \par \uc2 ''We lived in back of his office,'' he said the other day. ''The kitchen was a lab. You'd have your toaster and your centrifuge.''\par \par \uc2 As a teenager, he took odd jobs at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, from shaving patients before their operations to answering the phone and running errands in the urology ward. After graduating from medical school at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, he became a doctor at Dartmouth Hitchcock-Medical Center in New Hampshire before returning to New York and taking a job at Bellevue.\par \par \uc2 His wife, Diana Taylor, a professor of performance studies and Spanish at \uc2 New York University\uc2 , grew up in Mexico, where her father was a mining engineer. The couple has a house near Cuernavaca, and Dr. Manheimer speaks fluent Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Walking through the 10th-floor intensive care unit, the soft beeping of monitors in the air, he points and says: ''The patient I took to Mexico was in this bed right here.''\par \par \uc2 The patient, another character in his book, was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with rampant squamous cell cancer, and his last wish was to go home to his family in Mexico, a half-hour's drive from the Manheimer home. Dr. Manheimer used Bellevue's connections with the Mexican consulate to arrange the trip, then flew back with the patient to make sure everything went well.\par \par \uc2 When they got there, Ms. Taylor bought everyone ice cream, in a flavor called beso de angel, kiss of the angel.\par \par \uc2 ''I broke every rule at Bellevue to take care of them,'' Dr. Manheimer said of his patients.\par \par \uc2 In the book, most of the patients' stories are accompanied by brief journeys into political or social commentary on subjects like the North American Free Trade Agreement, mental illness and immigration policy. ''This was a man and his wife trying to gain a millimeter toehold on a brutal economic ladder that was created by political and economic forces beyond their control,'' he wrote of the Mexican patient.\par \par \uc2 A few months ago, he left Bellevue for \uc2 NYU Langone Medical Center\uc2 , where he is working on reducing costs and improving quality and safety. He said felt depleted by the constant air of fiscal crisis in the public hospital system. ''It was time to dial down,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In the I.C.U. during his recent visit, the nurses greet him, surprised to see him back.\par \par \uc2 ''You couldn't stay away?'' one asks.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm like a bad drug addict,'' Dr. Manheimer replies, grinning.\par \par \uc2 ''We're trying to survive another July,'' the nurse says.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Manheimer understands the code. July is when the new interns, straight out of medical school, show up. Ever the medical director, he has a few parting words of advice: ''Do not get sick in July.''\par \par \uc2 Dr. Eric Manheimer came to identify with his patients not just as their doctor, but as one of them, when he underwent radiation treatment for throat cancer.

\par\par \uc2 NEWS ANALYSIS\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc39}{\*\bkmkend toc39}\b \uc2 Immigration Ruling Leaves Issues Unresolved\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON; Kyle Whitmire contributed reporting from Birmingham, Ala.   \par \uc2 1,139 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 June 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court's mixed decision on Arizona's tough immigration enforcement law has laid the ground for years of legal and political wrangling in many states over racial profiling and civil rights, making it likely that the court will be asked to revisit immigration.\par \par \uc2 In its opinion on Monday, the court struck down three parts of the controversial law but let stand a core ''show me your papers'' provision, which requires the police to check the immigration status of anyone they stop if they suspect the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the court also suggested it was open to new challenges based on any adverse impact the law might have on the civil rights of Arizona residents.\par \par \uc2 Legal groups opposed to Arizona's law contend that the police will not be able to decide whom to question without singling out Hispanics and foreign-looking people for special scrutiny. They said the court's opinion, in a lawsuit brought by the Obama administration, clears the way for them to come forward with challenges based directly on claims that the statute will lead to racial profiling of Latinos and immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Fearing that impact, Latinos turned out in street protests across the country after the law, known as S.B. 1070, was enacted in 2010, and they led a boycott of Arizona, together with civil rights and immigrant groups. But claims of discrimination were not squarely addressed in the administration's case.\par \par \uc2 ''The court has opened the door for us to proceed now with the rest of our constitutional claims,'' said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles, which brought challenges against Arizona's law and similar statutes in five other states. ''This type of law is almost impossible to enforce in a racially neutral way, without leading to civil rights violations against people of color,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 On the other side, supporters of Arizona's statute said the Supreme Court's decision would compel them to pursue a new line of legal attack, focusing on what they contend is overreaching by the Obama administration, which they believe the justices encouraged. In its opinion the court broadly endorsed the administration's argument that immigration policy and enforcement are primarily the province of the federal government, not the states.\par \par \uc2 ''The administration is relying on a claim that they have discretion to enforce immigration law,'' said Michael M. Hethmon, general counsel of the Immigration Reform Law Institute in Washington, a group that helped Arizona and many other states to write their own immigration enforcement laws. ''And they are using that claim to really massively expand their direct power.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hethmon's institute is the legal branch of the \uc2 Federation for American Immigration Reform\uc2 , one of the nation's most influential groups seeking reduced immigration.\par \par \uc2 Five other states have enacted laws that are some variation of Arizona's: Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah. Civil rights groups have challenged those laws, and federal courts have suspended some or all of their provisions.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration, in its case against Arizona -- the first challenge to rise to the Supreme Court -- relied almost exclusively on the argument that the state law was invalid because it was in conflict with federal policy.\par \par \uc2 Before the administration filed its suit in 2010, civil rights organizations -- including Ms. Hincapie's center; the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, known as Maldef; and the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  -- brought a separate lawsuit against S.B. 1070. That case, on behalf of labor unions, business groups, churches and immigrant organizations, claims the Arizona law ''will subject many persons of color,'' including Americans and legal immigrants, ''to racial profiling and to unlawful interrogations, searches, seizures and arrests.''\par \par \uc2 The federal court put that lawsuit in abeyance while the Obama administration's case moved forward. But after the Supreme Court's decision, Ms. Hincapie said, the civil rights case can advance again.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court decision heightened attention on Alabama, where lawmakers last year passed an immigration law tougher than Arizona's. While authorizing the police to check immigration status, the law also restricted business contracts and transactions with illegal immigrants, and required public schools to check the status of students.\par \par \uc2 This year, the Alabama Legislature added provisions to make the law even more strict. Based on challenges from rights groups, federal courts suspended many provisions but allowed the ''show me your papers'' section to stand, making Alabama the only state where such a law has gone into effect.\par \par \uc2 Alabama officials and lawmakers said they were both heartened and worried by the court's decision.\par \par \uc2 ''The Supreme Court came down solidly committed to both sides, not solidly for either side,'' said State Senator Scott Beason, a Republican who was a leading sponsor of the immigration bill. ''I was hoping for a more definitive set of guidelines,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Rights organizations, including the \uc2 Southern Poverty Law Center\uc2  in Montgomery, brought two lawsuits against Alabama, both including extensive civil rights claims. They won one round, in which a federal court found the law unfairly prevented illegal immigrants from obtaining license plates for mobile homes.\par \par \uc2 Alabama officials said they were studying the Supreme Court decision to decipher its impact on the state law.\par \par \uc2 ''The people of Alabama want a strong anti-illegal-immigration law,'' said Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican. ''I will keep my commitment to uphold and enforce Alabama's law.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hethmon, of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, said the group was preparing ''creative legal strategies'' to directly contest the Obama administration's view that it can use its federal authority to exercise wide prosecutorial discretion in setting deportation policy. The administration has said it will focus on removing illegal immigrants who are criminals, while sparing others with no criminal records.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hethmon said he would also be advising states on how to devise policing statutes similar to Arizona's so they will be fully consistent with the Supreme Court's guidance.\par \par \uc2 Civil rights lawyers said they will not give up on trying to stop the policing provision of S.B. 1070, which the Supreme Court upheld, from taking effect. They contend the court's opinion pointed to new limits it wanted to impose on the law.\par \par \uc2 ''We feel strongly this law should not be implemented,'' said Thomas A. Saenz, general counsel of Maldef. ''The irreparable harms are just too severe.''\par \par \uc2 Protesters rallied across the street from the White House on May 1, 2010, opposing a newly enacted immigration law in Arizona.

Shear from Washington.   \par \uc2 1,364 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 June 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 While the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's mixed decision on Monday on Arizona's immigration enforcement law gave a big political boost to officials there who supported it, the ruling does not seem likely to unleash a new wave of legislation by other states to crack down on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer and Arizona lawmakers who wrote the law can claim victory because the court's decision allows the authorities to go ahead with its most intensely disputed provision, which requires the police to determine the immigration status of anyone they stop if there is a ''reasonable suspicion'' the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But in practice, the legal opening the justices defined for action by states on immigration is relatively narrow, constitutional lawyers said.\par \par \uc2 On the basis of the ruling, five other states that have already passed similar laws -- Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah -- should be able to defeat some of the many challenges they faced from civil rights organizations, which have held up those laws in the courts.\par \par \uc2 But the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's carefully etched decision also gave opponents of Arizona's law a clear affirmation of the primary role of the federal government on immigration. The court put state governments on notice that they would have to tread carefully to avoid interfering with federal policy if they want to engage in immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 The court also allowed, and even invited, lawsuits against Arizona's law that are based squarely on civil rights claims that it would lead to racial profiling against Latinos and other immigrants -- issues that did not arise directly in the current case. Many civil rights groups, predicting that the police provision of the law would rapidly lead to discriminatory actions by officers once it takes effect, said on Monday that they were ready for that fight.\par \par \uc2 ''If state governments enact new immigration bills, we say bring it on, we will see them in court,'' said Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. His organization has participated with other rights groups in a separate lawsuit against Arizona over the law, known as S.B. 1070, and against immigration enforcement laws in other states.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  struck down three central sections of Arizona's law, which had been regarded by opponents as the most harsh. In allowing the ''show-me-your-papers'' provision to stand, the court accepted, for the time being at least, Arizona's word that police officers would not engage in racial profiling as they put it into practice.\par \par \uc2 Both sides claimed on Monday that they had achieved important gains. Dan Stein, the president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, a group that supported Arizona, called the ruling ''an important victory.''\par \par \uc2 ''Even if the Obama administration refuses to enforce most immigration laws, states have the power to deter and discourage illegal aliens from settling or remaining within their jurisdictions,'' Mr. Stein said.\par \par \uc2 He said the ruling, coupled with a \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  decision last year that affirmed an Arizona law requiring employers to verify the legal immigration status of employees, gives states ''broad latitude to carry out a policy of attrition through enforcement.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stein's organization supported a small but determined corps of lawyers who created legal blueprints for Arizona's and other state laws that were intended to drive out illegal immigrants by making daily life impossible for them in this country.\par \par \uc2 In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican who signed an immigration enforcement law last year, welcomed the court's decision more cautiously.\par \par \uc2 ''It appears the court has upheld the major thrust of our state's statute,'' Mr. Deal said, ''that states have the right to assist in enforcing federal immigration law.'' An appeals court suspended parts of immigration enforcement laws in Georgia and in Alabama, awaiting the decision from the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On the other side, Obama administration officials also offered praise. ''I am pleased the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  confirmed that state laws cannot dictate the federal government's immigration enforcement policies or priorities,'' said Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security.\par \par \uc2 To prove the point, officials from her agency announced that they were suspending seven joint agreements in Arizona under a program, known as 287g, in which they had deputized state and local police to detain illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security officials also said they will send a directive to federal agents in Arizona reminding them that to be consistent with the administration's priorities, they should not pursue deportation of illegal immigrants who have not committed serious crimes or are not repeat offenders.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for both sides, after digging down into the complex decision, were guarded in their assessments.\par \par \uc2 Calling the ruling a ''qualified victory for Arizona,'' Kris Kobach, a constitutional lawyer who helped to write S.B. 1070, said the court had avoided sweeping statements. Though affirming rights of states on immigration, he said, the court also ''left open the possibility that a state action might not be permissible depending on whether it is cooperative'' with federal efforts. Mr. Kobach is now the Kansas secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Latino leaders said they were deeply dismayed that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  had allowed the policing provision of the law to take effect.\par \par \uc2 ''We believe it puts the civil rights of all Americans at risk and it places a bull's-eye on the back of all Latinos,'' said \uc2 Janet Murguia\uc2 , president of N.C.L.R., also called the \uc2 National Council of La Raza\uc2 , one of the nation's largest Latino groups.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romero said that the A.C.L.U. had raised a new ''war chest'' of $8.7 million to combat state immigration laws across the country. ''The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  kicked the can down the road, opening the floodgates to racial profiling and years of litigation,'' Mr. Romero said. ''The constitutional sequel will be much more controversial, messy and costly.''\par \par \uc2 Officials in states that have adopted similar laws said they would have to sort through the court's decision to determine exactly how their statutes would be affected. In Alabama, an especially far-reaching immigration law included provisions imposing mandatory penalties for businesses that hired unauthorized immigrants and requiring schools to check the immigration status of students, neither of which were in Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 In Utah, lawmakers avoided most of the pitfalls the court signaled in the provisions it struck down, Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said Monday.\par \par \uc2 Across a wide spectrum, politicians from President Obama to Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, a Republican, said the decision should spur Congress to move on a broad overhaul of immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 At least eight states considered enforcement legislation this year. But as officials elsewhere have watched the polarized battles in Arizona, the mood appears to have changed. No state passed a law like Arizona's.\par \par \uc2 Correction: June 29, 2012, Friday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article on Tuesday about the impact of the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's decision on Arizona's immigration enforcement law misstated the number of joint agreements with Arizona police that the Department of Homeland Security rescinded in response to the court's ruling. The department halted agreements with seven Arizona police departments under which federal officials had authorized state and local officers to check immigration status and to detain illegal immigrants during stops or investigations. The department did not suspend all joint agreements in Arizona under the program, which is known as 287g. Homeland Security officials say four agreements remain in force; they allow Arizona police to determine the immigration status of foreigners held in jails.\par \par \uc2 THE GOVERNOR: Jan Brewer; SUPPORT: Members of the Tea Party, which favors stricter laws against illegal immigration, outside the Supreme Court on Monday.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- In the place where it all began, there was confusion and consternation on Monday at the United States Supreme Court's unanimous decision to uphold the most controversial portion of Arizona's contentious immigration law, the part that requires law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of people in custody who they suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Many legislators, activists and Latinos here had expected that part of the ruling to go exactly the way it did. What they did not expect was for the court, at the same time, to place so many limits on police powers.\par \par \uc2 Under the ruling, the police cannot hold illegal immigrants in local jails merely because of their status or prohibit them from seeking employment in Arizona, drawing clear lines between state and federal jurisdiction over immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 So there was also surprise and a measured sense of victory from all sides over the mixed decision, as well as questions about what could happen next.\par \par \uc2 During a news conference at the State Capitol here, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican who fervently championed the law, chose to overlook the rulings against the law, saying ''the heart'' of the law, known as SB 1070, ''has proven to be constitutional'' and the state's authority to ''protect its people'' from the dangers of illegal immigration had been upheld.\par \par \uc2 ''Arizona did not ask for this,'' Governor Brewer said, ''but we're here today because the federal government has failed the American people'' by failing to secure the Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 On a patch of grass just outside the Capitol, Senator Steve M. Gallardo, a Democrat, said the Supreme Court had sent the governor ''a loud message,'' telling her she had gone too far in trying to expand her reach into ''an issue that is clearly a federal issue.''\par \par \uc2 Lost in the middle were people like Honorio Hernandez, 35, and Jorge Martinez, 49. They are Mexican immigrants living here under different circumstances -- Mr. Hernandez is a legal resident, Mr. Martinez is not -- but both are nonetheless troubled by the prospect of facing the police.\par \par \uc2 ''Will they be able to stop me because I look the way I look?'' Mr. Hernandez asked as he stepped outside Ranch Market on North 16th Street, a mecca for Hispanic goods.\par \par \uc2 ''Before, I could get stopped and get a ticket for driving without a license,'' said Mr. Martinez, nearby. ''Now, they're going to ask for my papers. Then, what?''\par \par \uc2 In affirming federal jurisdiction over immigration, the Supreme Court ruled that it is up to federal -- not state -- authorities to arrest immigrants if being here illegally is their only offense. So on Monday at the office of Puente, an advocacy group here, workers spent hours urging supporters to join a protest outside the federal immigration offices later in the day. It was a marked shift for an organization whose main target had been Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, who has waged a relentless crackdown against Latinos. In the wake of Monday's ruling, officers with the Department of Homeland Security in Arizona are being reminded to focus on serious criminals and repeat offenders when pursuing deportation, part of a push by the Obama administration to ease the impact of tough enforcement in immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 The administration also revoked on Monday an agreement allowing certain Arizona law enforcement officers to enforce federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, throughout the state, in an effort to avoid claims of racial profiling, police officers and sheriff deputies are being trained -- through an updated version of a video made in 2010, when Governor Brewer signed SB 1070 into law -- to understand what are considered reasonable signs that a person might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A lack of government-issued identification, a foreign vehicle registration or an inability to provide a residential address are among the objective causes for suspicion listed in the video. Others are more subjective, like a person's ''unexplained nervousness or inability to make eye contact,'' ''dress'' or ''significant difficulty communicating in English.''\par \par \uc2 The police chief here, Daniel Garcia, said his department has gone beyond the training, posting messages to the community online and offering additional training to its officers ''in a manner to ensure equal justice under the law is provided to every person irrespective of race, color or national origin.''\par \par \uc2 Chief Garcia went on, ''I want the citizens of Phoenix to have a voice and that includes everyone, all individuals.''\par \par \uc2 Some people here were still skeptical, though. Rosario Perez, 46, a Mexican immigrant and legal resident who was also shopping at Ranch Market on Monday, said she carries her Social Security card wherever she goes because ''Yo soy morena'' -- ''I'm brown.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120626e86q0006m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Cushman Jr. contributed reporting.   \par \uc2 1,507 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 June 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  on Monday delivered a split decision on Arizona's tough 2010 immigration law, upholding its most hotly debated provision but blocking others on the grounds that they interfered with the federal government's role in setting immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 The court unanimously sustained the law's centerpiece, the one critics have called its ''show me your papers'' provision, though they left the door open to further challenges. The provision requires state law enforcement officials to determine the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest if they have reason to suspect that the individual might be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The justices parted ways on three other provisions, with the majority rejecting measures that would have subjected illegal immigrants to criminal penalties for activities like seeking work.\par \par \uc2 The ruling is likely to set the ground rules for the immigration debate, with supporters of the Arizona law pushing for ''show me your papers'' provisions in more states and opponents trying to overturn criminal sanctions for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Writing for the majority, Justice \uc2 Anthony M. Kennedy\uc2  said, ''Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues, but the state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.''\par \par \uc2 Justice \uc2 Antonin Scalia\uc2  summarized his dissent from the bench, a rare move that indicated his deep disagreement. Rarer still, he criticized a policy that was not before the court: President Obama's recent announcement that his administration would not deport many illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children.\par \par \uc2 Justice Scalia's point was a narrow one -- that the states should have the right to make immigration policy if the federal government is not enforcing its own policies -- but it continued a charged back and forth between the conservative justices and Mr. Obama. In his 2010 State of the Union address, Mr. Obama criticized the court's Citizens United campaign finance ruling, which the court reiterated in a separate ruling on Monday.\par \par \uc2 The court also announced that it was extending its term until Thursday, signaling that it would issue its much-anticipated ruling on Mr. Obama's health care law then.\par \par \uc2 Both Mr. Obama and Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, quickly responded to the immigration ruling. Mr. Romney -- traveling, by coincidence, in Arizona -- said in a brief statement that states had the right and the duty to secure their borders.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama emphasized his concern that the remaining provision could lead to racial profiling, an issue that the court may yet consider in a future case. ''No American should ever live under a cloud of suspicion just because of what they look like,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement, adding that he was ''pleased'' about the parts that were struck down.\par \par \uc2 In her own statement, Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, a Republican, said she welcomed the decision to uphold what she called the heart of the law. The decision, she said, was a ''victory for the rule of law'' and for ''the inherent right and responsibility of states to defend their citizens.''\par \par \uc2 Still, the ruling was a partial rebuke to state officials who had argued that they were entitled to supplement federal efforts to address illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration argued that federal immigration law trumped -- or pre-empted, in legal jargon -- the state's efforts. Last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, blocked the four provisions on those grounds, including the one the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  upheld.\par \par \uc2 In its challenge, the administration did not argue that it violated equal-protection principles. At the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  argument in April, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. acknowledged that the federal case was not based on racial or ethnic profiling.\par \par \uc2 In the majority opinion, Justice Kennedy wrote that the ruling did not foreclose other ''constitutional challenges to the law as interpreted and applied after it goes into effect.''\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said on Monday that the federal government would ''continue to vigorously enforce federal prohibitions against racial and ethnic discrimination.''\par \par \uc2 Five other states have enacted tough measures to stem illegal immigration, more or less patterned after the Arizona law: Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah. But most states avoided creating new crimes for immigration violations, as Arizona did in two provisions that were struck down.\par \par \uc2 Lower courts have stayed the carrying out of parts of those laws, and they will now revisit those decisions.\par \par \uc2 In upholding the requirement that the police ask to see people's papers, the court emphasized that state law enforcement officials already possessed the discretion to ask about immigration status. The Arizona law merely makes that inquiry mandatory if the police have reason to suspect a person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a concurring opinion, Justice \uc2 Samuel A. Alito Jr\uc2 . called the administration's attack on the provision ''quite remarkable.''\par \par \uc2 ''The United States suggests,'' he wrote, ''that a state law may be pre-empted, not because it conflicts with a federal statute or regulation, but because it is inconsistent with a federal agency's current enforcement priorities.''\par \par \uc2 Justice Kennedy added that the state law contained safeguards, including ones instructing officials not to consider race or national origin unless already permitted by law.\par \par \uc2 Further restricting the sweep of the majority opinion, Justice Kennedy wrote that ''detaining individuals solely to verify their immigration status would raise constitutional concerns.'' The decision left open, he said, ''whether reasonable suspicion of illegal entry or other immigration crime would be a legitimate basis for prolonging a detention, or whether this too would be pre-empted by federal law.''\par \par \uc2 Chief Justice \uc2 John G. Roberts Jr\uc2 . and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, \uc2 Stephen G. Breyer\uc2  and Sonia Sotomayor joined Justice Kennedy's majority opinion. Justice Elena Kagan disqualified herself from the case, Arizona v. United States, No. 11-182, presumably because she had worked on it as the solicitor general.\par \par \uc2 Had the case ended in a 4-to-4 tie, the appeals court's ruling blocking all four aspects of the Arizona law would have stood.\par \par \uc2 Three justices dissented in part, each writing separately and only for himself. Justices Scalia and \uc2 Clarence Thomas\uc2  said they would have sustained all three of the blocked provisions. Justice Alito would have sustained two of them while overturning one that makes it a crime under state law for immigrants to fail to register with the federal government.\par \par \uc2 The two other provisions blocked by the majority were one making it a crime for illegal immigrants to work or to try find work and another allowing the police to arrest people without warrants if they have probable cause to believe they have done things that would make them deportable under federal law.\par \par \uc2 Scholars who have followed the work of the court for decades said they could not recall an instance similar to Justice Scalia's commentary on a political dispute outside the record of the case under consideration.\par \par \uc2 ''After this case was argued and while it was under consideration,'' Justice Scalia said in his written dissent, ''the secretary of homeland security announced a program exempting from immigration enforcement some 1.4 million illegal immigrants.'' This month, the Obama administration said it would let younger immigrants -- the administration estimates the number at 800,000 -- who came to the United States as children avoid deportation and receive working papers as long as they are not over the age of 30 and have clean criminal records, among other conditions.\par \par \uc2 ''The president said at a news conference that the new program is 'the right thing to do' in light of Congress's failure to pass the administration's proposed revision of the Immigration Act,'' Justice Scalia went on. ''Perhaps it is, though Arizona may not think so. But to say, as the court does, that Arizona contradicts federal law by enforcing applications of the Immigration Act that the president declines to enforce boggles the mind.''\par \par \uc2 He added that Arizona and other states should not be left helpless before the ''evil effects of illegal immigration.''\par \par \uc2 Justice Kennedy responded that ''federal law makes a single sovereign responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and unified system to keep track of aliens within the nation's borders.''\par \par \uc2 ''The national government has significant power to regulate immigration,'' he wrote. ''The sound exercise of national power over immigration depends on the nation's meeting its responsibility to base its laws on a political will informed by searching, thoughtful, rational civic discourse.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  signaled it would issue a health care law ruling on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 People waited in line on Monday to enter the Supreme Court, in anticipation of rulings on Arizona's immigration law and President Obama's health care overhaul.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The challenge to the Affordable Care Act tops the list of \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  rulings expected this week. The big question is whether Congress has the power to require that individuals buy or obtain health insurance as part of a comprehensive reform. Other issues are whether Congress can broaden Medicaid coverage of the poor and taxpayers can even challenge the individual mandate before it takes effect in 2014. The outcome -- aside from determining whether millions of Americans will get health coverage -- will show whether the Roberts court recognizes that constitutional law requires that it defer to Congress on matters affecting the national economy.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona immigration law case is the other major piece of business left. The core issue is whether federal immigration law invalidates the state law, which lets police stop anyone they believe to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and makes it a crime for anyone to be in Arizona or hold a job without valid papers. At oral argument, Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. focused on the doctrine of pre-emption, and brushed aside some effects of the law, whose explicit purpose is ''attrition through enforcement'' by making life so harsh for undocumented immigrants that they would be driven from the state. Arizona's law invites racial profiling and abuse of police power. While the pre-emption issue is significant, the court's ruling will inevitably be judged by many on civil rights grounds if the justices allow the law to stand.\par \par \uc2 Other remaining cases deal with whether a federal law making it a crime to lie about receiving military medals or honors violates free-speech rights and whether a life-without-parole-sentence for someone convicted of murder at 14 violates the Constitution. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said recently that this term has been ''more than usually taxing.'' She may prove right in predicting ''sharp disagreement'' on the remaining cases.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120624e86o0009z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 IZUCAR DE MATAMOROS, Mexico -- Jeffrey Isidoro sat near the door of his fifth-grade classroom here in central Mexico, staring outside through designer glasses that, like his \uc2 Nike\uc2  sneakers and \uc2 Nike\uc2  backpack, signaled a life lived almost entirely in the United States. His parents are at home in Mexico. Jeffrey is lost.\par \par \uc2 When his teacher asked in Spanish how dolphins communicate, a boy next to him reached over to underline the right answer. When it was Jeffrey's turn to read, his classmates laughed and shouted ''en ingles, en ingles'' -- causing Jeffrey to blush.\par \par \uc2 ''Houston is home,'' Jeffrey said during recess, in English. ''The houses and stuff here, it's all a little strange. I feel, like, uncomfortable.''\par \par \uc2 Never before has Mexico seen so many American Jeffreys, Jennifers and Aidens in its classrooms. The wave of deportations in the past few years, along with tougher state laws and persistent unemployment, have all created a mass exodus of Mexican parents who are leaving with their American sons and daughters.\par \par \uc2 In all, 1.4 million Mexicans -- including about 300,000 children born in the United States -- moved to Mexico between 2005 and 2010, according to Mexican census figures. That is roughly double the rate of southbound migration from 1995 to 2000, and new government data published this month suggest that the flow is not diminishing. The result is an entire generation of children who blur the line between Mexican and American.\par \par \uc2 ''It's really a new phenomenon,'' said Victor Zuniga, a sociologist at the University of Monterrey, in Nuevo Leon State, which borders Texas. ''It's the first time in the relationship between Mexico and the United States that we have a generation of young people sharing both societies during the early years of their lives.''\par \par \uc2 Critics of immigration have mostly welcomed the mass departure, but demographers and educators worry that far too many American children are being sent to schools in Mexico that are not equipped to integrate them. And because research shows that most of these children plan to return to the United States, some argue that what is Mexico's challenge today will be an American problem tomorrow, with a new class of emerging immigrants: young adults with limited skills, troubled childhoods and the full rights of American citizenship.\par \par \uc2 ''These kinds of changes are really traumatic for kids,'' said Marta Tienda, a sociologist at Princeton who was born in Texas to Mexican migrant laborers. ''It's going to stick with them.''\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey's situation is increasingly common. His father, Tomas Isidoro, 39, a carpenter, was one of the 46,486 immigrants deported in the first half of 2011 who said they had American children, according to a report by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to Congress. That is eight times the half-year average for such removals from 1998 to 2007.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Isidoro, wearing a Dallas Cowboys hat in his parents' kitchen, said he was still angry that his 25 years of work in the United States meant nothing; that being caught with a broken taillight on his vehicle and without immigration papers meant more than having two American sons -- Jeffrey, 10, and his brother, Tommy Jefferson, 2, who was named after the family's favorite president.\par \par \uc2 As for President Obama, Mr. Isidoro uttered an expletive. ''There are all these drug addicts, drug dealers, people who do nothing in the United States, and you're going to kick people like me out,'' he said. ''Why?''\par \par \uc2 White House officials have said that under a new policy focused on criminals, fewer parents of American children are being deported for minor offenses. On Friday, the Obama administration also announced that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who came to United States as children would be allowed to stay without fear of deportation. The policy, however, does not grant legal status, and because nearly half of the country's 10.2 million \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  adults have children, experts say that inevitably more families will be divided -- especially if deportations over all hold steady around 400,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 But for Jeffrey, the impact of his father's removal in June last year was immediate. His grades dipped. His mother, Leivi Rodriguez, 32, worried that he had become more distant, from both his friends and his studies. Almost every day, Jeffrey told her he wanted to see his father.\par \par \uc2 So six months after her husband's deportation, she sent Jeffrey to live with his father in Mexico, and she followed with Tommy a few months later. It was December when he arrived here in a hill town south of Mexico City, surrounded by fields of swaying sugar cane. On Jeffrey's first night, he noticed something strange in his bed. ''Dad, what's that?'' he asked.\par \par \uc2 ''A scorpion,'' his father said.\par \par \uc2 School here presented new challenges, as well. Jeffrey went hungry at first because neither he nor his father realized that without a cafeteria, students relied on their parents to bring them food at recess.\par \par \uc2 In class, Jeffrey's level of confusion rises and falls. His teacher said she struggled to keep him from daydreaming. ''His body is here, but his mind -- who knows where it is,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Houston -- that is where Jeffrey's thoughts typically drift. There, he had friends, \uc2 McDonald's\uc2 , the zoo. It is where he lingered at the library at Gleason Elementary to catch up on his favorite series of books, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid.'' There, his school had a playground; here, there is just a concrete slab. There, computers were common; here, there are none.\par \par \uc2 ''It was just better,'' Jeffrey said.\par \par \uc2 The educational disparities between Mexico and the United States are not always so stark. At the elementary level, some of Mexico's schools are on par with, or even stronger than, the overcrowded, underfinanced American schools that serve many immigrant children, education experts say.\par \par \uc2 But Mexican schools lag when it comes to secondary education. In many areas of Mexico, especially places where the tradition of migration is not as well established, Mexico's educational bureaucracy can make life difficult for new arrivals like Jeffrey. It is not uncommon for American students to be barred from enrollment for a year or more because they lack proper documents.\par \par \uc2 ''The established rules for registration don't need to be so severe,'' said Armando Reynoso Carrillo, a state legislator from Malinalco, a rural area in Mexico State where dozens of American children have arrived in recent years.\par \par \uc2 The problems extend beyond registration. Mexicans have a long history of greeting returnees with skepticism -- for abandoning Mexico, or because they resent the United States, or view those who moved there as materialistic, culturally out of touch and arrogant. The prejudice often extends to their children.\par \par \uc2 Graciela Trevino Gonzalez said that when she returned to Malinalco three years ago, after more than a decade in California, she could not get her American son onto a soccer team because the coaches refused to accept him without Mexican identification. ''He felt rejected by everyone,'' she said. ''The kids called him 'leche,' 'gringo' -- it was awful.'' Leche means milk and gringo can range from a neutral reference to a foreigner to a slur.\par \par \uc2 Here in the central state of Puebla, Mexican children are especially likely to see transnational students as different, according to surveys by Mr. Zuniga, the sociologist. Some have come to Mexico because of deportations. Others arrived because relatives were sick or without work.\par \par \uc2 But regardless of the cause, Mexican students tend to see their American-educated colleagues as strangers. Jeffrey's experience is typical: He is friendly and quick to open up in English, but quieter at school, where Spanish is the only language one hears.\par \par \uc2 At one point this spring, as Jeffrey sat at the edge of the playground, a larger boy approached from behind and asked if he was from Florida or Houston. When Jeffrey pulled away because the boy had leaned into him, the bigger boy seemed surprised. ''Are you mad?'' he asked.\par \par \uc2 Later, other boys tested Jeffrey on his English, asking him in Spanish to translate various body parts.\par \par \uc2 ''How do you say foot?'' one asked. ''Finger?''\par \par \uc2 ''Eye?''\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey provided one-word answers without enthusiasm. At home, a three-room concrete box with furniture hauled from Houston, he said that many of the children called him Four Eyes. He said he was starting to feel more comfortable academically and socially, but even in a school with 11 other children born or educated in the United States (out of 296) he is still a foreigner. Sometimes, he confuses the Mexican pledge of allegiance with the American version.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Tienda, at Princeton, said children of Jeffrey's age were more likely to struggle with such a difficult transition. ''This is the age where they start to be aware of each other's differences,'' she said. ''They're preadolescents and their identity is being crystallized.''\par \par \uc2 She added that how these students fared over the long term will probably vary widely. Some will make the transition easily while others will suffer setback after setback. It will depend on their language skills, school and family dynamics.\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey, like many other children whose parents have moved them to a country they do not know, seems to be teetering between catching up to his classmates and falling further behind. His parents are struggling to find work and keep their marriage together. Jeffrey, in quieter moments, said he was just trying to endure until he could go home.\par \par \uc2 ''I dream, like, I'm sleeping in the United States,'' he said. ''But when I wake up, I'm in Mexico.''\par \par \uc2 Immigration Upended: Articles in this series are exploring the changing patterns of immigration between the United States and Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey Isidoro, from Texas, now lives in Mexico with his family.

Senate Hopefuls Compete in a TV Debate\b0\par\par\uc2 By THOMAS KAPLAN   \par \uc2 808 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 June 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The three Republicans hoping to challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand fought to stress their differences in a televised debate on Sunday, seeking to draw attention to a primary campaign that has provoked little enthusiasm among voters.\par \par \uc2 All three candidates stuck to broad Republican themes like reducing spending and improving the business climate in New York and the country. But an hour of questions brought out several distinctions on issues, including taxes and same-sex marriage, that are important to the right-leaning voters who are coveted in a Republican primary election.\par \par \uc2 The debate, at the NY1 studio in Chelsea, was moderated by Errol Louis and Liz Benjamin, who host nightly political programs on the NY1 and the YNN cable networks, both of which broadcast the program. It came a little more than a week before the June 26 primary, for which experts expect a very low turnout.\par \par \uc2 The best-known candidate in the field, Representative Bob Turner, who last year won the Brooklyn and Queens seat previously held by Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat, fielded criticism from his opponents for not ruling out tax increases. He has not signed the antitax advocate Grover G. Norquist's pledge to oppose all such increases, unlike his opponents, Wendy E. Long, a Manhattan lawyer, and George Maragos, the Nassau County comptroller.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Long asked Mr. Turner to defend his stance that raising taxes should be on the table in negotiations over reducing the country's budget deficit and debt.\par \par \uc2 ''You know where I stand on this: I just think that we can't ever put those on the table,'' Ms. Long said. ''Your willingness to put them on the table sounds to me sort of like the policies of Barack Obama and Kirsten Gillibrand.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Turner, noting that the White House and the Senate were held by Democrats, struck a tone of practicality and said that for anything to get done, ''we're going to have to talk it out.''\par \par \uc2 ''I'm not going into the negotiations -- and I don't think any Republican should go into the negotiations -- and say, 'This is how it's going to be,' '' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Maragos, who accused his opponents of ''continued indecision'' in defining their stances on tax issues, did not talk of compromise. Asked how he would work with Democrats in Washington like Senator Charles E. Schumer, he pivoted to discussing his decades of business experience in the financial industry.\par \par \uc2 ''I think I would start by trying to teach some of our Congress people some economic theory,'' Mr. Maragos said. ''Unfortunately in Congress we have a lot of attorneys but very few economists and very few business people.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Turner was puzzled. ''I think George's suggestion that we school Senator Schumer in economic reality would be an interesting challenge,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Over all, the debate showcased far more policy similarities than differences -- all three candidates said they supported hydraulic fracturing, for instance. But they tussled ever so slightly even in areas where they agreed, like same-sex marriage.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Maragos criticized Ms. Long for not publicly advocating the repeal of same-sex marriage in New York. Ms. Long said that was not her role, given that she was not a state lawmaker, but Mr. Maragos pressed further, saying it was her duty, since she had the backing of the State Conservative Party -- a distinction that Ms. Long has eagerly publicized.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Turner was not eager to discuss the subject. ''This ship has sailed in New York,'' he said. ''I want to keep the focus on jobs and the economy. The Gillibrand record, the Obama record -- that's what this is going to be about.''\par \par \uc2 In a lightning round of questions, Ms. Long said she would refuse to attend a same-sex wedding on principle. Mr. Maragos said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was a better mayor than Rudolph W. Giuliani; Ms. Long and Mr. Turner, who has Mr. Giuliani's backing, said they favored Mr. Giuliani.\par \par \uc2 Asked if they would report to federal authorities a worker in their home who they found out was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Ms. Long and Mr. Maragos said yes; Mr. Turner said, ''Probably not.''\par \par \uc2 The debate gave the candidates a chance to draw contrasts with one another, which they have struggled to do in recent weeks. A Siena College poll conducted this month found that 70 percent of Republican voters did not favor a candidate.\par \par \uc2 ''Whichever campaign does a better job of identifying their core voters and getting them to the polls, that campaign wins,'' said Steven A. Greenberg, a Siena pollster.\par \par \uc2 George Maragos, left, Wendy E. Long and Bob Turner at the NY1 studio in Chelsea for a primary debate on Sunday.

\par\par \uc2 NEWS ANALYSIS\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc46}{\*\bkmkend toc46}\b \uc2 After Chorus of Protest, New Tune on Deportations\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON and HELENE COOPER   \par \uc2 1,194 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 June 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama decided last week on a major policy shift to stop deportations of young illegal immigrants after administration officials saw that he was losing the initiative to Republicans on an issue he had long championed and that he was alienating the Latino voters who may be pivotal to his re-election bid.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, the White House faced intense pressure from some of its closest allies -- their voices often raised in frustration -- to provide some relief for immigrant communities. The urging came from Harry Reid of Nevada and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the top two Democrats in the Senate, and the Hispanic caucus in the House of Representatives, as well as Latino and immigrant leaders across the country.\par \par \uc2 Bleak figures reported early this month by the Department of Homeland Security showed that a yearlong program designed to shift enforcement away from illegal immigrants who pose no security risk was not producing results, with only about 500 young students nationwide spared from deportation.\par \par \uc2 And last week, students without immigration papers started a campaign of sit-ins and hunger strikes at Obama campaign offices in more than a dozen cities, saying that despite his promises, the president was continuing to deport immigrants like them.\par \par \uc2 After three years of record deportation numbers and cautious moves on other immigration policies, Mr. Obama finally used his executive authority in a sweeping way that surprised even his supporters, ending deportations for at least 800,000 immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children.\par \par \uc2 The announcement on Friday of the new policy prompted a wave of elation among \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, and praise and sighs of relief from Democrats and Latino leaders. Angry Republicans accused Mr. Obama of overstepping his legal bounds to avoid consulting with Congress and started to regroup, recognizing that the president had regained his momentum on immigration.\par \par \uc2 An important change, administration officials said, came from the Homeland Security secretary, Janet Napolitano, who approached the White House in mid-May with a plan to use existing laws to lift the threat of deportation for large numbers of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 After pressing tough enforcement since the beginning of the administration, Ms. Napolitano had been increasingly criticized by Latino and immigrant advocates who said she seemed to be thwarting the president's policies. Since his first campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama had pledged his support for legislation known as the Dream Act, a proposal before Congress that would provide a path to legal status for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Napolitano's shift helped ease rising impatience at the White House with her department. A big stumbling block, White House officials said, was resistance from career staff members and enforcement agents at Immigration and Customs Enforcement to a policy adopted a year ago. It required them to use prosecutorial discretion in picking and choosing among illegal immigrants facing deportation. It was the first time immigration officers had been asked to make such judgments as a regular practice.\par \par \uc2 The National ICE Council, a union that represents deportation agents, outspokenly questioned the policy, saying that its members had not been consulted and that they faced serious risks in distinguishing among immigrants who had violated the law.\par \par \uc2 White House officials were dismayed by the results of a review, initiated in November, of more than 411,000 deportation cases before the nation's immigration courts. By this month, prosecutors had halted the deportation of only 593 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 ''Everyone was surprised by how modest the results were,'' said a senior White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican whose star is rapidly rising in his party, was close to introducing his own bill to help \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students by giving them a temporary status, something quite similar to what White House officials had in mind. They feared Mr. Rubio's proposal would pre-empt the president, making it appear he did not want to work with Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The White House was also awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court, expected any day, on the administration's lawsuit against Arizona over a tough state immigration enforcement law. Campaign officials feared an adverse decision could leave Mr. Obama empty-handed when he tried to mobilize Latino voters for the November election.\par \par \uc2 A big concern for Mr. Obama, White House officials said, was whether he had legal authority to offer relief to so many immigrants. In recent weeks, the White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, and Homeland Security lawyers pored over the law and concluded they were on firm ground. The main point, the officials said, was that the policy would have to be carried out case by case -- meaning the workload for the immigration bureaucracy would be huge.\par \par \uc2 The White House was less concerned about whether it would be circumventing Congress and enraging Republicans. ''Look, every time we sneeze in the direction of an immigrant, someone says it's amnesty,'' the official said.\par \par \uc2 Under the policy, officials are to exercise discretion in deferring deportations of immigrants who qualify for two years. A grant of deferred action, as it is formally known, allows immigrants to apply for work permits. To be eligible, they must be 30 or younger and have come to the United States before they were 16. They must be in school or high school graduates or military veterans, with no criminal records.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama was hearing often from exasperated Democratic lawmakers. Senator Durbin, who first introduced the Dream Act 11 years ago, said he advised the president recently that he would not be able to muster enough votes in the Senate to pass the bill before the November election. In a vote in late 2010, the Dream Act was blocked by Republicans in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 ''Meanwhile,'' Mr. Durbin said, ''we were getting calls every week saying that young people were being deported. We would jump in and save them. But there was anger and uncertainty and fear among them.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Durbin said he had urged Mr. Obama to ''to do something much more sweeping.'' Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a leading Hispanic Democrat, also prodded the White House.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic leaders' message found a sympathetic hearing from Cecilia Munoz, a former immigration reform advocate who is a senior White House adviser to Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 In the end, the policy shift came quickly, White House officials said, with Mr. Obama making his choice early last week, leaving officials scrambling to prepare the logistics in time for his announcement on Friday.\par \par \uc2 The White House agreed that Ms. Napolitano would make the initial statements. Later Mr. Obama went before the news cameras in the White House Rose Garden.\par \par \uc2 ''As long as I'm president, I will not give up on this issue,'' Mr. Obama vowed, calling it ''the right thing to do.''\par \par \uc2 President Obama announcing his decision last week to stop deporting young illegal immigrants. At least 800,000 immigrants may be affected by the new policy.

CUSHMAN Jr.; Kirk Semple and Richard W. Stevenson contributed reporting.   \par \uc2 1,492 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 June 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children will be allowed to remain in the country without fear of deportation and able to work, under an executive action the Obama administration announced on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials said the president used existing legal authority to make the broad policy change, which could temporarily benefit more than 800,000 young people. He did not consult with Congress, where Republicans have generally opposed measures to benefit illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The policy, while not granting any permanent legal status, clears the way for young illegal immigrants to come out of the shadows, work legally and obtain driver's licenses and many other documents they have lacked.\par \par \uc2 ''They are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper,'' President Obama said in announcing the new policy in the \uc2 White House\uc2  Rose Garden on Friday. He said he was taking ''a temporary stopgap measure'' that would ''lift the shadow of deportation from these young people'' and make immigration policy ''more fair, more efficient and more just.''\par \par \uc2 Under the change, the Department of Homeland Security will no longer initiate the deportation of illegal immigrants who came to the United States before age 16u, have lived here for at least five years, and are in school, are high school graduates or are military veterans in good standing. The immigrants must also be not more than 30 and have clean criminal records.\par \par \uc2 Young people, who have been highly visible and vocal activists despite their undocumented status, have been calling on Mr. Obama for more than a year to stop deporting them and allow them to work. Many of them were elated and relieved on Friday.\par \par \uc2 ''People are just breaking down and crying for joy when they find out what the president did,'' said Lorella Praeli, a leader of the United We Dream Network, the largest coalition of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 Republicans reacted angrily, saying the president had overstepped his legal bounds to do an end run around Congress. Some Republicans accused Mr. Obama of violating the law. ''The president's action is an affront to the process of representative government by circumventing Congress and with a directive he may not have the authority to execute,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. ''It seems the president has put election-year politics above responsible policies.''\par \par \uc2 In many ways, the president's move was a clear play for a crucial voting bloc in states that will decide whether he gets another term. It also held the potential for considerable payoff.\par \par \uc2 The action was the first measure by Mr. Obama that offers immediate relief to large numbers of illegal immigrants, in contrast to smaller steps the administration had taken that were intended to ease the impact of deportations but in practice had little effect. During the three years of his term, Mr. Obama has deported more than 1.1 million immigrants, the most by any president since the 1950s.\par \par \uc2 ''Now let's be clear: this is not an amnesty,'' Mr. Obama said in the Rose Garden, anticipating the Republican response. ''This is not a path to citizenship. It is not a permanent fix.''\par \par \uc2 The group of illegal immigrants that will benefit from the policy is similar to those who would have been eligible to become legal permanent residents under the Dream Act, legislation that Mr. Obama has long supported. An effort by the \uc2 White House\uc2  to pass the bill in late 2010 was blocked by Republicans in the Senate. Mr. Obama called on Congress again Friday to pass that legislation.\par \par \uc2 The president was facing growing pressure from Latino leaders and Democrats who warned that because of his harsh immigration enforcement, his support was lagging among Latinos who could be crucial voters in his race for re-election.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants said the new policy would make a major difference in their lives. As students, when they graduate from high school, they often cannot go on to college because they are not eligible for financial aid and must pay higher tuition rates. If they do succeed in graduating from college, regardless of their academic accomplishments, they cannot be legally employed in the United States or obtain driver's or professional licenses.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Pew Hispanic Center\uc2 , a nonpartisan research group in Washington, estimated on Friday that as many as 1.4 million immigrants might be eligible for the new measure. The vast majority are Latinos, with about 70 percent born in Mexico. Many of the students live in states that could be pivotal for Mr. Obama's re-election prospects, including Colorado, Florida, Nevada and New Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Nationally, a Pew Center survey in December found that 91 percent of Latinos supported the Dream Act.\par \par \uc2 For immigrants who come forward and qualify, Homeland Security authorities will use prosecutorial discretion to grant deferred action, a reprieve that will be valid for two years and will have to be renewed. Under current law, that status allows immigrants to apply for work permits.\par \par \uc2 In a memorandum issued Friday referring to the students, Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Janet Napolitano\uc2  instructed all enforcement agents to ''immediately exercise their discretion, on an individual basis, in order to prevent low-priority individuals from being placed into removal proceedings.''\par \par \uc2 But Homeland Security officials said they would begin accepting requests from immigrant students in 60 days, leaving time to prepare procedures to handle the huge response they expect.\par \par \uc2 Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, who is an outspoken critic of illegal immigrants, said he would bring a lawsuit against the \uc2 White House\uc2  to stop the measure.\par \par \uc2 White House\uc2  officials said they chose Friday for the policy shift because it is the 30th anniversary of a Supreme Court decision, Plyler v. Doe, that effectively established that all children, regardless of immigration status, were entitled to public education through high school.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant student leaders praised Mr. Obama, saying his action should convince other students that advocacy could be effective, even for immigrants without legal status. Although the reprieve is temporary, the leaders said they expected that the majority of students would seize the opportunity to work and come out into the open.\par \par \uc2 ''We've done away with the fear,'' said Gaby Pacheco, 27, an Ecuadorean-born immigrant who was among the first in a wave of students in recent years who ''came out'' to declare publicly that they were in this country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama also received praise from Democratic lawmakers, including the Hispanic Caucus in the House and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-highest Democrat in the Senate who is the leading author of the Dream Act. Mr. Durbin first proposed in April 2010 that the president should grant deferred action to young students.\par \par \uc2 Over the past two months Mr. Durbin and other top Democrats, including Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, have quietly urged Mr. Obama to do something significant to help immigrant students.\par \par \uc2 Maricela Aguilar, 21, who was born in Mexico and lives in Wisconsin, said she was in Los Angeles with a group of students when the news came of the new policy.\par \par \uc2 ''We were all watching and listening and screaming out in joy,'' she said. Ms. Aguilar graduated last month from Marquette University, but feared she would never find work professionally.\par \par \uc2 Some students were cautious, recalling that Mr. Obama had promised them help before. ''We don't want to get too excited,'' said Daniela Alulema, 25, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Ecuador who is a leader of the New York State Youth Leadership Council. ''We hope that what was announced will be implemented and will actually help our community.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: June 22, 2012, Friday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the Obama administration's new policy allowing some younger immigrants to avoid deportation and obtain work permits misstated part of the age qualifications established by the new rule. It applies to people who came to the United States as children and were no more than 30 years old -- not ''under 30 years old'' -- at the time the policy was changed by the administrative action last week. The error also appeared on Sunday and on Monday in articles about the new policy.\par \par \uc2 Milca Calymayor, right, was part of a protest on deportations on Friday in Los Angeles.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc48}{\*\bkmkend toc48}\b \uc2 Christians On Right Urge Reform On Migrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By TRIP GABRIEL   \par \uc2 878 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 June 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Some of the nation's most influential evangelical groups urged a solution to illegal immigration on Tuesday that defies the harsh rhetoric of the Republican primary race, which continues to undermine Mitt Romney's appeal to Hispanic voters.\par \par \uc2 The call by the groups represents a recognition that in one bedrock element of the conservative movement -- evangelical Christians -- the demography of their followers is changing, becoming more Hispanic, and that Republican leaders risk being out of step with their hawkish talk of border fences and immigration crackdowns like those in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Tom Minnery, the senior vice president of policy for one evangelical group, Focus on the Family, said many of the 11 million to 12 million illegal immigrants should be free to ''come out of the shadows'' and ''begin the process of restitution'' leading to attaining legal residency.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Minnery spoke at a Capitol Hill news conference called to announce that more than 150 Christian evangelical leaders, including from the Southern Baptist Convention and the National Association of Evangelicals, were endorsing an overhaul of immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 The evangelical leaders expressed opposition to such notions as ''self-deportation,'' which Mr. Romney favored in a Republican debate and which urges strict enforcement of laws to encourage \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers to leave the country.\par \par \uc2 The situation is considered all the more critical given that some important swing states in the coming election -- including Colorado, Florida and Nevada -- have large Hispanic populations that leading Republicans say they must win over to prevail in the states.\par \par \uc2 ''This is the tipping point to finally convince Republican operatives that they must redeem the narrative on immigration reform in order to be a viable party in America's political landscape in the 21st century,'' said the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rodriguez said he met last week with aides to Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, to urge him to moderate his positions.\par \par \uc2 He noted that Hispanics, who account for about 7.5 million of the 82 million evangelicals in the country, are the fastest-growing segment. Hispanic evangelicals are more likely than other Hispanics to identify as conservative and Republican.\par \par \uc2 But so far Mr. Romney has shown no inclination to shift his positions from the primary season, when he attacked his rivals Newt Gingrich and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas for their more moderate immigration stances.\par \par \uc2 Although he has campaigned with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American popular with the Tea Party, Mr. Romney has not endorsed Mr. Rubio's proposal to grant a path to legal residency for some children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romney plans to address a national meeting of elected Hispanic officials on June 21 in Orlando, Fla., and is expected to speak about immigration.\par \par \uc2 For now, Mr. Romney's strategists argue that he need not change his positions because Latino voters will cast ballots in November based on the economy, not immigration.\par \par \uc2 ''Governor Romney believes that legal immigration is a source of strength for America and that to protect legal immigration we must address illegal immigration in a civil but resolute manner,'' said Alberto Martinez, an adviser to Mr. Romney in Florida.\par \par \uc2 ''As president, Governor Romney would work with any groups on a reform that strengthens legal immigration, secures our borders, respects those who are waiting patiently to enter legally and ensures that we do not encourage further illegal immigration.''\par \par \uc2 A pro-reform movement has been percolating among evangelical groups for the past two to three years, with organizations and churches that align with Republicans on issues like abortion and gay marriage supporting President Obama on immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 The National Association of Evangelicals, which represents more than 40 denominations, passed a resolution calling for a comprehensive immigration overhaul in 2009. The Southern Baptist Convention did so last year.\par \par \uc2 It called for ''just, fair immigration reform,'' said Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptists' ethics commission, who also attended Tuesday's news conference.\par \par \uc2 ''It passed with at least an 80 percent vote,'' he said, ''and four of five Southern Baptists is about as good as you're going to get on any given day on anything.''\par \par \uc2 But Focus on the Family, the radio ministry based in Colorado, was a newcomer to the cause of an immigration overhaul.\par \par \uc2 While some advocates favor a path to citizenship for many illegal immigrants, Mr. Minnery of Focus on the Family advocated a path to legal status, like a work visa, only after a fine is paid.\par \par \uc2 ''These are the victims of economic misery, so there's compassion necessary,'' Mr. Minnery said. ''But making restitution is a first step.''\par \par \uc2 ''I think the people are in a different spot than the politicians are on this issue,'' he added. ''I think people are tired of the rhetoric and looking for some improvement in the immigration system.''\par \par \uc2 If illegal immigrants are going to be asked to get in line for legal status, first ''you have to get the lines moving,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 David Fleming, senior pastor of the Champion Forest Baptist Church in Houston, delivered remarks with other evangelical leaders on Tuesday about finding a solution to illegal immigration.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As President Obama heads into the main stretch of his re-election campaign, his immigration policies have produced few gains among Latinos, whose votes could be crucial for him in November.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Homeland Security reported last week that only about 4,400 deportations of illegal immigrants had been halted nationwide under a major initiative started a year ago.\par \par \uc2 In a strategic shift, immigration authorities had said they would focus on deporting criminals and people who cheated the visa system, while sparing illegal immigrants with clean records. But after an administration review of more than 288,000 deportation cases before the immigration courts, the total suspended by prosecutors so far is less than 2 percent.\par \par \uc2 That is not the only policy that has been a jarring disappointment for Latinos. Mr. Obama, who easily won a majority of their votes in 2008, promised to move in his first year to overhaul the immigration system and to give legal status to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 As it becomes clear that Mr. Obama faces a tight race against the presumed Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, pressure is building for him to do something more for Latinos.\par \par \uc2 Early in his term, Mr. Obama put a stop to raids in factories and fields that snared many illegal immigrants who were working to support families. But quiet inspections of employers' hiring records have accelerated, forcing many thousands of unauthorized workers to leave their jobs.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Homeland Security has aggressively expanded a fingerprinting program, which vastly increases the chances for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to be detained, even for minor offenses like traffic violations.\par \par \uc2 In January, administration officials announced a measure that would make it easier for Americans who are married to illegal immigrants to gain legal residence for their spouses. Although it awakened great hopes -- there are hundreds of thousands of couples in that situation -- the measure is making its way through the bureaucracy and will probably not take effect before November.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Mr. Obama's record on deportations has not been matched since the 1950s, with nearly 400,000 foreigners removed in each year of his term.\par \par \uc2 ''People are saying, 'What gives?' '' said Clarissa Martinez de Castro, director of immigration issues for the National Council of La Raza, or N.C.L.R., the nation's largest Latino civil rights organization. ''Immigration is deeply personal for many of our voters, and there is disillusionment out there.''\par \par \uc2 Hispanics tend to have low rates of voter registration. Polls show that they place a higher priority on jobs and education than on immigration. But many Hispanic immigrants have family or friends who are here illegally.\par \par \uc2 Despite his immigration results, Mr. Obama enjoys a wide lead over Mr. Romney among Hispanics. A recent Gallup poll, based on nationwide telephone interviews conducted from May 14 to June 3, found that Hispanic voters favored Mr. Obama over Mr. Romney by 67 percent to 26 percent. In the 2008 and 2010 elections, Latinos mobilized late but in large numbers against Republicans who took a hard line against immigration, handing victories to Mr. Obama and other Democrats in closely contested states.\par \par \uc2 This year, Mr. Obama's supporters are warning, it may be much harder to prompt that late turnout, even though many Latinos have been dismayed by attacks on illegal immigrants by Mr. Romney and other candidates in the Republican presidential primary race.\par \par \uc2 ''There is ambivalence about the president, where there really should be none,'' said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 During Mr. Obama's first two years, he leaned hard on enforcement, seeking to build credibility with Republicans to attract their votes for an immigration overhaul. But with the economy lagging and millions of Americans out of jobs, Republicans backed away from proposals that would aid illegal immigrants. In 2010, they rebuffed a bid by Mr. Obama to pass the Dream Act, a bill to give legal status to students who are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Since then, the administration has tried to soften the impact of deportations on communities by focusing on expelling criminals. But the effect has been limited.\par \par \uc2 ''I do believe the administration has the right intention, prioritizing deportations,'' Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a leading Democrat on immigration issues, said after seeing the low figures from the deportations review. ''But these abysmal numbers raise serious questions about whether the Department of Homeland Security is making that vision a reality.''\par \par \uc2 The White House defends its programs for Latinos, saying they go far beyond immigration. On Saturday, senior administration officials gathered in Arlington, Va., for the latest in a series of town-hall-style meetings the White House organized with local Hispanic leaders to discuss jobs, education and health, as well as immigration. Also, Cecilia Munoz, the White House domestic policy council director, has made it clear that the administration will try to blame Republicans for Mr. Obama's failure to pass his immigration overhaul.\par \par \uc2 Democratic leaders are saying that is not enough. Mr. Menendez called on the administration to expand the reviews to stop deportations of many more immigrants who are close relatives of citizens. Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, said prosecutors should give work permits to immigrants who are allowed to remain here under their case reviews.\par \par \uc2 Students who would be eligible for legal status under the Dream Act are demanding that Mr. Obama grant them a general reprieve from deportation. One group of students staged a sit-in protest last week at the Obama campaign office in Denver.\par \par \uc2 Latino leaders are worried. Ms. Martinez de Castro said, ''Our immigration policy cannot continue to be at war with our beliefs and our needs.''\par \par \uc2 Audience members listened to President Obama speak in El Paso last year about his push for an immigration overhaul.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 THE desire of the world's have-nots for a more prosperous and secure life in Western Europe informs two films -- Emanuele Cialese's ''Terraferma'' and the twin brothers Massimiliano and Gianluca De Serio's first feature, ''Seven Acts of Mercy'' -- in the Film Society of Lincoln Center's series OPEN ROADS: NEW ITALIAN CINEMA. The series, which began on Friday and continues through Thursday at the Walter Reade Theater, showcases the latest in contemporary Italian movies.\par \par \uc2 In ''Terraferma,'' set on a small island off the coast of Sicily, a fisherman and his 20-year-old grandson violate directions from the coast guard and rescue an Ethiopian boy and his pregnant mother from drowning and give them shelter. But once they are safe and the mother has given birth, will they report them to authorities?\par \par \uc2 The main characters who connect in ''Seven Acts of Mercy'' are a Romanian girl who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  desperate to certify a legal identity and a frail old Italian man who is completely dependent on others for his survival. The movie, filmed in a semidocumentary style, is both a religious parable and a grim reflection of Eastern European immigration to the West.

Happily, she's back, though she may be feeling even a tad darker. In Ms. Gionfriddo's latest play, ''Rapture, Blister, Burn,'' she considers the feelings of disillusionment that often afflict the post-40 set.\par \par \uc2 As she put it in an essay on the \uc2 Playwrights Horizons\uc2  Web site, ''Rapture'' looks at a time in life when ''big, unfulfilled dreams are still possible, but they're statistically less likely.'' She added, ''If you're going to take a big leap and remake yourself, you have to do it now.'' (Another essay by Ms. Gionfriddo appears on Page 4.)\par \par \uc2 In the play two former graduate school friends, played by Amy Brenneman and Kellie Overbey, reunite after a dozen years and after going in divergent directions; one is a respected academic and the other a homemaker. As each considers -- and envies -- the road not taken, Ms. Gionfriddo turns her insightful eye toward gender politics today. In previews, opens Tuesday, closes June 24, \uc2 Playwrights Horizons\uc2 ' Mainstage Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, playwrightshorizons.org; $70.\par \par \uc2 IF LARRY KEIGWIN were a writer, it's easy to imagine him as a poet like Walt Whitman or Frank O'Hara, someone fond of wandering city streets, peering into windows, studying the gaits of passers-by, endlessly curious about the quirks of human behavior. Whitman and O'Hara might be inspired to write poems about city rambling. But Mr. Keigwin creates dances about urban life for his Keigwin + Company that fuse pop culture and high art. He'll be presenting four at the Joyce Theater, two of them world premieres.\par \par \uc2 ''Twelve Chairs,'' which explores states of rejection and survival, is based on a simple but potent structural idea: the game of musical chairs. Competition is also a theme of the other premiere, ''Contact Sport,'' a male quartet that uses athletic movements to suggest the ever-changing relationships among four brothers. The program includes a revised version of the playful ''Trio,'' which received its premiere last fall, and a revival of ''Megalopolis'' (2009), a big work blending futuristic visions with nightclub camp, a mash-up of minimalism and hip-hop. 7:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, 8 p.m. Thursday to Saturday, 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. next Sunday, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; from $10.\par \par \uc2 THIS week brings an exhibition that resembles few previously seen in New York in terms of size, scope and subject. ''CARIBBEAN: CROSSROADS OF THE WORLD'' will be spread among three museums: El Museo del Barrio (opening on Tuesday), which initiated its organization; the Studio Museum in Harlem (Thursday); and the Queens Museum of Art (next Sunday).\par \par \uc2 It will present more than 400 works by some 350 artists, and will survey the cultural contribution of the Caribbean and its diaspora, from the Haitian Revolution of 1804 to the present in six thematic sections (two each museum) that weave together art and history. The artists include scores who were born and remained in the region, and others who relocated; European and Americans who emigrated there; others who visited; and still others for whom the Caribbean was an ancestral home or simply a place of the imagination. A mere sampling -- Camille Pissarro, William Blake, Winslow Homer, Hector Hyppolite, Wifredo Lam, Armando Reveron, Clementine Hunter, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and Jean-Michel Basquiat -- promises an ambitious effort that, regardless of any flaws, should astound. Information: elmuseo.org.\par \par \uc2 THE NORTHSIDE FESTIVALis building into something between South by Southwest -- daytime seminars about entrepreneurship and, next week, a film festival -- and a typical Brooklyn music weekend: bands playing all over. The bands are mostly local, including Caveman and Frankie Rose on Friday at Music Hall of Williamsburg, and Asobi Seksu on Saturday at Brooklyn Bowl. But the lineup boasts rarer events too. The rapper GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan brings two performances of his 1995 album, ''Liquid Swords,'' backed by a live band, Grupo Fantasma, to Music Hall of Williamsburg on Thursday. .\par \par \uc2 On Friday two word-loving, style-hopping indie rockers -- Of Montreal and Jens Lekman -- headline at Williamsburg Park. The Tuareg rockers Tinariwen and the math-rock duo Buke and Gase share a bill on Friday night at Warsaw. The Olivia Tremor Control, whose wistfully psychedelic songs made them college-radio favorites in the 1990s, continue a leisurely reunion Saturday night at the Music Hall of Williamsburg. A pass to visit multiple clubs (subject to capacity) is $86.64 until Wednesday and $102.47 once the festival starts on Thursday.

But this week she makes one guy really work for the privilege of having her as a guest. He is the chef ROBERT IRVINE, and on Wednesday evening at 10, 9 Central time, his ''Restaurant: Impossible'' show on the Food Network offers a ''White House Edition.'' Mr. Irvine's usual job on the show is to give troubled restaurants a makeover, but he is not doing the same for the White House kitchen. His challenge, issued by Mrs. Obama, is to renovate a community center in Washington run by Horton's Kids, a nonprofit group whose services include tutoring and providing healthy meals to children.\par \par \uc2 Before Mr. Irvine's arrival, those meals have to be eaten outside for lack of space. ''I need you to fix that,'' Mrs. Obama tells him. She also wants him to upgrade the kitchen and find somewhere to put a community garden. (Her new book is ''American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America.'') Coolest touch: a kid-powered watering system for that garden using a rain barrel and a stationary bicycle.\par \par \uc2 JUNE has become a dependable time for grass-roots new-music initiatives. On Tuesday the East Village collective INCUBATOR ARTS PROJECT opens June Days, a five-concert series that offers familiar faces in novel settings. The series begins on Tuesday with two intrepid keyboardists, Kathleen Supove and Wil Smith, playing a Paula Matthusen piece for extracted piano frame. Chris McIntyre, a composer and trombonist, introduces a new project on Thursday. And on Saturday the guitarist James Moore plays John Zorn's compendium of fractious virtuosity, ''The Book of Heads.'' 8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday through Sunday, Incubator Arts Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, incubatorarts.org; $12 in advance, $15 at door.\par \par \uc2 Throughout his career the composer PHILIP GLASS has been an avid collaborator and an eager promoter of emerging artists. ''Philip Glass: Music With Friends,'' a three-evening series, finds him in both modes. Wednesday's collaboration with Stephin Merritt, a droll singer and songwriter, is a likely high point; Friday's meeting with Laurie Anderson, a sure bet. 8 p.m., Wednesday through Friday, Issue Project Room, 22 Boerum Place, Downtown Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org; $85 Wednesday and Thursday, $150 Friday.\par \par \uc2 WITH a new book out and her husband's re-election campaign under way MICHELLE OBAMA seems to be turning up a lot on television these days.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- They are the sort of bills that, once upon a time in Washington, passed easily: money for highways and students, protection for battered women.\par \par \uc2 But in this Congressional climate, it seems unlikely that all or even any of these stalled measures will be enacted before the July 4th recess -- an ominous sign for the much harder work of preventing an entire fiscal unraveling at the end of the year. Crisis looms, because crisis is all Washington can do these days.\par \par \uc2 Members of Congress are increasingly worried about the lame-duck session after the election, one replete with expiring tax provisions and onerous budget cuts that are increasingly becoming known as the ''fiscal cliff.'' But there is also a policy precipice at the end of June, when two important programs will expire if Republicans and Democrats cannot find a way to compromise on them.\par \par \uc2 ''There is frustration among a bipartisan group,'' said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire. ''There are an awful lot of red states that need transportation funding, too.''\par \par \uc2 Even more remarkably, the two parties are at an impasse on a formerly benign measure that has routinely passed with near unanimous bipartisan support, one that protects women from domestic violence.\par \par \uc2 With both chambers set to recess for a Fourth of July holiday, on top of the House being out all of next week and senators once again racing for the region's airports on Thursday afternoon, it is becoming hard to see how a spate of deals will be done.\par \par \uc2 Absent such action, come July 1, millions of college students will see the interest rates on their federally subsidized loans double to 6.8 percent, and highway financing will again be in jeopardy. The measure that helps protect women would leave uncertainty about future funding for its programs.\par \par \uc2 The mood on Capitol Hill was sizzling with partisan rancor this week, particularly after an article on Politico suggested that Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and majority leader, had declared 2012 legislation more or less finished.\par \par \uc2 Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader, took to the Senate floor to berate Mr. Cantor, although there was no actual quotation in the article to point to, for saying ''out loud what every Republican on Capitol Hill has been thinking all along -- they care more about winning elections than creating jobs.''\par \par \uc2 Over in the House, a spokeswoman for Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican whip, said on Twitter that the House would be voting ''well after Harry Reid's bedtime.'' Ouch. And Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, hinted Thursday that the highway bill would remain unresolved, and that a six-month extension might be in the offing.\par \par \uc2 The failure of Congress to reach agreement has serious implications for road projects, families with college-age children and women who use shelters and other legal services.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a major concern for us and our students,'' said Diane Stemper, the director of student financial aid at Ohio State University, where 57 percent of the undergraduates have federal student loans. ''Our students on average are graduating with $20,000 in debt.''\par \par \uc2 In New Hampshire, sections of an expansion of Interstate 93 have already been delayed because the state waited to issue bonds because of uncertainty over a clear revenue stream from Washington, said Cliff Sinnott, the executive director of the Rockingham Planning Commission.\par \par \uc2 The summer impasse also presages tough days ahead for both parties charged with resolving far more controversial tax and spending matters before the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 ''These things should be pretty easy,'' said Representative Jo Ann Emerson, Republican of Missouri. ''I think it all depends now on what happens with the election. And I hate to say that because the fact is we have the responsibility to get our work done and we need to get it done, and I would hope that everyone acts like adults and we do the work we need to do.''\par \par \uc2 In the case of each piece of legislation, members of both parties agree on the essential details. With the exception of a handful of very conservative Republicans in both chambers, a majority of members agree that student loan rates should not increase, but the parties are tied in knots over how to cover the $6 billion price tag for doing so.\par \par \uc2 Republicans and Democrats have volleyed some different ideas back and forth over the last week -- late Thursday, Mr. Reid proposed two ways to shore up private pensions and generate more tax revenues as a means to pay for the loan rate extension, While there seemed to be some signs of movement, no deal seemed in the immediate offing.\par \par \uc2 While the Senate has passed a bipartisan transportation bill, the House has rejected it, because it does not offer the streamlining and program consolidation Republicans seek. The House bill has provisions for the next phase of the Keystone XL pipeline and a measure concerning coal ash. The two sides appear at loggerheads. ''The Tea Party is holding up a major transportation bill,'' Ms. Shaheen said.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, the Senate passed a Violence Against Women Act, and the House has its own version that removes Senate provisions like those that would subject non-Indian suspects of domestic violence to prosecution before tribal courts for crimes allegedly committed on reservations and expand the number of temporary visas for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  victims of domestic violence. This bill that once passed by voice vote seems hopelessly stalled.\par \par \uc2 ''It's always frustrating, ''said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, ''that's part of the legislative life up here -- always has been. This is an election year, and not many things happen in an election year.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120609e86900069\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc52}{\*\bkmkend toc52}\b \uc2 Students Press for Action on Immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON   \par \uc2 859 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 May 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Young illegal immigrants, saying President Obama has done little to diminish the threat of deportations they face despite repeated promises, have started a campaign to press him to use executive powers to allow them to remain legally in the country.\par \par \uc2 The campaign is led by the United We Dream Network, the largest organization of young immigrants here illegally who would be eligible for legal status under a proposal in Congress known as the Dream Act.\par \par \uc2 The young people are among the most visible activists in a growing immigrant movement. Their push to focus pressure on the White House reflects deep frustration with Congress for its lack of action on the legislation and with the administration for continuing to deport \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, although Mr. Obama says he supports them.\par \par \uc2 This week student leaders presented White House officials with a letter signed by more than 90 immigration law professors who argued that the president has ''clear executive authority'' to halt deportations of illegal immigrants who might benefit from the student legislation. The professors, from universities across the country, pointed to several measures the president could take under existing laws to defer deportations and permit young immigrants to stay temporarily.\par \par \uc2 On May 17 the students held small-scale actions to publicize their demands in 19 locations around the country, including at the Obama re-election campaign offices in Miami. Gaby Pacheco, a leader of the student network, said Wednesday that they were preparing larger protests for mid-June if the White House did not respond.\par \par \uc2 ''They say all the time that Dreamers shouldn't be deported,'' Ms. Pacheco said, referring to the young immigrants. ''We've heard a lot of talk, but we have not seen action.''\par \par \uc2 The students' escalating actions could be a problem for Mr. Obama, who is counting on strong support from Latino voters to win again in several states that supported him in 2008, particularly Colorado, Florida, Nevada and New Mexico. Polls show very high support among Latinos for some version of the Dream Act, including 91 percent in the 2011 National Survey of Latinos from the Pew Hispanic Center.\par \par \uc2 The law professors' letter, which reads like a legal brief, was intended as a response to administration officials who have said Mr. Obama does not have the authority to issue a reprieve for large groups of illegal immigrants. One measure they cite was used by President Jimmy Carter to admit thousands of Cubans to the United States in 1980, during the mass exodus known as the Mariel boatlift.\par \par \uc2 ''We did not want doubt about the president's legal authority to muddy the waters of the debate,'' said Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was an author of the letter.\par \par \uc2 Young illegal immigrants say they are impatient because each year more of them graduate from high school and cannot attend college because of high tuition rates and barriers to financial aid they face because of their status. More recently, students who did attend college are graduating and facing larger obstacles because they cannot legally work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not a question of whether the president can or can't, '' said Lorella Praeli, 23, a student from Peru here illegally who also is a leader of the immigrant student network. ''It's a question of whether he will or he won't.''\par \par \uc2 Administration officials said this week that Mr. Obama was not likely to take sweeping action on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students before the election. Officials fear an angry reaction from Republicans in Congress, who have warned the White House against what they see as an amnesty by fiat. The officials fear Republican opposition would ruin any chance for future legislation.\par \par \uc2 In a speech this month at an immigration forum in Washington, Cecilia Munoz, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, referred to more limited actions Mr. Obama had already taken to avoid deporting students. ''It is unreasonable to expect that these tools, no matter how faithfully applied, can fix what is broken about our immigration system,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 A senior administration official added on Wednesday, ''The main focus needs to be on Congress, because only legislation they pass can provide Dream students with a permanent solution, which is what they deserve.''\par \par \uc2 The current proposal of the Dream Act would give legal status to foreign-born high school graduates who came to the United States illegally as children, if they complete two years of college or military service. Mr. Obama pushed Congress to pass the legislation in 2010. It passed the House but was blocked by Republicans in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Opposition to the measure has since grown among Republicans, and the party's presumptive presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, has said he would veto some versions of it.\par \par \uc2 Last month Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said he was preparing a new bill that would give temporary status to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, but might not include a path to citizenship. Details of Mr. Rubio's proposal remain unclear because he has not yet submitted a written bill.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120531e85v0006v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The motto of the World Chess Federation is ''Gens una sumus,'' which is Latin for ''We are one family.'' The stories of two boys show how chess can live up to that lofty ideal, or fall short.\par \par \uc2 One of the boys, Fahim Mohammad, 11, won the French national championship for boys under 12 last month. Fahim and his family, originally from Bangladesh, arrived in France and sought to become legal residents, but they were turned down. They struggled to survive and were often taken in by members of the Creteil Chess Club.\par \par \uc2 The Mohammads were ordered deported in 2010 but remained in the country illegally. But after Fahim won the championship, the family's immigration status became public and the effort to allow them to stay in France legally became a cause celebre.\par \par \uc2 Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on May 4 that the case of the young champion and his family deserved to be reviewed, regardless of what happened in the election two days later. Though Fillon's government was voted out of power, the Mohammads were given temporary legal residency on May 11 as a step toward making them citizens, and Fahim will represent France at the European Youth Chess Championship.\par \par \uc2 In the other story, Mohamed Hamida, a 10-year-old Tunisian, forfeited his eighth-round match at the World School Individual Chess Championship this month rather than play Roei Sassoon of Israel.\par \par \uc2 Ynetnews, an Israeli news service, reported that Mohamed was protesting Israel's policies toward the Palestinians.\par \par \uc2 Boycotts of Israeli chess players are nothing new. In October, an Iranian grandmaster refused to play an Israeli in a tournament in Corsica and was expelled.\par \par \uc2 At the U.S. Championship\par \par \uc2 This year's United States Championship has featured a number of decisive games. A rising star, Robert Hess of New York, has struggled, but his victory over Gregory Kaidanov in Round 6 was entertaining.\par \par \uc2 The first 14 moves were the same as the ones in Game 4 of the World Chess Championship now being played in Moscow between Viswanathan Anand and Boris Gelfand. Kaidanov deviated from that game when he played 15 Rae1 instead of 15 h3.\par \par \uc2 Hess sacrificed his queen with 20 ... Nh7, but he did not have to. He could have played 20 ... g6, and he had a clear advantage after 21 Bg6 fg6 22 Nd6 Rg5. Still, Hess did get three pieces for the queen and a pawn.\par \par \uc2 Kaidanov did not play 26 Rd3 because after 26 ... Rd3 27 Qd3 Bh2, Hess would have won his queen. Kaidanov would also have lost his queen if the game had continued 33 Rd4 Rd4 34 Qd4 Ne2. He resigned after 33 ... Bd3 because he had to play 34 Rd3 to avoid losing his queen, and Hess would have had a big material edge after 34 ... Nd3.\par \par \uc2 DIAGRAMS   \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120520e85k00098\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Only a day after calling a special session and urging the Alabama Legislature to make more changes to the state's immigration enforcement law than the modest ones they had passed, Gov. Robert Bentley on Friday signed the bill into law anyway.\par \par \uc2 The governor's decision was arguably the quickest of several reversals that have taken place in recent weeks as politicians in Montgomery, the capital, debated the need for changes to Alabama's immigration enforcement law, considered the strictest and most sweeping in the country.\par \par \uc2 The Legislature had seemed poised just weeks earlier to pass a bill that would make a number of changes to the original law that were intended to address complaints by business groups, local law enforcement officials and legal Alabama residents.\par \par \uc2 But in the last few days of the session, which ended Wednesday, another version of the bill gained steam, one that preserved more of the original law and also added some controversial provisions, like one requiring the state to publish the name of every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who appears in court for a violation of state law.\par \par \uc2 After that bill was passed, Governor Bentley added the immigration law to the list of topics lawmakers were to consider during a special session that began on Thursday. Declining to sign the bill that was passed, Mr. Bentley specifically recommended that they revisit the new provision concerning illegal immigrants in court and a provision from the original law, currently barred by a federal court, that required schools to ascertain the immigration status of enrolling students.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers immediately responded by filing bills nearly identical to the one that passed the day before, only now requiring the state to publish photographs of immigrants in court in addition to their names.\par \par \uc2 Saying that he still had concerns about the law, Governor Bentley acknowledged in a statement that ''the Legislature did not have the appetite for addressing further revisions at this time.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120519e85j0005x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama called a special legislative session on Thursday and urged lawmakers to consider changes to the state's far-reaching immigration enforcement law, less than a day after legislators voted to keep most of that law intact.\par \par \uc2 The passage of the bill on Wednesday, as protesters sang outside the legislative chambers and in several cases were dragged away in handcuffs, was a victory for the most determined supporters of the original law.\par \par \uc2 An earlier version of the bill had dropped some of the more controversial provisions of the law, considered the strictest and most sweeping in the country.\par \par \uc2 But the bill that passed preserved most of the original law and also added new sections, including one requiring the state to publish information, including the person's name, about every case in which an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  appeared in court for any violation of state law.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bentley, a Republican, did not sign it, however, and instead called the special session. But judging from the bills filed on Thursday, the first day of the session, agreement may still be hard-fought.\par \par \uc2 The law remains generally popular in the state but has drawn criticism from civil rights groups, church leaders, local law enforcement officials, state business groups and some Alabama residents who complain of the new rules governing routine transactions.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department has sued Alabama, arguing that the law is unconstitutional, and enforcement of some sections has been temporarily suspended by federal courts. Most of the law is now before the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which is holding off its ruling until the fate of Arizona's immigration enforcement law is decided by the Supreme Court. The justices are expected to issue a ruling by the end of June.\par \par \uc2 Since the Alabama law went into effect last summer, lawmakers have acknowledged what they call ''unintended consequences'' and for months have been discussing the scope and nature of changes to the law.\par \par \uc2 ''We have had meetings with law enforcement, with government agencies, with businesses, with private citizens,'' said State Representative Micky Hammon, a sponsor of the original law. ''And we have had time to see where we could make it more efficient -- less burdensome on our citizens and stronger on lawbreakers.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hammon's proposal, which passed the House in April, addressed some of these complaints and altered some of the provisions that have been challenged as unconstitutional. It also included a measure, backed by business interests, that gave judges some discretion in levying the law's harsh penalties against businesses found to have employed illegal labor.\par \par \uc2 But the other sponsor of the original law, State Senator Scott Beason, introduced his own proposal, which preserved most original sections, including any that are currently barred by federal court. It would still allow law enforcement officials to check immigration status during traffic stops, require schools to check the immigration status of students at enrollment and bar illegal immigrants from renting property.\par \par \uc2 Neither proposal was welcomed by civil rights groups, but Mr. Beason's version was preferred by Tea Party groups and other conservative organizations in the state. To the frustration of some high-ranking Republican lawmakers, what passed on Wednesday amid a flurry of last-minute legislation at the end of the session was very close to Mr. Beason's version.\par \par \uc2 Governor Bentley specifically asked that legislators reconsider one section in the new bill and another in the original one: the new provision that compels the state to list the names of illegal immigrants who appear in court; and the section of the original law, currently barred by a federal court, that requires schools to ascertain immigration status.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, both Mr. Hammon and Mr. Beason filed bills that not only kept the court provision, but added a requirement that the immigrants' photos also be published.\par \par \uc2 Protesters in the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery on Wednesday, when lawmakers supported an immigration law.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- After a fierce fight, full of gender politics, the House passed a Republican bill on Wednesday to combat violence against women, over objections from President Obama and other Democrats, who said it would reduce protections for many battered women, including lesbians, American Indians and illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The 222-to-205 vote clears the way for negotiations with the Senate, which passed a more expansive version last month by a vote of 68 to 31.\par \par \uc2 Some version of the legislation is likely to become law before elections this fall. But first, Democrats said, they want to force the likely Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, to choose between the House bill and the Senate measure, which was approved with support from 15 Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama threatened to veto the House bill. But it passed, with support from 216 Republicans and 6 Democrats. Twenty-three Republicans joined 182 Democrats in voting against the bill.\par \par \uc2 The bill would reauthorize programs operated under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which has provided lifesaving assistance to hundreds of thousands of women. In the past, it was renewed with bipartisan support.\par \par \uc2 Representatives Sandy Adams, Republican of Florida, and Gwen Moore, Democrat of Wisconsin, both said they had experienced domestic violence, but they took radically different positions. Mrs. Adams, a former deputy sheriff in Orange County, is the chief sponsor of the House bill, while Ms. Moore was one of the most outspoken critics.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Adams said Democrats had ''created a phony war on women to score political points.''\par \par \uc2 ''Turning this reauthorization into a political issue is not only wrong,'' she said. ''It is dangerous. We can't allow domestic violence to become a campaign issue.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Moore said that under the bill ''abusers' rights prevail over the rights of the victim,'' and she assailed the measure as ''a direct assault on women's lives.''\par \par \uc2 Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Democrats were exploiting the legislation for political gain, ''instead of working with Republicans to protect women from domestic violence, rape and stalking.''\par \par \uc2 But Democrats said major provisions were opposed by groups representing women, law enforcement officers and churches. The American Bar Association also opposed the House bill, calling it ''a retreat from the battle against domestic and sexual violence.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats said they were dismayed by the House bill, but delighted at the prospect that Republicans would alienate female voters by pushing the legislation in this election year -- after battles over contraception and other issues of concern to women.\par \par \uc2 The House bill omits three provisions of the Senate measure. One would allow Indian tribal courts to try certain non-Indians accused of committing crimes of domestic violence on reservations. Another would expand the number of temporary visas for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  victims of domestic violence. The last would extend protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender victims of domestic violence.\par \par \uc2 Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, said: ''The House bill rolls back protections for battered spouses and victims of serious crimes such as rape and sexual assault. It does so by weakening or repealing provisions that have had near-unanimous support of Democrats and Republicans in years past.''\par \par \uc2 Representative Ruben Hinojosa, Democrat of Texas, said the bill ''shifts power into the hands of abusers.''\par \par \uc2 But Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, said ''it really pains me'' to hear Democrats assert that Republicans do not care about domestic violence.\par \par \uc2 ''We are strengthening the Violence Against Women Act, not weakening it,'' Ms. Foxx said. ''We want to see women served better and money spent better. Our goal is to ensure that more money is spent on direct services and less on administrative bureaucracy.''\par \par \uc2 Representative Lynn Jenkins, Republican of Kansas, said, ''Any attempt to exploit this bill as a partisan political issue is contemptible.''\par \par \uc2 Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said that the bill -- even with last-minute changes by House Republican leaders -- was ''worse than current law.'' It would, he said, make it more difficult for immigrants to obtain visas so they could help law enforcement officials investigate and prosecute domestic violence and similar crimes.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of 31 religious groups, including the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the National Association of Evangelicals and the Episcopal Church, opposed immigration provisions of the House bill.\par \par \uc2 These provisions ''would actually roll back protections in current law for battered noncitizens, making them more vulnerable and, in some cases, endangering their lives,'' the groups said in a letter to House leaders.\par \par \uc2 Democrats tried unsuccessfully to expand protections for gays and lesbians.\par \par \uc2 ''Studies show that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender victims experience domestic violence at roughly the same rate as the general population,'' but they are less likely to receive help, said Representative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado.\par \par \uc2 Republican House members on Wednesday discussing the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, were, from left, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Eric Cantor, Marsha Blackburn, Kristi Noem, Sandy Adams, Jeb Hensarling and Speaker John A. Boehner.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Obama administration officials have announced that a contentious fingerprinting program to identify illegal immigrants will be extended across Massachusetts and New York next week, expanding federal enforcement efforts despite opposition from the governors and immigrant groups in those states.\par \par \uc2 In blunt e-mails sent Tuesday to officials and the police in the two states, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said the program, Secure Communities, would be activated ''in all remaining jurisdictions'' this Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Last June, Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts declined to sign an agreement with the immigration agency to expand Secure Communities beyond a pilot program in the Boston area since 2006. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said he wanted to suspend the program, which had already been initiated in a number of counties.\par \par \uc2 Opponents argued that it was an overly wide dragnet that was deporting many illegal immigrants with no criminal histories who were arrested for minor offenses and that it encouraged racial profiling and eroded trust in law enforcement among immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Governors Patrick and Cuomo are Democrats and close allies of President Obama. They made the uncomfortable choice to challenge him on a centerpiece of his immigration policy because of pressure from immigrant and Latino organizations and some local law enforcement officials. The mayor of Boston, Thomas Menino, also a Democrat, became an especially outspoken critic.\par \par \uc2 The governors were caught in a tangle of confusion about states' role in the program that officials from the immigration agency, known as ICE, have since acknowledged they created. After Secure Communities was formally started in 2008, ICE officials gave many states the understanding that participation was voluntary.\par \par \uc2 Last year, officials at the agency said they had determined that they did not require consent from states to start the program. Citing antiterrorism legislation that Congress passed in 2002, the officials canceled agreements they had signed in 40 states and said they would extend the program nationwide by 2013.\par \par \uc2 Under Secure Communities, fingerprints of anyone booked by the local or state police are sent through the F.B.I. to be checked in databases of the Department of Homeland Security which include immigration records. If there is a match, officials at the immigration agency decide whether to issue a detainer, asking the police to hold the person to be picked up by federal agents.\par \par \uc2 ICE officials said that they made changes to respond to state officials' concerns and to focus the program on deporting serious criminals.\par \par \uc2 They said they revised the detainers to clarify that suspected illegal immigrants could be held for only 48 hours. They provided civil rights training for the police in places where the program was started, officials said.\par \par \uc2 A recent change in arrest procedures would decrease detentions of illegal immigrants stopped for speeding or driving without a license, the officials said.\par \par \uc2 ''Secure Communities has proven to be the single most valuable tool in allowing the agency to eliminate the ad hoc approach of the past and focus on criminal aliens and repeat immigration law violators,'' Barbara Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for ICE, said Friday.\par \par \uc2 ICE officials said they had spoken with officials in New York and Massachusetts, but did not consult on when to expand the program.\par \par \uc2 ''At the end of the day, this is a federal program,'' a Department of Homeland Security official said. ''We have to make our own decisions based on our law enforcement operational needs.''\par \par \uc2 Both governors had measured reactions to the news that the administration had taken a politically fraught decision off their hands.\par \par \uc2 In New York, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said he remained opposed to the program. ''We are monitoring the situation,'' the spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 In Massachusetts, after a young motorcyclist was killed last fall in an accident that the police said was caused by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  driving drunk, Governor Patrick came under fire from county sheriffs and state lawmakers for blocking the program.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Mr. Patrick minimized the practical effect of the program's expansion, saying the state already shares arrest information with federal authorities. He said changes in the program had addressed some of his concerns.\par \par \uc2 But, he added, ''It is very important to me that people not see this as a license to profile.''\par \par \uc2 In an interview Friday, Mayor Menino said he remained staunchly opposed. ''It's dangerous to target immigrants when you are trying to build a community,'' he said. ''The information gets put into a computer and sent to Washington and the wrong person gets deported.\par \par \uc2 ''I want to make this city work,'' he said, ''and to have the feds come in and tell me you have to do this or to do that is just wrong.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120512e85c0004s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and expand its reach to American Indians and homosexuals, after Republicans opted to sidestep an expected partisan brawl.\par \par \uc2 But a political fight still looms when the House takes up a version of the legislation next month that is shorn of the hot-button issues added in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 The final vote, 68 to 31, including 15 Republicans, belied the partisan maneuvering that preceded Senate action on the bill, which extended landmark legislation first passed in 1994 to give courts and law enforcement new tools to combat domestic violence.\par \par \uc2 The latest version -- the third reauthorization since 2000 -- followed tradition and was drafted by a Democrat, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, and a Republican, Senator Michael D. Crapo of Idaho. But it ran into a wall of Republican opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and cleared the committee in February without a Republican vote.\par \par \uc2 Amid partisan brawls over abortion and contraception, some Democrats saw the Violence Against Women Act as the next battle in what they framed as a Republican ''war on women.'' But Senate Republicans did not rise to the bait. Republican senators like John Cornyn of Texas made clear their concerns, but even before amendments to address those concerns were voted on, many of the same senators who had expressed reservations signaled that they would vote for the bill, regardless of whether it was changed. No Republicans spoke out against it before the final tally.\par \par \uc2 ''I intend to vote for the underlying bill even with its flaws,'' Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas announced even as she pressed for changes, including one that would limit advertising on Backpage.com, a Web site that has an ''adult services'' section.\par \par \uc2 If there are to be fireworks, they will have to come when the Senate version comes up against the House's. House Republican women this week announced that they would introduce a version of the violence act when they return from next week's recess, with a final House vote expected by mid-May.\par \par \uc2 The House bill is likely to be stripped of three provisions that have incensed some conservatives. One would subject non-Indian suspects of domestic violence to prosecution before tribal courts for crimes allegedly committed on reservations. Another would expand the number of temporary visas for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  victims of domestic violence. The last would expand Violence Against Women Act protections to gay, bisexual or transgender victims of domestic abuse.\par \par \uc2 ''We're not going to be looking at the controversial issues,'' said Representative Sandy Adams of Florida, who is the main sponsor of the impending House bill.\par \par \uc2 Republicans say the American Indian courts provision could deny due process in some cases and could be ruled unconstitutional. They suggested Democrats were stealthily expanding ''amnesty'' to some illegal immigrants while pursuing pro-homosexual social policy under the guise of domestic violence legislation.\par \par \uc2 Stripping out those provisions, Mr. Leahy responded, ''would result in abandoning some of the most vulnerable victims ... battered immigrants, Native women and victims in same-sex relationships.''\par \par \uc2 Mostly, however, Republican leaders accused Democrats of adding those provisions to the reauthorization expressly to pick a fight for political advantage. But it is unclear how potent those concerns will be. Only 36 senators voted Thursday for the version shorn of those measures.\par \par \uc2 For some conservative groups, however, even the core of the nearly 20-year-old law was unacceptable. The Concerned Women for America and Independent Women's Forum had said the law had devolved into a ''slush fund'' for feminist causes that harms men unfairly and encourages the dissolution of marriages.\par \par \uc2 But from the beginning, many Republicans were declining to take up that cause. The legislation had five Republican co-sponsors, including Mr. Crapo, at its introduction. The two Republican senators facing the toughest re-election races, Dean Heller of Nevada and Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, quickly signed on.\par \par \uc2 Democratic protests aside, the bill's passage was secured well before the final vote was called when eight Republicans signed on as co-sponsors. The final vote was supported not only by moderate Republicans like Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, but also by Republican stalwarts like John McCain of Arizona and unflinching conservatives like David Vitter of Louisiana.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Senator John Cornyn of Texas, left, at a news conference in Washington on Thursday with advocates who work to fight abuse.

(NBC) DATELINE NBC In 2004 4-year-old Sean Goldman was taken from New Jersey to Brazil by his mother, Bruna Bianchi, for what was supposed to be a two-week vacation to her native country. Instead she cut off ties with Sean's biological father, David Goldman (above, with Sean), divorced him and married a lawyer from a prominent family while keeping her son in Brazil. When Sean was 8, Ms. Bianchi died after childbirth, and his stepfather moved to adopt him. This forced Mr. Goldman to fight for Sean's return and set off an international case that lasted until father and son were reunited on Christmas Eve 2009. Sean, now 11, speaks here with Meredith Vieira in his first interview.\par \par \uc2 8 A.M. (IFC) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) In 1995 Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French fashion magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke that left him with a condition called locked-in syndrome, in which he retained vision, hearing and a perfectly functioning mind but was left almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking. In this third feature film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric; Emmanuelle Seigner is Celine, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Josee Croze is the speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. ''The phrase 'triumph of the human spirit' hovers over 'The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,' along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting cliches,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Still, he added, Mr. Schnabel ''demonstrates his own imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.''\par \par \uc2 3:30 P.M. (Flix) JEFFERSON IN PARIS (1995) In this gilded Merchant-Ivory film, with a script by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Nick Nolte channels Thomas Jefferson as an American renaissance man decamped at Versailles. Greta Scacchi is Maria Cosway, the object of his invigorating romance, despite his promise to his dying wife that he would never again marry; Gwyneth Paltrow is his possessive daughter; and Thandie Newton is Sally Hemings, the young slave who probably had several children with him. Reviewing the film in The Times, Janet Maslin wrote that it was ''overshadowed by its own ambition and not-quite-ironic pageantry.''\par \par \uc2 4 P.M. (Sundance) THE MATADOR (2008) As a boy in Granada, Spain, David Fandila, below, would fight imaginary bulls with his mother's dish towels. To his mother's dismay he grew up to confront real bulls, some weighing 1,300 pounds or more. This documentary from Stephen Higgins and Nina Gilden Seavey chronicles Mr. Fandila's quest to reach 100 fights in a single season, a rare achievement. ''Barbaric, elegant, primitive, erotic, revolting, thrilling: the movie, like bullfighting itself, is all of these,'' Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in The Times. ''Blessed with a charismatic leading man, an arcane setting (bullfighting has roots in Roman sacrificial religion) and a narrative steeped in blood and hand-to-hoof combat -- not to mention a triumphant six-bull climax -- the film is a Hemingway fantasy.''\par \par \uc2 8 P.M. (NBC) WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? Armed with his mother's scrapbook, Rob Lowe traces his ancestry from Germany to the United States, where a visit to the Library of Congress reveals a direct connection to the Revolutionary War and George Washington.\par \par \uc2 8:30 P.M. (13) NEED TO KNOW This newsmagazine explores the ways Norfolk, Va., is dealing with flooding caused by a rise in the sea level. Also, an update on last week's investigation into the death of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  after he was beaten and tasered by United States agents.\par \par \uc2 9 P.M. (E!)

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Hundreds of chanting demonstrators filled the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Court on Wednesday, denouncing an Arizona immigration law that was under debate inside, saying it would spread fear among Latinos in the state.\par \par \uc2 Protesters from Latino communities in Arizona, carrying crosses and images of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patroness of Mexico, called on the justices to strike down the disputed provisions of the law, warning that they could unleash a wave of discrimination in the state.\par \par \uc2 But while the protesters, who also included labor and religious groups, denounced the civil rights abuses they said the law would bring, inside the court questions asked by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. early in the arguments clarified that the case did not directly concern racial profiling or other rights claims.\par \par \uc2 The justices heard arguments over a law, known as SB 1070, that Arizona passed in 2010 requiring the police to question people about immigration status if they have a ''reasonable suspicion'' the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . On display inside and outside the court were the widely divergent perceptions of the issues at stake in the legal challenge to Arizona's law between its critics and its proponents.\par \par \uc2 ''The chief justice started off by making it clear this isn't a case about profiling,'' Paul D. Clement, who argued the case for Arizona, said after the hearing. ''It's really a case about pre-emption, and the relationship between the federal law and the state law.'' He was referring to the Obama administration's assertion that the federal government should take precedence over the states on immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 In Washington and around the country, protests against Arizona were far more numerous than public actions in support. Demonstrators in Washington chanted civil rights-era songs, and clergy members in white robes from several faiths led a silent march around the court building.\par \par \uc2 Georgina Sanchez, a protester who came from Phoenix, said families there that included illegal immigrants were worried the court would uphold the law. ''The children live in fear that their parents will not come home one day,'' she told the crowd.\par \par \uc2 But Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, a Republican, emerged from the hearing confident the state would prevail in the court's ruling, which is expected in June.\par \par \uc2 ''I am very, very encouraged that we will get a favorable result,'' she said. She said the justices' questions showed that ''we do have sovereignty and we certainly have states' rights, and we have a responsibility and an obligation to protect our citizens.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Brewer accused the Obama administration of raising racial issues in its challenge to the law for political purposes, ''trying to use that scare card to generate support for the election.''\par \par \uc2 After the hearing, as she was looking for the news media at the base of the court steps, Ms. Brewer instead wandered into the crowd of protesters, who surrounded her for a tense moment, shouting, ''Shame, shame!'' Eventually she found a location to address the news organizations and departed another way.\par \par \uc2 Others who supported Arizona were cheered by the arguments.\par \par \uc2 ''The Justice Department was on the ropes,'' said Kris Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas, a constitutional lawyer who advised Arizona on writing the law. ''They were being pressed by the justices to explain the core weakness of their case, and that is there is no federal statute that conflicts with Arizona's law.''\par \par \uc2 Among demonstrations in at least a dozen cities, in Phoenix on Wednesday protesters marched past the Police Department, the Maricopa County jail and the offices of federal immigration agents. Seven people were arrested outside immigration offices, The Associated Press said. In Boston, several hundred opponents of the Arizona law rallied outside the State House.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers opposing Arizona contended that it was difficult to tell how the justices might decide. But they said other lawsuits have been filed against SB 1070 by civil and immigrant rights organizations, which have not moved forward while the Supreme Court heard the Obama administration's case.\par \par \uc2 Linton Joaquin, general counsel of the National Immigration Law Center, in California, said his group had participated in a lawsuit based directly on civil rights, which is currently in federal district court in Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 ''Our challenge really gets to the discriminatory intent and impact of the law,'' Mr. Joaquin said.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the Supreme Court decides in the current case, the others will still advance, he said.\par \par \uc2 Latino advocates said the legal issues could not be separated from the Arizona law's impact on immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 ''We regard this as the biggest civil rights case of our time,'' said Clarissa Martinez, director of immigration for the National Council of La Raza.\par \par \uc2 ''If the court decides to uphold, without a doubt that would be a call to action for Latinos,'' she said. ''We need to realize that our position in this country is being challenged.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: As the Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday on an Arizona law on police questioning of immigration status, protests against the law were held outside, above, and in Phoenix, at right.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc62}{\*\bkmkend toc62}\b \uc2 Fierce Debate on Arizona Immigration Law on Eve of Supreme Court Hearing\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON; Adam Liptak contributed reporting.   \par \uc2 907 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 April 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- A day before the Supreme Court was to hear arguments on an Arizona statute that expanded the immigration enforcement powers of local police, the author of the law defended it in a Senate hearing under sharp questioning from Democrats, saying it ''removes the political handcuffs from state and local law enforcement.''\par \par \uc2 Russell Pearce, a Republican who is the former president of the Arizona Senate, ventured into hostile terrain in a hearing called by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on immigration. Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, also a Republican, turned down Mr. Schumer's invitation to advocate for the law at the hearing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pearce and Ms. Brewer are in Washington to attend a Supreme Court hearing on Wednesday in which the justices will consider whether four provisions of the law that have been challenged by the Obama administration are unconstitutional because they encroach on legal terrain reserved for the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pearce, known for his blunt language, said the law, SB 1070, would protect the state's citizens from ''the invasion of illegal aliens we face today,'' which he called ''one of the greatest threats to our nation.'' He said Arizona had acted because ''the federal government has decided not to enforce the law,'' and he accused the administration of ''encouraging further lawbreaking'' with its lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 The Senate hearing served primarily to highlight the political jockeying surrounding the Supreme Court's deliberations, as Democrats and Republicans try to gauge the possible impact of a ruling by the justices on Latinos, a pivotal group of voters in the presidential contest.\par \par \uc2 As it appears increasingly possible that the court will uphold at least some of the disputed provisions, Mr. Schumer called the hearing as a showcase for the Democrats' opposition to the law, which has been intensely unpopular among Latinos nationwide. He announced that if the Supreme Court upheld part or all of Arizona's statute in its ruling, which is expected in June, he would introduce a bill to expressly prevent states from enacting their own immigration enforcement laws.\par \par \uc2 Senate staff members said that proposal would have little chance of passage, but it could serve as a rallying point for Democrats to appeal to Latino voters during the summer as the presidential race is fully under way.\par \par \uc2 None of the Republicans on the subcommittee attended the hearing.\par \par \uc2 ''It is no more than election-year theater,'' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the senior Republican on the subcommittee. He said that none of the witnesses was an expert on the arcane legal issues that the Supreme Court is considering about the law.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law requires state law enforcement officials to determine the immigration status of people they stop or arrest if officials have reason to believe they might be illegal immigrants. The law also makes it a crime under state law for immigrants to fail to register under a federal law and for illegal immigrants to work or to try to find work. It also allows the police to make arrests without warrants if they have probable cause to believe that suspects are deportable under federal law.\par \par \uc2 Lower courts have blocked the provisions. The administration has argued to the Supreme Court that the law conflicts with federal policies and priorities. Arizona counters that the law complements federal efforts to control immigration and is a routine example of state enforcement of federal laws.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pearce, a fierce opponent of illegal immigration, wrote the statute, which passed in 2010. Caught in the uproar the law provoked among some voters, especially Latinos, he lost his Senate seat in a recall election last November.\par \par \uc2 Persistent questioning from Mr. Schumer put Mr. Pearce on the defensive at times, as the senator bore down on sections of the bill he said could lead the Arizona police to engage in racial profiling. The senator pointed to a training manual showing that the police were instructed to consider how a person was dressed and whether his vehicle was ''heavily loaded'' in developing a ''reasonable suspicion'' that he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The bitterness that the bill has provoked was on display. Dennis DeConcini, who was a Democratic United States senator from Arizona from 1977 to 1995, issued an apology to Latinos for the ''harm'' of the law. ''I am embarrassed for my state,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Around the country, immigrant advocate organizations were gearing up for protests and vigils. Immigrant groups in Los Angeles held a small rally on Tuesday in front of a federal court building downtown.\par \par \uc2 In a letter released Tuesday afternoon, religious leaders from a number of faiths called on President Obama to ''reassert your authority'' to stop states from enacting a patchwork of immigration laws, by working with Congress to pass a broad federal overhaul of the immigration system. Among those signing were Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; Leith Anderson, president of the National Association of Evangelicals; and the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Russell Pearce, left, a former Arizona lawmaker who wrote the state's immigration bill, testified about it Tuesday at a hearing held by Senator Charles E.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- With Republicans increasingly concerned about losing Hispanic voters this November, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Thursday pressed his party to embrace a compromise measure allowing young illegal immigrants a pathway to legal status.\par \par \uc2 At a meeting with reporters in his Senate office, Mr. Rubio, a rising Republican star considered a leading vice-presidential prospect for Mitt Romney, sought to appeal to the conscience of his party as he laid out the broad parameters of a measure that would not go as far as the Democratic proposal to legalize young illegal immigrants, but would be significantly more permissive than anything most Republican politicians have been willing to accept.\par \par \uc2 ''We have these very talented young people in America who find themselves in limbo through no fault of their own,'' said Mr. Rubio, acknowledging that he has kept the Romney campaign apprised of his actions.\par \par \uc2 ''Mitt Romney is the leader of the Republican Party now. Our hope is to come up with something that he can be supportive of,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The Rubio push comes as Mr. Romney tries to shift from the hard-line stance he took during the primary fight to a softer position that could erode President Obama's overwhelming edge with Hispanic voters.\par \par \uc2 Republican strategists fear Mr. Obama's advantage -- hovering around two-thirds of the Hispanic vote -- could kill Republican chances in crucial states like Colorado and Nevada, swing Virginia to the Democratic column and keep the president's hopes alive in Florida.\par \par \uc2 At a closed-door fund-raiser in Florida overheard by reporters, Mr. Romney acknowledged the jeopardy he faces if that advantage remains.\par \par \uc2 ''We have to get Hispanic voters to vote for our party,'' he told donors, warning that recent polling ''spells doom for us.''\par \par \uc2 The Romney campaign appears to have begun shifting to the center on immigration, after staking out a position to the right of opponents like former Speaker Newt Gingrich and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.\par \par \uc2 During the primary fight, Mr. Romney said he would veto the existing version of the Dream Act, or the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, which would grant illegal immigrants brought into the country as children by their parents a pathway to citizenship. He labeled it a magnet for illegal immigration. And he criticized Mr. Perry for granting young illegal immigrants in-state tuition to Texas universities.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, campaign aides said Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, was not referring to the most draconian portions of Arizona's immigration law when he said during a debate that Arizona could be a model for the nation. He was referring specifically to the ''E-Verify'' measure that requires employers to check the legal status of job applicants electronically.\par \par \uc2 Last weekend, in a comprehensive list of advisers provided to The Boston Globe, the Romney campaign did not include Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and co-author of the Arizona immigration law. During the primary campaign, the Romney campaign had referred to Mr. Kobach as an ''informal adviser.''\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Senator Rubio's prominence as a potential running mate lies in large part because as a Cuban-American he could appeal to Latino voters, especially in his crucial home state. Mr. Rubio again said he did not want the position, although he suggested instead he could be open to higher office in 2016.\par \par \uc2 The Romney campaign reacted cautiously to Mr. Rubio's appeal on the Dream Act.\par \par \uc2 ''Governor Romney will study and consider any proposals on immigration from his Republican partners,'' said Andrea Saul, a campaign spokeswoman. ''We must work together on protecting and strengthening legal immigration, securing our borders, ending illegal immigration in a civil but resolute manner, and ensuring that any reforms do not encourage further illegal immigration.'' As part of his compromise, Mr. Rubio said he favored giving nonimmigrant visas to young illegal immigrants brought into the country by a certain date, who have graduated from high school and have no criminal record. Once the visas are secured, they would be able to work, get an education and decide on their own whether to begin the standard process to become citizens.\par \par \uc2 ''They would have the same rights, no more, no less, than any other nonimmigrant visa holder,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic version of the legislation would create a specific pathway to citizenship through military or community service, effectively giving young illegal immigrants a step up on some legal immigrants. In December 2010, the bill -- which has long garnered bipartisan support -- had 55 votes in support but fell to a filibuster.\par \par \uc2 Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, reintroduced it in the new Congress, but for the first time since it was drafted in 2001 by Mr. Durbin and Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, it had no Republican co-sponsors.\par \par \uc2 Important details of a Rubio version remain unresolved. He said there was broad agreement that military service with an honorable discharge should afford an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  special status in the quest for citizenship. But he has not decided about other avenues of public service.\par \par \uc2 He also does not have an arrival date beyond which young illegal immigrants could not apply for his visa. But he said such details would be worked out with members of both parties, including Senator Durbin, who has been open to talks.\par \par \uc2 Many Republicans are likely to stand in Mr. Rubio's way. Representative Steve King of Iowa, one of the party's strongest voices against illegal immigration, said Congress must first ''re-establish the rule of law'' with illegal immigrants before offering any of them legal status. Mr. Rubio's proposal would simply do the Democrats' political bidding, Mr. King said.\par \par \uc2 Democrats ''see people in this country illegally as undocumented Democrats,'' Mr. King said Thursday. ''Do Republicans engage in that?''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, fielded questions from reporters on Thursday in his office on Capitol Hill.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- Perhaps no law in the past generation has drawn more praise than the drive to ''end welfare as we know it,'' which joined the late-'90s economic boom to send caseloads plunging, employment rates rising and officials of both parties hailing the virtues of tough love.\par \par \uc2 But the distress of the last four years has added a cautionary postscript: much as overlooked critics of the restrictions once warned, a program that built its reputation when times were good offered little help when jobs disappeared. Despite the worst economy in decades, the cash welfare rolls have barely budged.\par \par \uc2 Faced with flat federal financing and rising need, Arizona is one of 16 states that have cut their welfare caseloads further since the start of the recession -- in its case, by half. Even as it turned away the needy, Arizona spent most of its federal welfare dollars on other programs, using permissive rules to plug state budget gaps.\par \par \uc2 The poor people who were dropped from cash assistance here, mostly single mothers, talk with surprising openness about the desperate, and sometimes illegal, ways they make ends meet. They have sold food stamps, sold blood, skipped meals, shoplifted, doubled up with friends, scavenged trash bins for bottles and cans and returned to relationships with violent partners -- all with children in tow.\par \par \uc2 Esmeralda Murillo, a 21-year-old mother of two, lost her welfare check, landed in a shelter and then returned to a boyfriend whose violent temper had driven her away. ''You don't know who to turn to,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Maria Thomas, 29, with four daughters, helps friends sell piles of brand-name clothes, taking pains not to ask if they are stolen. ''I don't know where they come from,'' she said. ''I'm just helping get rid of them.''\par \par \uc2 To keep her lights on, Rosa Pena, 24, sold the groceries she bought with food stamps and then kept her children fed with school lunches and help from neighbors. Her post-welfare credo is widely shared: ''I'll do what I have to do.''\par \par \uc2 Critics of the stringent system say stories like these vindicate warnings they made in 1996 when President Bill Clinton fulfilled his pledge to ''end welfare as we know it'': the revamped law encourages states to withhold aid, especially when the economy turns bad.\par \par \uc2 The old program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, dates from the New Deal; it gave states unlimited matching funds and offered poor families extensive rights, with few requirements and no time limits. The new program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, created time limits and work rules, capped federal spending and allowed states to turn poor families away.\par \par \uc2 ''My take on it was the states would push people off and not let them back on, and that's just what they did,'' said Peter B. Edelman, a law professor at Georgetown University who resigned from the Clinton administration to protest the law. ''It's been even worse than I thought it would be.''\par \par \uc2 But supporters of the current system often say lower caseloads are evidence of decreased dependency. Many leading Republicans are pushing for similar changes to much larger programs, like Medicaid and food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the top House Republican on budget issues, calls the current welfare program ''an unprecedented success.'' Mitt Romney, who leads the race for the Republican presidential nomination, has said he would place similar restrictions on ''all these federal programs.'' One of his rivals, Rick Santorum, calls the welfare law a source of spiritual rejuvenation.\par \par \uc2 ''It didn't just cut the rolls, but it saved lives,'' Mr. Santorum said, giving the poor ''something dependency doesn't give: hope.''\par \par \uc2 President Obama spoke favorably of the program in his 2008 campaign -- promoting his role as a state legislator in cutting the Illinois welfare rolls. But he has said little about it as president.\par \par \uc2 Even in the 1996 program's early days, when jobs were plentiful, a subset of families appeared disconnected -- left with neither welfare nor work. Their numbers were growing before the recession and seem to have surged since then.\par \par \uc2 No Money, No Job\par \par \uc2 While data on the very poor is limited and subject to challenge, recent studies have found that as many as one in every four low-income single mothers are jobless and without cash aid -- roughly four million women and children. Many of the mothers have problems like addiction or depression, which can make assisting them politically unpopular, and they have received little attention in a downturn that has produced an outpouring of concern for the middle class.\par \par \uc2 Poor families can turn to other programs, like food stamps or Medicaid, or rely on family and charity. But the absence of a steady source of cash, however modest, can bring new instability to troubled lives.\par \par \uc2 One prominent supporter of the tough welfare law is worried that it may have increased destitution among the most disadvantaged families. ''This is the biggest problem with welfare reform, and we ought to be paying attention to it,'' said Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution, who helped draft the 1996 law as an aide to House Republicans and argues that it has worked well for most recipients.\par \par \uc2 ''The issue here is, can you create a strong work program, as we did, without creating a big problem at the bottom?'' Mr. Haskins said. ''And we have what appears to be a big problem at the bottom.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''This is what really bothers me: the people who supported welfare reform, they're ignoring the problem.''\par \par \uc2 The welfare program was born amid apocalyptic warnings and was instantly proclaimed a success, at times with a measure of ''I told you so'' glee from its supporters. Liberal critics had warned that its mix of time limits and work rules would create mass destitution -- ''children sleeping on the grates,'' in the words of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who died in 2003.\par \par \uc2 But the economy boomed, employment soared, poverty fell and caseloads plunged. Thirty-two states reduced their caseloads by two-thirds or more, as officials issued press releases and jostled for bragging rights. The tough law played a large role, but so did expansions of child care and tax credits that raised take-home pay.\par \par \uc2 In a twist on poverty politics, poor single mothers, previously chided as ''welfare queens,'' were celebrated as working-class heroes, with their stories of leaving the welfare rolls cast as uplifting tales of pluck. Flush with federal money, states experimented with programs that offered counseling, clothes and used cars.\par \par \uc2 But if the rise in employment was larger than predicted, it was also less transformative than it may have seemed. Researchers found that most families that escaped poverty remained ''near poor.''\par \par \uc2 And despite widespread hopes that working mothers might serve as role models, studies found few social or educational benefits for their children. (They measured things like children's aspirations, self-esteem, grades, drug use and arrests.) Nonmarital births continued to rise.\par \par \uc2 But the image of success formed early and stayed frozen in time.\par \par \uc2 ''The debate is over,'' President Clinton said a year after signing the law, which he often cites in casting himself as a centrist. ''Welfare reform works.''\par \par \uc2 The recession that began in 2007 posed a new test to that claim. Even with $5 billion in new federal funds, caseloads rose just 15 percent from the lowest level in two generations. Compared with the 1990s peak, the national welfare rolls are still down by 68 percent. Just one in five poor children now receives cash aid, the lowest level in nearly 50 years.\par \par \uc2 As the downturn wreaked havoc on budgets, some states took new steps to keep the needy away. They shortened time limits, tightened eligibility rules and reduced benefits (to an average of about $350 a month for a family of three).\par \par \uc2 Since 2007, 11 states have cut the rolls by 10 percent or more. They include centers of unemployment like Georgia, Indiana and Rhode Island, as well as Michigan, where the welfare director justified cuts by telling legislators, ''We have a fair number of people gaming the system.'' Arizona cut benefits by 20 percent and shortened time limits twice -- to two years, from five.\par \par \uc2 Many people already found the underlying system more hassle than help, a gantlet of job-search classes where absences can be punished by a complete loss of aid. Some states explicitly pursue a policy of deterrence to make sure people use the program only as a last resort.\par \par \uc2 Since the states get fixed federal grants, any caseload growth comes at their own expense. By contrast, the federal government pays the entire food stamp bill no matter how many people enroll; states encourage applications, and the rolls have reached record highs.\par \par \uc2 Among the Arizonans who lost their checks was Tamika Shelby, who first sought cash aid at 29 after fast-food jobs and a stint as a waitress in a Phoenix strip club. The state gave her $176 a month and sent her to work part time at a food bank. Though she was effectively working for $2 an hour, she scarcely missed a day in more than a year.\par \par \uc2 ''I loved it,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Her supervisor, Michael Cox, said Ms. Shelby ''was just wonderful'' and ''would even come up here on her days off.''\par \par \uc2 Then the reduced time limit left Ms. Shelby with neither welfare nor work. She still gets about $250 a month in food stamps for herself and her 3-year-old son, Dejon. She counts herself fortunate, she said, because a male friend lets her stay in a spare room, with no expectations of sex. Still, after feeding her roommate and her child, she said, ''there are plenty of days I don't eat.''\par \par \uc2 ''I know there are some people who abuse the system,'' Ms. Shelby said. ''But I was willing to do anything they asked me to. If I could, I'd still be working for those two dollars an hour.''\par \par \uc2 Diverting Federal Funds\par \par \uc2 Clarence H. Carter, Arizona's director of economic security, says finances forced officials to cut the rolls. But the state gets the same base funding from the federal government, $200 million, that it received in the mid-1990s when caseloads were five times as high. (The law also requires it to spend $86 million in state funds.)\par \par \uc2 Arizona spends most of the federal money on other human services programs, especially foster care and adoption services, while using just one-third for cash benefits and work programs -- the core purposes of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. If it did not use the federal welfare money, the state would have to finance more of those programs itself.\par \par \uc2 ''Yes, we divert -- divert's a bad word,'' said State Representative John Kavanagh, a Republican and chairman of the Arizona House Appropriations Committee. ''It helps the state.''\par \par \uc2 While federal law allows such flexibility, critics say states neglect poor families to patch their own finances. Nationally, only 30 percent of the welfare money is spent on cash benefits.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not that the other stuff isn't important, but it's not what T.A.N.F.'' -- the Temporary Assistance program -- ''was intended for,'' said LaDonna Pavetti of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research and advocacy group. ''The states use the money to fill budget holes.''\par \par \uc2 Even in an economy as bad as Arizona's, some recipients find work. Estefana Armas, a 30-year-old mother of three, spent nine years on the rolls, fighting depression so severe that it left her hospitalized. Once exempt from time limits because of her mental health, Ms. Armas joined support groups, earned a high school equivalency degree and enrolled in community college.\par \par \uc2 Just as her time expired last summer, Ms. Armas found work as a teacher's aide at a church preschool.\par \par \uc2 ''It kind of pushed me to get a job,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of Temporary Assistance cite stories like that to argue that it promotes a work ethic. Despite high unemployment, low-skilled single mothers work as much now, on average, as they did under the old welfare law -- and by some measures, a bit more. As a group, their poverty rates are still lower. And those without cash aid, they say, can turn to other programs.\par \par \uc2 ''We have reduced our caseload, and we don't have people dying in the street,'' Mr. Kavanagh said. ''There were an awful lot of people who didn't need it.''\par \par \uc2 But the number of very poor families appears to be growing. Pamela Loprest and Austin Nichols, researchers at the Urban Institute, found that one in four low-income single mothers nationwide -- about 1.5 million -- are jobless and without cash aid. That is twice the rate the researchers found under the old welfare law. More than 40 percent remain that way for more than a year, and many have mental or physical disabilities, sick children or problems with domestic violence.\par \par \uc2 Using a different definition of distress, Luke Shaefer of the University of Michigan and Kathryn Edin of Harvard examined the share of households with children in a given month living on less than $2 per person per day. It has nearly doubled since 1996, to almost 4 percent. Even when counting food stamps as cash, they found one of every 50 children live in such a household.\par \par \uc2 The Census Bureau uses a third measure, ''deep poverty,'' which it defines as living on less than half of the amount needed to escape poverty (for a family of three, that means living on less than $9,000 a year). About 10 percent of households headed by women report incomes that low, a bit less than the peak under the old law but still the highest level in 18 years.\par \par \uc2 Some researchers say the studies exaggerate poverty by inadequately accounting for undisclosed income, like help from boyfriends or under-the-table jobs. They note that asking poor people about their consumption, rather than their income, suggests that even the poorest single mothers have improved their standard of living since 1996.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Haskins, the Temporary Assistance program's architect, agrees that poverty at the bottom ''is not as bad as it seems,'' but adds, ''It's still pretty darn bad.''\par \par \uc2 Trying to Make Do\par \par \uc2 Asked how they survived without cash aid, virtually all of the women interviewed here said they had sold food stamps, getting 50 cents for every dollar of groceries they let others buy with their benefit cards. Many turned to food banks and churches. Nationally, roughly a quarter have subsidized housing, with rents as low as $50 a month.\par \par \uc2 Several women said the loss of aid had left them more dependent on troubled boyfriends. One woman said she sold her child's Social Security number so a relative could collect a tax credit worth $3,000.\par \par \uc2 ''I tried to sell blood, but they told me I was anemic,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Several women acknowledged that they had resorted to shoplifting, including one who took orders for brand-name clothes and sold them for half-price. Asked how she got cash, one woman said flatly, ''We rob wetbacks'' -- illegal immigrants, who tend to carry cash and avoid the police. At least nine times, she said, she has flirted with men and led them toward her home, where accomplices robbed them.\par \par \uc2 ''I felt bad afterwards,'' she said. But she added, ''There were times when we didn't have nothing to eat.''\par \par \uc2 One family ruled out crime and rummaged through trash cans instead. The mother, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, could not get aid for herself but received $164 a month for her four American-born children until their time limit expired. Distraught at losing her only steady source of cash, she asked the children if they would be ashamed to help her collect discarded cans.\par \par \uc2 ''I told her I would be embarrassed to steal from someone -- not to pick up cans,'' her teenage daughter said.\par \par \uc2 Weekly park patrols ensued, and recycling money replaced about half of the welfare check.\par \par \uc2 Despite having a father in prison and a mother who could be deported, the children exude earnest cheer. A daughter in the fifth grade won a contest at school for reading the most books. A son in the eighth grade is a student leader praised by his principal for tutoring younger students, using supplies he pays for himself.\par \par \uc2 ''That's just the kind of character he has,'' the principal said.\par \par \uc2 After losing cash aid, the mother found a cleaning job but lost it when her boss discovered that she was in the United States illegally. The family still gets subsidized housing and $650 a month in food stamps.\par \par \uc2 The boy worries about homelessness, but his younger sisters, 9 and 10, see an upside in scavenging.\par \par \uc2 ''It's kind of fun because you get to look through the trash,'' one of the girls said.\par \par \uc2 ''And you get to play in the park a little while before you go home,'' her sister agreed.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, above, the mother of four American-born children, started redeeming bottles and cans in Phoenix after she lost her $164 monthly aid.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 When restaurant customers learned that the waiter they called Angel was in the hospital with kidney failure, they stuffed bills into a collection jar to help support his family. His brother offered something more precious: a healthy kidney to restore his life.\par \par \uc2 But for two years, the obstacles to the transplant seemed insuperable. Angel, the father of two American-born children, is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . And a maze of conflicting health care and immigration policies meant that while the government would pay for a lifetime of dialysis, costing $75,000 yearly, it would not pay for a $100,000 transplant that would make dialysis unnecessary.\par \par \uc2 Yet Tuesday morning, he and his brother were undergoing the surgery in adjacent operating rooms at Mount Sinai Medical Center. And all the other barriers receded in importance as doctors swabbed bare skin with antiseptic and prepared to cut.\par \par \uc2 The brothers had hugged when they met at 4 a.m. at a subway station in Brooklyn for the trip to Mount Sinai, in Upper Manhattan. Now, under the cool green lights of one operating room, the healthy brother was covered with blue sterile drapes, and his flesh was pierced with the tools of laparoscopic surgery, computer monitors showing an inner human landscape of pulsing blood vessels and vital organs.\par \par \uc2 In the second operating room, Angel, a small man in his 30s who had dwindled to 115 pounds during years of shuttling between work and dialysis, was soon draped too. Only his exposed abdomen and the beep of the heart monitor marked his living presence when the masked team prepared to slice and sew.\par \par \uc2 Angel's quest for a transplant was chronicled in a Dec. 21 article in The New York Times about a paradox in health care rules. In New York, Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor, covers the cost of dialysis, considering it an emergency measure, regardless of whether the patient is a legal resident of the United States. But while a transplant is far cheaper in the long run, that procedure is covered by Medicare, which does not extend to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The article drew more than 600 comments online, many expressing anger at illegal immigrants or frustration at the impasse in national immigration and health care policies. Others called for compassion and asked where they could send donations. About $14,000 from readers was collected with the help of Randye Retkin, a health lawyer at the New York Legal Assistance Group.\par \par \uc2 ''I feel like I have such a good life, such a fortunate life,'' said one donor, Lorraine Quitman, a teacher. ''It just seemed inequitable that he should be denied a full life, just because of money.''\par \par \uc2 A wealthy Texas rancher pledged $75,000, which he felt should be enough to pay the whole cost of the operation. But it was not enough, and the confusion that reigns over health care costs, combined with philanthropic complications, almost derailed everything.\par \par \uc2 Mount Sinai, one of the world's leading transplant centers, had originally set the price for the operation at $200,000 in advance, to cover any possible postoperative complications; it lowered that to $150,000, given the youth and health of the brothers, but barred further reductions as a slippery slope to unaffordable demands for uncompensated care.\par \par \uc2 Leona Kim-Schluger, a surgeon and the associate director of Mount Sinai's Recanati/Miller Transplant Institute, had been trying to help Angel and refused to give up. In February, at her request, a former patient from Florida sent $75,000, to match the Texan's pledge. But the Texan dropped out, irritated that what he called ''legal aid'' was collecting the donations, he said, and upset that the operation was going to cost more than it would at a Texas hospital where he is a trustee.\par \par \uc2 North Shore University Hospital volunteered to consider the brothers for a transplant and to absorb the cost. Angel, who like his brother did not want to be fully identified for fear of provoking immigration authorities, was grateful for North Shore's offer, but decided not to start all over with tests there while doctors at Mount Sinai were still trying.\par \par \uc2 In the end, Dr. Kim-Schluger raised an additional $18,000 from an anonymous donor, and after much soul-searching, the hospital agreed to do the surgery for $100,000, the Medicare rate.\par \par \uc2 It was done by teams with years of experience, as diverse as the city itself. Dr. Juan Pablo Rocca, a native of the Patagonia region of Argentina, maneuvered tiny tools that cut and cauterized at the same time, separating the healthy kidney from connective tissue in several hours of painstaking work.\par \par \uc2 He unfurled a special zip-lock bag inside the brother's abdomen, first enveloping the kidney, and only then cutting it free from the blood supply and the bladder, and pulling the bagged organ through a small incision into the waiting hands of Dr. Sander S. Florman, the director of the transplant institute.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Florman, who grew up in Louisville, Ky., carried the kidney, cleaned and cooled, to the second operating theater, where a surgical technician born in Haiti was deftly reordering an array of scalpels, syringes and sutures.\par \par \uc2 In a safety ritual, a nurse from the Philippines called ''time out,'' invoking the patient's name, birth date and blood type, and the organ he was about to receive.\par \par \uc2 The goal was to connect the kidney to the recipient's blood flow in less than 45 minutes. It took 30.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a winner!'' Dr. Florman exulted, as the kidney turned rosy and immediately worked in a spurt of urine from the ureter, which would momentarily be connected to the patient's bladder. ''Life is good.''\par \par \uc2 Angel's brother went home on Thursday, Angel on Friday. He will eventually be seen at Bellevue Hospital Center for aftercare, including the antirejection drugs he will need lifelong.\par \par \uc2 ''It has nothing to do with legal or illegal,'' said Dr. Kim-Schluger, whose mother escaped North Korea as a child and brought the family to the United States via South Korea, British Guyana and Jamaica. She went to Catholic school in New York, married a descendant of Eastern European Jewish immigrants and converted to Judaism. She said Angel was on her mind as she prepared Passover Seder.\par \par \uc2 ''Yes, there are hundreds and hundreds of people like this,'' she said. ''But this is the one who knocked on our door.''\par \par \uc2 Angel expressed deep gratitude to the doctors and all the donors. Then, having seen his shy younger brother smile through pain the day after surgery, he reflected that some gifts are beyond thanks.\par \par \uc2 ''There's no price to pay him back,'' he said. ''But I'm always going to be there for him.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: April 10, 2012, Tuesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who received a kidney from his brother, with help from people including donors and doctors at Mount Sinai, misstated the timing of a former patient's contribution of $75,000. It was in February, not in March.\par \par \uc2 Correction: April 11, 2012, Wednesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  whose brother donated a kidney to him described part of the procedure incorrectly. The ureter -- not the urethra -- was connected to the patient's bladder.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Dr. Sander S. Florman, above left, and Dr. Eric Davis, right, transplanted a kidney to a man called Angel at Mount Sinai Medical Center on Tuesday. Left, Angel reached out to his brother after the operation.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA -- Nearly a year after enacting an immigration law that supporters describe as the toughest in the country, Alabama is considering major revisions to its immigration policies.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, a sponsor of the law, State Representative Micky Hammon, proposed eliminating or altering several of its most controversial sections. The law, which enhances police authority to deal with illegal immigrants, is popular with most Alabamians but faced a backlash from civil liberties advocates and business leaders.\par \par \uc2 The law's supporters said the changes would make it clearer, easier to enforce and less susceptible to legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 ''The essence of the law will not change,'' said Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican. ''Anyone living and working in Alabama must be here legally.''\par \par \uc2 The new bill would remove a requirement that public schools check the residency of new students and that illegal immigrants be barred from public colleges. Both provisions had already been put on hold by federal courts.\par \par \uc2 It would also eliminate a provision that makes renting property to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  the same as harboring one. And it would require the police to ask about immigration status only after an arrest or traffic citation, not at any legal stop.\par \par \uc2 But the penalty for companies caught hiring illegal immigrants would be increased: Their business licenses would be suspended for 60 days instead of 10 days.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's law has faced legal challenges. In September, a federal judge upheld most provisions but blocked others. On April 25, the United States Supreme Court will hear arguments about a similar immigration law in Arizona, and the court is expected to rule by June on its constitutionality. That ruling could affect immigration laws in Alabama, Georgia, Utah and other states.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hammon's proposal to change Alabama's law upset fervent supporters.\par \par \uc2 ''Why not just wait for the Supreme Court ruling to settle a lot of these issues conclusively?'' asked Ira Mehlman, media director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocacy groups said the changes did not go far enough. They expressed concern about a new provision that allows police officers who issue traffic citations to check the immigration status not only of the vehicle's driver but also its passengers.\par \par \uc2 Still, immigrant advocates like Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, said states were becoming more cautious. Last week, lawmakers in Mississippi decided not to pass an immigration bill similar to Alabama's.\par \par \uc2 ''So in the Southeast this week, we have one state not passing a law and another revisiting its law,'' Ms. Jacoby said.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- The impact of steep declines in the number of migrants illegally crossing the border with Mexico in recent years has rippled across Arizona and other border states, with federal and local law enforcement seeing big drops in crime related to illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, federal agents have found far fewer drop houses, where smugglers stash border crossers. Police chiefs in Arizona cities say their crime rates are low and are falling, along with the numbers and costs of illegal immigrants coming through their jails.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials met with state and local police departments on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Border Security Expo in the convention hall in downtown Phoenix. They broadly agreed that the decrease in illegal crossers --down to about 340,000 migrants apprehended in 2011 from a peak of 1.1 million in 2005 -- has lightened the workload for the police, but has also brought worrisome changes in the type of crimes they confront.\par \par \uc2 While they no longer see huge flows of illegal migrants heading for low-wage work in the United States, federal and local officials said they now faced smaller numbers of more determined and potentially more dangerous crossers, including migrants carrying illegal drugs.\par \par \uc2 Sharp differences, even tension, arose between federal officials, who pointed to statistics and charts showing plummeting illegal entries as the border was reinforced over the last five years, and some local officers, particularly sheriffs who patrol the sun-seared expanses of desert in counties along the international line.\par \par \uc2 ''We've got a lot of rural county, a lot of ranch families, and a lot of those people are living in fear every day,'' said Rodney W. Rothrock, chief deputy sheriff of Cochise County, which borders Mexico in southeastern Arizona.\par \par \uc2 In a bright hall next door to the law enforcement conclave, dozens of technology vendors were offering the latest military-style tools to make the border even more secure. Contractors large and small displayed radar devices that can see through walls, thermal imaging cameras mounted on mobile masts that retract in seconds and unmanned drone boats to scout rivers too perilous for human navigation.\par \par \uc2 The face-off between state and federal officials started with an opening speech on Tuesday by Arizona's governor, Jan Brewer, who said federal border enforcement was an ''overarching outrage.'' Ms. Brewer, a Republican, is leading Arizona's legal fight against the Obama administration over a state law that would give the police new powers to arrest anyone suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''No amount of distortion can hide the absolute truth,'' Ms. Brewer said. ''For years, Washington has stood idly by, letting our borders grow more porous and more dangerous.''\par \par \uc2 In a riposte, Jayson P. Ahern, a former top official at the Customs and Border Protection agency, described Ms. Brewer's criticism as ''a very individualized opinion.'' Channeling many officials who were less outspoken because they are still in federal office, Mr. Ahern said border security had undergone ''remarkable improvements.''\par \par \uc2 He cited the expansion of the Border Patrol to more than 21,000 agents, the highest number in its history, and an array of new technology that is in use, including remote video surveillance systems and seven unmanned drones.\par \par \uc2 Matthew C. Allen, the special agent in charge of investigations for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the state, said 51 migrant smugglers' drop houses were raided in Phoenix last year, down from a peak of 186 in 2008. About 800 illegal migrants were arrested in those raids in 2011, compared with about 3,200 migrants in 2008, Mr. Allen said.\par \par \uc2 The police chief of Mesa, just east of Phoenix, said the crime rate was the lowest since the 1960s. The chief, Frank Milstead, said that only about 2 percent of the 17,900 people arrested in Mesa last year were suspected of being illegal immigrants. ''The operational impact on our jails,'' he said, ''is minimal.''\par \par \uc2 Raymond Cobos, the sheriff of Luna County, 3,000 square miles of border scrublands and sierras next door in New Mexico, said his deputies now arrested an average of eight illegal immigrants a day, down from a daily average of about 300 three years ago.\par \par \uc2 Chief Deputy Rothrock also acknowledged a new reality. In 2010, he said, more than 300 illegal crossers detained by the Border Patrol were turned over to Cochise County because they were wanted for crimes in the United States. Last year, he said, the number of illegal crossers with open warrants was seven.\par \par \uc2 But Chief Deputy Rothrock warned that Cochise deputies were beginning to encounter ''a different type of illegal alien'': migrants alone or in small groups toting backpacks loaded with marijuana or methamphetamine. The migrants often plan to hand off the narcotics to a courier and return quickly to Mexico, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of times they take the opportunity to help themselves to the citizens' property,'' Chief Deputy Rothrock said, breaking into homes.\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey Scott Kirkham, the police chief in Nogales, the busiest legal port of entry in Arizona, said his city's crime rate was very low, with two homicides in the last seven years.\par \par \uc2 But in an arrest that shocked Chief Kirkham, a high school student was recently found with nearly four pounds of heroin, worth about $80,000, in his backpack.\par \par \uc2 Federal investigators also reported ''an alarming increase'' in attacks by migrants on border agents, according to James Turgal, the F.B.I.'s special agent in charge in Arizona. In 2011, the agency opened investigations of nearly 500 assaults on federal officers along the Arizona border, from rock-throwing to shootings. That was more than four times the 117 assaults in 2008, he said.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials said they were confident progress would continue, since handling fewer illegal migrants means they can devote more agents and surveillance equipment to drug trafficking.\par \par \uc2 But even optimists urged caution. ''The primary magnet that draws people across our border from Mexico is employment,'' said Mr. Allen of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ''I think we all recognize that the real test for us is going to come when the economy turns around in a very significant way.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: An attendee at the Border Security Expo last week in Phoenix.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 There is one area, besides copper mining and home foreclosures, where Arizona is a national leader. It's at the front of a movement by states and local governments to seize control of immigration from the federal government. In 2010 it passed a law, S.B. 1070, that made the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants its official policy with a grab bag of enforcement schemes that turned federal immigration infractions into state crimes. Among other things, the law required immigration checks by local police, required immigrants to carry papers with them, and made it illegal for the undocumented to live or look for work in the state, or for people to knowingly hire, harbor or transport them.\par \par \uc2 A state with its own immigration law -- that is, its own foreign policy -- raises obvious constitutional issues. The Supreme Court is taking up S.B. 1070 next month, addressing the question of whether federal authority pre-empts state and local immigration crackdowns. A decision is expected this summer. The court could help bottle up a dangerous trend, or unleash more mischief across the country.\par \par \uc2 Last year was a banner year for immigration laws in the states. Arizona's law set a low standard that other states have tried to match or outdo. Thirty-one states introduced legislation in 2011 imitating all or part of S.B. 1070, and five -- Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah -- went whole hog, passing Arizona-style omnibus laws.\par \par \uc2 Despite evidence that such laws are terrible for business and constitutionally unsound -- courts have blocked key parts of the laws in Arizona and the copycat states, while employers and residents have complained bitterly about their burdens and expense -- lawmakers have not been deterred. Missouri, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and West Virginia are considering similar crackdowns. (Mississippi's bill also includes a provision that shields ''international business executives'' from being hassled by the police, perhaps inspired by an incident in Alabama where a manager from Mercedes-Benz was arrested under the new immigration law.)\par \par \uc2 The restrictionist trend is hitting cities and local governments, too, hundreds of which have passed laws and ordinances touching on immigration, including requiring employers to certify workers' legal status, cracking down on rental housing, mandating English as an official language, and forbidding day laborers to seek work in public. Some of these have faced legal challenges -- notably the anti-solicitation laws, which have had a string of defeats in federal district and appellate courts.\par \par \uc2 The new legal crazy quilt isn't all hostile to immigrants. Some places are trying to be more welcoming while ensuring that immigration remains a federal responsibility. New York City and Cook County, Ill., are among the governments that have passed laws limiting the role of local police in immigration arrests, and California is considering such a law. While lawmakers in 37 states last year proposed bills requiring the use of a federal database, E-Verify, to check the immigration status of job applicants, most of those measures were rejected; only eight states adopted new E-Verify regulations last year. Arizona, Mississippi, South Carolina and Utah already had such laws; California and Illinois have laws forbidding governments to force employers to use E-Verify.\par \par \uc2 The zeal to crack down locally is based on several fallacies. One is that the federal government hasn't enforced immigration laws, even though it has greatly expanded border security in the last decade and the Obama administration is deporting immigrants at a record clip. Another is that illegal immigration is soaring, when it has ebbed in the last few years.\par \par \uc2 The final myth is that voters really want unrelenting harshness. In fact, polls show broad support for a comprehensive federal solution with tougher border and workplace enforcement, but also a path to legalization for the undocumented and a streamlined process for new legal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The reaction in places like Alabama, where civil rights advocates who re-enacted the Selma-to-Montgomery march last week demanded the repeal of the state's immigration law, shows that citizens are willing to fight back when their lawmakers go too far.\par \par \uc2 MAP: Arizona and the Immigration Copycats (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures; National Immigration Law Center); CHARTS: How Voters Would Solve the Problem: U.S. \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population.; Percent of poll respondents who said U.S. illegal immigrants should.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLLEGE STATION, Tex. -- Jose Luis Zelaya stood with a crowd of other students waiting to hear the news. It was election day at Texas A&M University here, and he was running for student body president. A victory for Mr. Zelaya, a 24-year-old graduate student from Honduras, would make history at Texas A&M: He would become its first Hispanic student body president -- and the first \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to hold the position.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zelaya came to the United States at age 14, fleeing an abusive father and gang violence and hoping to reunite with his mother and sister in Houston. Last year, at a campus rally organized by supporters of the proposed Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who go to college, he spoke of being undocumented, and described his journey from cleaning windshields at stoplights and sleeping under a bridge in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula to attending the sixth-largest university in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Long after midnight one night last month, as students gathered outside a student services building to hear the election results, Mr. Zelaya's campaign to lead a student body of 50,000 came to an abrupt end. He had lost: Out of 14,074 ballots cast, he had received 1,142 votes, coming in fourth out of six candidates.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Zelaya and the other roughly 300 Texas A&M students who are illegal immigrants, feeling both welcome and unwelcome are part of life at one of the most conservative colleges in the country. On the one hand, Mr. Zelaya and other undocumented students receive support and encouragement from university administrators, faculty members and fellow students. As Mr. Zelaya walked around campus recently, he greeted Hispanic and white friends, talked about an encouraging \uc2 Facebook\uc2  message he received from the university's president, R. Bowen Loftin, after the election and hugged Marisa Suhm, the assistant director of the Department of Multicultural Services. When Mr. Zelaya graduated in December with a bachelor's degree, he led the invocation at the ceremony.\par \par \uc2 Yet at the same time, undocumented students say they have been made to feel unwelcome. At last year's rally, a student who is a member of a campus conservative group approached Mr. Zelaya and bluntly told him that he had reported him to the federal immigration authorities. In 2010, the student senate passed a bill opposing the state law that allows illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities, though it was vetoed by the student body president.\par \par \uc2 And while Mr. Zelaya spent no money on signs or a Web site for his campaign -- one of his rival candidates spent $900 on T-shirts -- some students were reluctant to vote for him, either because of his immigration status or because they felt he would be more of a minority advocate than a student advocate.\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of people were worried that someone who isn't completely following the law might be representing our university,'' said Thomas McNutt, 21, who also ran for student body president. ''Whether you agree with the undocumented student issue or disagree with it, the law is the law as it is right now.''\par \par \uc2 Justin Pulliam, who graduated in December and was a co-founder of Texas Aggie Conservatives, the group whose member notified immigration officials last year and which endorsed Mr. McNutt for president, put it another way. ''Most Texas A&M students don't want a taxpayer-funded \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  activist to hijack the student body president's office in order to advance a pro-amnesty agenda,'' said Mr. Pulliam, 22, who pointed out that student candidates in the past had been criticized for minor run-ins with the law. ''These candidates have been attacked and discredited, but now people are celebrating when an out and proud \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  runs to lead the student body.''\par \par \uc2 While many undocumented students found Mr. Zelaya's campaign inspiring, his defeat was a reminder to some of the difficulties they face gaining widespread acceptance on a campus that last year came in third in the Princeton Review's rankings of colleges with the most conservative students. ''I think we could have won'' the election in any other university, said Greisa Martinez, 23, an undocumented student who co-founded a group with Mr. Zelaya called the Council for Minority Student Affairs. She said a Hispanic student told her of being in a class during which the professor, discussing the growth of Hispanics in Texas, said the state could have a Hispanic governor in the future. A number of students in the class hissed.\par \par \uc2 ''It was an audible insensitive thing,'' Ms. Martinez said. ''People aren't open to a Latino being in that kind of position. When it comes to issues like this, there's always that divide, and it's, 'Am I welcome or not?' ''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zelaya said inspiring others, not necessarily winning votes, had been his goal. ''It's not about being undocumented,'' said Mr. Zelaya, who wants to become a teacher and is seeking a master's degree in curriculum and instruction. ''It's about inspiring people to go to college, inspiring the parents to inspire their kids, to inspire that person who mows the lawn that they can do better.''\par \par \uc2 If his campaign had any success, then perhaps it was in the extent to which his immigration status had become a nonissue. During candidate debates, immigration came up only briefly, at the end of one of the events, when Mr. Zelaya was asked how his status would play a role if he was elected. Students said Mr. Zelaya lost votes for reasons that had nothing to do with his status, like his lack of name recognition. ''The issue that he is an openly undocumented citizen did not come up really at all in the election,'' said John Claybrook, 21, who ran against Mr. Zelaya and was named student body president-elect this week. ''Nobody used that as a weapon against him.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zelaya is struggling to pay all of his $3,500 tuition this semester. His main source of income comes from selling beanies that he crochets. He plans on pursuing a doctorate after receiving his master's, but expressed frustration that although he volunteers as a tutor at a middle school, he cannot teach there, because he cannot legally work in the United States. To do that, he says, he would have to return to Honduras and wait years or even decades for legal entry.\par \par \uc2 ''The only reason why I want to be legalized and I want to have documentation is that I can teach,'' he said. ''I don't want to do anything else in this life but teach. Because it's a teacher that inspired me to go to college. All I want to do is to be able to do the same thing.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Jose Luis Zelaya on the phone last week at Texas A&M.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Among all the numbers that populate Nataly Lopez's life -- including phone digits, addresses, pass codes and friends' ages -- there is one that she never forgets: the cost of a semester's tuition at Baruch College, where she is a sophomore.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lopez, 21, is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Ecuador and has struggled to make ends meet, working several jobs to be able to pay for school.\par \par \uc2 ''Two thousand eight hundred and five,'' she said. ''I know that number because I have to reach it to get to the next semester.''\par \par \uc2 State proposals that would make government financial aid available for illegal immigrants like Ms. Lopez are pending in Albany. Frustrated with the pace of federal and state legislative action, advocacy groups, with the support of New York City officials, have developed a stopgap solution -- for a small number of needy students, at least.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, the groups announced the recipients of a new college scholarship specifically for illegal immigrants, the first such program in the state, they said.\par \par \uc2 The program is financed by foundations and private donors, not public sources. But it has received crucial financing and support from the Fund for Public Advocacy, a nonprofit arm of the office of the city's public advocate, Bill de Blasio, a likely candidate for mayor in 2013.\par \par \uc2 ''We all have to make up for the madness of our national policies,'' Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference to introduce the 10 recipients, including Ms. Lopez. ''As an American and the grandson of immigrants, I'm offended we even have to be standing here having this discussion.''\par \par \uc2 The first round of scholarships, called Dream Fellowships, was open only to undergraduates in the City University of New York system. The program allocates $2,000 toward a semester's tuition per recipient. It also places the students in a leadership-development program and provides them with internships at immigrant-advocacy organizations across the city.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the California Legislature passed a bill allowing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students access to state financial aid. In the absence of similar legislation in other states, advocates have created private scholarships specifically intended for illegal immigrants, though they remain rare.\par \par \uc2 More than 100 students applied for the fellowships, which are coordinated by the New York Immigration Coalition and receive additional financing from the Korean American Community Foundation, as well as small contributions by several labor unions.\par \par \uc2 The initial group of fellows immigrated from East and South Asia and Central and South America. In the news conference, they said that the internships were an opportunity to broaden their education, and that the money was a much-needed windfall to help allay tuition.\par \par \uc2 They spoke of their ambitions to pursue advanced degrees and become highly trained professionals -- in the United States. But they also described the stresses of living in legal shadows, juggling jobs and classes while pressing forward toward an uncertain future.\par \par \uc2 Yohan Garcia, 25, said he dropped out of high school in Mexico and came to the United States nine years ago. While holding various low-wage jobs, including washing dishes, he learned English and enrolled at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. He now attends Hunter College and hopes to become a human rights lawyer or senator.\par \par \uc2 ''I am a dreamer,'' he declared.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lopez, who immigrated at age 4, said she dropped out of college in 2009 when she could no longer pay for her classes. As the gravity of her legal situation dawned on her -- ''the realization that I can't do anything in this country,'' Ms. Lopez said -- she pitched headlong into depression.\par \par \uc2 It took her a year to return to college. Now in the last semester of her sophomore year and pursuing a major in the psychology of language, she works full time as a waitress and is also a social media consultant for a Web design company and an English tutor.\par \par \uc2 ''Our stories represent 65,000 students who are in the same position,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Nataly Lopez, at lectern, and nine other City University of New York students received financial aid packages Thursday. Illegal immigrants do not have access to government aid under state law.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Polls of voters in Tuesday's presidential primary in Michigan highlight the deep tension underpinning the Republican nominating contest, with Mitt Romney holding steady as the most electable candidate while Rick Santorum waged a serious challenge with a strong conservative base.\par \par \uc2 A majority of voters in Michigan said Mr. Romney was the candidate most likely to defeat President Obama, while just a quarter chose Mr. Santorum, according to exit poll results. But electability was not as great a factor for Michigan voters as it had been for voters in Nevada and Florida, where Mr. Romney won handily, or in South Carolina, where voters preferred Newt Gingrich.\par \par \uc2 About a third of Michigan primary voters said electability was the top quality they were looking for in a candidate, and about 2 in 10 were looking for someone with the right experience -- both strong groups for Mr. Romney. But Mr. Santorum countered with solid support from voters looking for someone with a strong moral character (about one-fourth) and those seeking a true conservative (about one in six). Mr. Romney trailed among groups that had posed problems for him in some earlier contests, including very conservative voters and strong Tea Party supporters.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Romney ran strongly among groups that he has tended to attract, including older voters and higher-income residents. In Michigan, those who are 65 and older made up about a quarter of the electorate, an increase from 16 percent in 2008.\par \par \uc2 As has been the case in every contest with exit polls so far this year, the top issue was the economy. More than half of the voters in Michigan chose the economy as their most important issue, while about a quarter cited the federal budget deficit. Mr. Romney won nearly half of these voters.\par \par \uc2 Although far fewer voters placed abortion highest, about one in seven, Mr. Santorum drew about three-fourths of their votes.\par \par \uc2 Democrats and independents were allowed to participate in Michigan's Republican primary, yielding a somewhat different electorate than in previous contests. About 6 in 10 said they were Republican, the fewest so far except in New Hampshire. About 3 in 10 were independents, while almost 10 percent -- the most in any nominating contest to date -- said they were Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Some had encouraged Democrats to try to influence the primary outcome, including Mr. Santorum's campaign, which used automated calls to urge Democrats to cast a vote against Mr. Romney. Exit poll results did not show much effect; Democratic turnout differed little from four years ago, when it accounted for 7 percent of the state's Republican primary voters. And it was far lower than the 17 percent in 2000.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Santorum did succeed in pulling Democratic votes his way. Most Democratic voters voted for Mr. Santorum, far outpacing Democratic support for any other candidate.\par \par \uc2 While Republican voters preferred Mr. Romney, independents were closely divided between the top two candidates. About 6 in 10 Michigan voters described themselves as conservative, including about 3 in 10 who said they were very conservative -- up somewhat from 2008. Mr. Santorum won strong conservatives, who did not favor Mr. Romney in several other states, including Florida, Iowa and South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 About a quarter of Michigan voters said it mattered a great deal that a candidate shared their religious beliefs. They strongly favored Mr. Santorum, although Mr. Romney won considerable support from Catholic women.\par \par \uc2 In a state with one of the highest union membership rates in the country, almost one-fourth said they or someone in their household belonged to a labor union. These voters leaned toward Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania who tried to appeal to blue-collar workers.\par \par \uc2 Voters in Michigan were a bit more apt to say they disapproved of the government's bailout to United States automakers a few years ago. Opponents of the aid were closely divided between Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney.\par \par \uc2 Compared with Michigan, the Arizona electorate is more Republican, conservative and supportive of the Tea Party movement. Yet Mr. Santorum did less well among these groups than he did in Michigan. Mr. Romney won in Arizona among men and women and across all age groups, education levels and income groups.\par \par \uc2 About one in seven voters in Arizona were Mormon, helping to lift Mr. Romney there. More than 9 in 10 Mormon voters supported him.\par \par \uc2 About one in eight Arizona voters called illegal immigration their top issue, more than in any other contest where exit polls have asked about it. Still, many more cited the economy, making it voters' top issue in Arizona as well.\par \par \uc2 Arizona voters were divided over what to do with \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers. About a third said they should be deported, and as many said they should be offered a chance at citizenship. Nearly 3 in 10 said they should be allowed to stay as temporary workers.\par \par \uc2 The polls, conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of the television networks and The Associated Press, include interviews with voters as they were leaving polling places across Michigan and Arizona and telephone interviews with early and absentee voters in each state.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Gingrich; Paul; Romney; Santorum\par \par \uc2 CHARTS: How Different Groups Voted: Based on interviews with voters.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 One said goodbye, embracing his anxious parents. One left without a word, indignant and angry.\par \par \uc2 After traveling thousands of miles by bus, train and on foot, the two young men met in a homeless shelter on Chicago's Northwest Side.\par \par \uc2 Oscar was a shy 15-year-old when his parents hired a local ''coyote'' in July 2008 to help him leave Veracruz, Mexico, and cross the border to seek work in the United States. Jorge, gregarious, bright-eyed and also 15, gathered up his 6-year-old cousin six months later and left Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in the middle of the night, to escape abuse that he said had escalated into fistfights with his father. He also planned to work and send money back to his mother.\par \par \uc2 Without knowing it, both were headed toward homelessness. In that, they joined thousands of other immigrant children who have left their native country -- for work, family reunification or refuge -- crossed into the United States and wound up alone.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the Office of Refugee Resettlement reported that 8,244 children entered the United States unaccompanied and without immigration documents and eventually ended up in its custody. Illinois received 627 of them.\par \par \uc2 One of a dozen states with federal centers for unaccompanied immigrant youths taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security, Illinois is home to 4 of the nation's 53 facilities.\par \par \uc2 The state offers 147 beds to unaccompanied immigrant youths.\par \par \uc2 When young people turn 18, they are released from the facilities, some into adult detention centers, others to family members. In some cases, homeless shelters become their only refuge as they apply for asylum or special visas.\par \par \uc2 Today, Jorge and Oscar are both 18, with no family to house them and no criminal histories that would warrant a transfer to a detention facility.\par \par \uc2 They arrived in June at Solid Ground, a nonprofit youth homeless shelter in Humboldt Park, where they will most likely remain until a decision is made on their applications for immigration relief. The process can take years.\par \par \uc2 With the help of local advocates and lawyers working pro bono, Jorge is seeking asylum, citing family abuse and the pressure and influence of gang recruitment in Honduras. Oscar applied for a visa for victims of human trafficking, claiming eligibility because he was exploited as a migrant farm worker.\par \par \uc2 While they wait, Oscar and Jorge must stay close for court-ordered interviews and proceedings that they hope will allow them to remain in this country. Both asked to be identified only by their first names for fear of jeopardizing their cases.\par \par \uc2 The handful of people in Chicago who work with young homeless immigrants -- who come mainly from Central America, Mexico, Africa, India and China -- say such young people are often neglected.\par \par \uc2 ''It's been very challenging to find spaces for these kids,'' said Jennifer Nagda, the associate director of Chicago's Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights. ''There is not exactly a wealth of beds to begin with for the domestic population, let alone unaccompanied youth.''\par \par \uc2 Sol Flores, executive director of La Casa Norte, the nonprofit organization that operates Solid Ground, said she was surprised by the increasing number of undocumented youths at the shelter. ''We never thought we would have a young person who was brought to this country from Sudan and abandoned by his caretaker,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Advocates say young, homeless immigrants typically come to the United States to seek work, reconnect with family or flee persecution, abuse or violence.\par \par \uc2 Susan Trudeau, the executive director of child welfare programs at Heartland Human Care Services, operator of the four Illinois facilities for unaccompanied immigrant youths, said she had seen an increase in the number of young people fleeing Central American gangs.\par \par \uc2 ''They are being recruited; their families are being threatened,'' she said. ''They are being threatened. So it is just easier to run away.''\par \par \uc2 Fleeing such gangs one night in the winter of 2009, Jorge took along his 6-year-old cousin, Eric, who longed to reunite with his mother, who was working in the United States. The cousins began a monthlong, nearly 4,000-mile journey from Honduras -- first by bus, then by freight train and finally on foot.\par \par \uc2 When Jorge left, his backpack held a change of clothes for him and his cousin and enough money for bus fare and some food, he said. After taking the bus to Guatemala, they began the most treacherous part of the trek: illegally riding on the tops and sides of freight trains that snaked through Guatemala and into Mexico.\par \par \uc2 For five days they walked along the tracks, following them to the station where the train originated. When it finally came, he and hundreds of other would-be migrants sprang from the tall grass that hid them and clambered aboard. To keep Eric safe, Jorge carried his cousin on his back and placed his backpack over the boy, effectively strapping him in as they jumped on and off the moving trains, he said.\par \par \uc2 After two weeks, they arrived in Mexico and found a man willing to take them across the border into the United States.\par \par \uc2 They walked for seven days, barely sleeping and sharing food among the other migrants.\par \par \uc2 ''We would stop to rest,'' Jorge said. ''But not for too long because it was so cold out and we knew we had to keep moving to stay warm. When we did stop and sit for a while, no one slept. We just sat quietly near each other.''\par \par \uc2 When he arrived in the United States, Eric went to live with his mother nearby in Arizona. Jorge, with limited English, no visa and no family, said he began supporting himself by dealing drugs -- cocaine and heroin.\par \par \uc2 He was eventually arrested in Colorado, taken into federal custody and sent to the Illinois Children's Center, one of the four Illinois detention facilities for immigrant youths. Jorge remained at the low-security center for seven months. When he turned 18, he was required to wear a GPS monitoring anklet as a condition of his release to Solid Ground.\par \par \uc2 Oscar's sojourn began on the evening of July 28, 2008. After hugging his family goodbye, he left alongside his 16-year-old cousin, Victor.\par \par \uc2 The coyote his family enlisted to enable his journey cost them 18,000 pesos, roughly $1,700 at the time, money his father borrowed from a family friend, Oscar said.\par \par \uc2 ''Take care of yourself and call us when you get to the border,'' he recalled his mother saying apprehensively as he left, with a few hundred pesos in his pocket, to board a bus bound for Sonora, Mexico, a border state. From there, he walked for seven days and six nights through Mexico toward Arizona.\par \par \uc2 By the third day in the desert under the August sun, Oscar's backpack, once heavy with canned vegetables, water, Gatorade and fresh tortillas, was empty except for water. His iPod, filled with music by Intocable, a popular Norteno band, had no charge for its battery. He walked three more days with no food before crossing, penniless, into Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Oscar soon found migrant farm work, traveling with two friends to wherever the crops were: watermelons in Delaware and Georgia, apples in Pennsylvania, oranges in Florida.\par \par \uc2 But the conditions were exploitative, he said. According to an affidavit filed with his relief application, Oscar was not paid regularly and not allowed to leave the work camps. His employers said immigration authorities would find him if he fled. Oscar was not fed adequately and was forced to sleep on the floor without blankets, his social worker said.\par \par \uc2 ''When I came here, my only objective was to work,'' Oscar said. ''I wasn't thinking about finishing school or learning English. I came to work.''\par \par \uc2 In May 2010, after an altercation with an employer over unpaid wages, Oscar said, he was arrested and taken into federal custody in Georgia. After detention at a youth facility in Miami, he was released that fall to an uncle in Champaign, Ill. But soon after Oscar arrived, his uncle returned to Mexico because he feared that Oscar's presence might draw attention to his illegal status, Oscar said.\par \par \uc2 Last May the Office of Refugee Resettlement confirmed Oscar's eligibility as a victim of labor trafficking. This status should help Oscar obtain his visa, his lawyer said. According to the department's annual report, 91 youths received such letters in 2010, up from 50 the previous year.\par \par \uc2 Since arriving at La Casa Norte, Oscar and Jorge fill their days with G.E.D. and English classes.\par \par \uc2 Over the winter Oscar received a work visa and is employed part time at a Mexican restaurant on Chicago's Northwest Side.\par \par \uc2 Jorge, still awaiting work papers, spends his time drawing, painting murals and playing soccer. But if the ball hits his ankle, it sets off the monitoring device, forcing him report to immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 Despite his arrest, detention and homelessness, Jorge said he would make the journey to the United States again. The country has fewer gangs and less violence than his homeland.\par \par \uc2 Oscar, though, said he regretted coming to the United States He is thankful for the opportunities, but if he knew then what he knows now, he said, he would still call Mexico home.\par \par \uc2 They phone home every few weeks. Yet neither Oscar nor Jorge has seen his family since walking away.\par \par \uc2 Cast Away: The last of a series of articles on the rising number of homeless youths and families in Chicago, often living beyond the reach of helping hands.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Oscar, right, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  living in Chicago, in his room at La Casa Norte Solid Ground housing in Humboldt Park.; Jorge, left, taking an online test. He came to the United States when he was 15 and helped create the mural in the computer room at La Casa Norte Solid Ground, a nonprofit shelter for youths.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 One student spent her childhood in four homeless shelters, bouncing around 12 schools, and now works 20 hours a week at a supermarket so she can pay for her imprisoned father to call her regularly, collect. Another did not see his father for practically the first 12 years of his life -- except for webcam conversations -- because he was in China while his father was toiling as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in a New York restaurant. A third saw her parents divorce and move away, leaving her to move in with her stepgrandmother.\par \par \uc2 Those three students and five other high school seniors are the winners of this year's New York Times College Scholarships. They became academic luminaries at their New York City high schools and are waiting to hear whether they have been admitted to some of the nation's most competitive colleges.\par \par \uc2 These students did not succumb to the setbacks that came their way. Certainly, they wobbled and sometimes buckled, but they picked themselves up and chose to make their lives as full-throated as they could, capitalizing on their talents.\par \par \uc2 ''I made a conscious decision not to use adversity as an excuse, but as a motivator,'' said Shirley LaVarco, 17, a senior at John Dewey High School in Brooklyn. Her father is incarcerated at Mohawk Correctional Facility in Rome, N.Y., for what she described as white-collar crimes.\par \par \uc2 Since 1996, scholarships from The Times have helped 226 high school graduates pay for four years of college at institutions like Columbia (38 students), Harvard (19), Cornell (14), New York University (12) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (11). The students are also provided with summer jobs at The Times and, in more than a few cases, with de facto parenting. The eight new winners were winnowed from a pool of 516 applicants.\par \par \uc2 ''The program looks for students who are academic achievers but can also be classified as survivors,'' said Desiree L. Dancy, the vice president for corporate human resources at The Times. ''The resiliency they demonstrate at this early stage of their life will certainly prepare them for other life experiences,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Survivors they are, though the hurt they have suffered still reveals itself in a quiver of the voice, a forced smile or willed poise.\par \par \uc2 As a seventh grader, Yvonne Cha, now 17, the daughter of Korean immigrants, had to move in, along with her younger brother, with a stepgrandmother after her parents divorced. Her mother moved to China for what she saw as a business opportunity, Ms. Cha said, while her father ''moved to the other side of Queens without so much as a goodbye.'' There were times, living with her stepgrandmother, that Ms. Cha had to plead with the landlord to let the family remain.\par \par \uc2 On a teacher's advice she applied for a full scholarship to Horace Mann School, one of the city's most competitive private schools, where she became an A-minus student. After all, she said, her mother had always told her, ''Even if you're a small fish you should swim in a big sea.''\par \par \uc2 ''The fact that I've had to overcome so many things makes what you've achieved so much more worth it,'' Ms. Cha said.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the application essay written for The Times by Bianca Duah, 17, a student at Michael J. Petrides High School in Staten Island, best captures the situation all eight students have faced.\par \par \uc2 ''At times I identify myself with the Virgin Mary, as she and I were innocently thrust into parenthood at a time when we were supposed to be basking in our purity and naivete,'' she wrote. ''I'm the mother of my mommy and my brother.''\par \par \uc2 Her mother, a Ghanaian immigrant who once worked as a home health aide, is often bedridden because of rheumatoid arthritis, despite operations on her knees. Her 10-year-old brother was severely burned by hot oil; he had eight operations and still has to have his head wounds regularly cleaned and medicated.\par \par \uc2 Bianca is a nurse to both of them, yet she is so focused on her own quest for a meaningful life that she has earned a 97 average and become a star sprinter on the track team, running the 400 meters in 64 seconds.\par \par \uc2 Khalil Drayton's father disappeared long ago, and his mother, an immigrant from Trinidad and Tobago, works the 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. shift as a cashier at a \uc2 Walgreen's\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So Khalil, 17, her eldest son and a brawny six-footer, monitors homework and orchestrates bedtime for his six siblings, not an easy task in a studio apartment in Queens with two sets of bunk beds and a futon.\par \par \uc2 Being the surrogate father takes up so much time that he had to give up shot-putting and throwing the discus at Francis Lewis High School. But he has a 95 average and is focused on turning himself into an engineer.\par \par \uc2 ''My mom was hysterically crying last week when she heard I got the scholarship,'' he said. ''She is my inspiration. She works very hard and still manages to take care of us.''\par \par \uc2 Queen Adesuyi, 17, the daughter of a cabdriver and security guard, is the first member of her Nigerian immigrant family to apply for college. She has a 93 average at Aquinas High School in the Bronx and is laser-focused on a career as a criminal lawyer, hoping to make a first stop at the sex crimes unit of a prosecutor's office. She has been interning at the Bronx district attorney's office.\par \par \uc2 ''I am unstoppable -- just call me a juggernaut,'' she once wrote in a poem.\par \par \uc2 Five years ago, Hang Jing Qiu, now 17, came to New York from Fujian Province in southeast China, finally meeting the father he had not seen since infancy. He mastered English by forcing himself to read English newspapers and memorize vocabulary lists. He has taken four courses at Hunter College. He has even worked in a Chinese restaurant so he could appreciate his father's hard life and become determined not to end up in a job with low wages and long hours.\par \par \uc2 Solomon Ajasin, 17, recounted how his father was killed four years ago in a car wreck in Nigeria, and he had to become, as he put it, ''the man in the family.'' The death ''made me realize that life is fragile and you have no control over it,'' he said. Today he has a 93.5 average at Bronx Health Sciences High School; he hopes that will help put him on the path to becoming a doctor.\par \par \uc2 ''In Nigeria, we have an expression 'When someone dies, someone else is born,' '' he said. ''In my case my birth was not physical, but I was reborn.''\par \par \uc2 Farhana Nabi, 18, who came to the United States 12 years ago from Bangladesh, told of being teased and bullied by classmates for a small mole above her lip. But her mother, a coffee-shop cashier, told her, ''People can take everything from you'' but not your education.\par \par \uc2 Farhana bore down in school, achieving a 98 average at Brooklyn Technical High School, and finding that classmates considered her beautiful and exotic. She wants to become a neurologist.\par \par \uc2 ''I look in the mirror and I see someone whose hardships created a person of character with a dream and a focus,'' she wrote in her essay. ''I see someone who is confident not because others praise her but because she is proud of her life's work.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Scholarships were awarded to, clockwise from bottom left, Hang Jing Qiu, Shirley LaVarco, Bianca Duah, Solomon Ajasin, Yvonne Cha, Farhana Nabi, Queen Adesuyi and Khalil Drayton.

He married a Vietnamese woman he had only just met. And then a year ago, he decided in an instant to donate his left kidney to a stranger.\par \par \uc2 In February 2011, the desk clerk at Mr. Ruzzamenti's yoga studio told him she had recently donated a kidney to an ailing friend she had bumped into at Target. Mr. Ruzzamenti, 44, had never even donated blood, but the story so captivated him that two days later he called Riverside Community Hospital to ask how he might do the same thing.\par \par \uc2 Halfway across the country, in Joliet, Ill., Donald C. Terry Jr. needed a kidney in the worst way. Since receiving a diagnosis of diabetes-related renal disease in his mid-40s, he had endured the burning and bloating and dismal tedium of dialysis for nearly a year. With nobody in his family willing or able to give him a kidney, his doctors warned that it might take five years to crawl up the waiting list for an organ from a deceased donor.\par \par \uc2 ''It was like being sentenced to prison,'' Mr. Terry recalled, ''like I had done something wrong in my life and this was the outcome.''\par \par \uc2 As a dawn chill broke over Chicago on Dec. 20, Mr. Terry received a plump pink kidney in a transplant at Loyola University Medical Center. He did not get it from Mr. Ruzzamenti, at least not directly, but the two men will forever share a connection: they were the first and last patients in the longest chain of kidney transplants ever constructed, linking 30 people who were willing to give up an organ with 30 who might have died without one.\par \par \uc2 What made the domino chain of 60 operations possible was the willingness of a Good Samaritan, Mr. Ruzzamenti, to give the initial kidney, expecting nothing in return. Its momentum was then fueled by a mix of selflessness and self-interest among donors who gave a kidney to a stranger after learning they could not donate to a loved one because of incompatible blood types or antibodies. Their loved ones, in turn, were offered compatible kidneys as part of the exchange.\par \par \uc2 Chain 124, as it was labeled by the nonprofit National Kidney Registry, required lockstep coordination over four months among 17 hospitals in 11 states. It was born of innovations in computer matching, surgical technique and organ shipping, as well as the determination of a Long Island businessman named Garet Hil, who was inspired by his own daughter's illness to supercharge the notion of ''paying it forward.''\par \par \uc2 Dr. Robert A. Montgomery, a pioneering transplant surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, which was not involved in the chain, called it a ''momentous feat'' that demonstrated the potential for kidney exchanges to transform the field. ''We are realizing the dream of extending the miracle of transplantation to thousands of additional patients each year,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The chain began with an algorithm and an altruist. Over the months it fractured time and again, suspending the fates of those down the line until Mr. Hil could repair the breach. Eventually, he succeeded in finding needle-in-a-haystack matches for patients whose antibodies would have caused them to reject organs from most donors.\par \par \uc2 Until now, few of the donors and recipients have known one another's names. But 59 of the 60 participants consented to be identified by The New York Times and to tell the stories, each with distinct shadings, that ultimately connected them.\par \par \uc2 Despite an intensely bitter breakup, a Michigan man agreed to donate a kidney for his former girlfriend for the sake of their 2-year-old daughter. A woman from Toronto donated for her fifth cousin from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, after meeting him by chance in Italy and then staying in touch mostly by text messages.\par \par \uc2 Children donated for parents, husbands for wives, sisters for brothers. A 26-year-old student from Texas gave a kidney for a 44-year-old uncle in California whom he rarely saw. In San Francisco, a 62-year-old survivor of Stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma donated for her son-in-law.\par \par \uc2 On Aug. 15, Mr. Ruzzamenti's kidney flew east on a Continental red-eye from Los Angeles to Newark and was rushed to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. There it was stitched into the abdomen of a 66-year-old man.\par \par \uc2 The man's niece, a 34-year-old nurse, had wanted to give him her kidney, but her Type A blood clashed with his Type O. So in exchange for Mr. Ruzzamenti's gift, she agreed to have her kidney shipped to the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison for Brooke R. Kitzman's transplant. It was Ms. Kitzman's former boyfriend, David Madosh, who agreed to donate a kidney on her behalf despite their acrimonious split.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Madosh's kidney flew to Pittsburgh for Janna Daniels, a clerical supervisor, who got her transplant at \uc2 Allegheny General Hospital\uc2 . And her husband, Shaun, a mechanic, sent his kidney to Mustafa Parks, a young father of two at Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego.\par \par \uc2 On and on the chain extended, with kidneys flying from coast to coast, iced down in cardboard boxes equipped with GPS devices and stowed on commercial aircraft.\par \par \uc2 In a system built on trust, one leap of faith followed another. The burdens of scheduling operations all across the country -- so donors would not have to travel -- meant that operations were not always simultaneous, or even sequential. The most worrisome risk was that donors would renege once their loved ones received kidneys.\par \par \uc2 After John A. Clark of Sarasota, Fla., got a transplant on Sept. 28 at Tampa General Hospital, his wife, Rebecca, faced a 68-day wait before it was her turn to keep the chain going. Ms. Clark said that it crossed her mind to back out, but that she swatted away the temptation.\par \par \uc2 ''I believe in karma,'' Ms. Clark said, ''and that would have been some really bad karma. There was somebody out there who needed my kidney.''\par \par \uc2 An Organ to Spare\par \par \uc2 It is considered a quirk of evolution that humans have two kidneys when they need only one to filter waste and remove excess fluid from the body. Yet when kidneys fail, whether from diabetes or high blood pressure or genetic disorders, they tend to fail in tandem.\par \par \uc2 Death can arrive in a matter of weeks for many renal patients if they do not have their blood cleansed through dialysis. The process takes almost four hours, three times a week, and leaves many too drained to work. Only half of dialysis patients survive more than three years.\par \par \uc2 Many of the 400,000 Americans who are tethered to dialysis dream of a transplant as their pathway back to normal. But with the demand for kidneys rising faster than the number of donors, the waits have grown longer. While about 90,000 people are lined up for kidneys, fewer than 17,000 receive one each year, and about 4,500 die waiting, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which maintains the wait list for the government.\par \par \uc2 Only a third of transplanted kidneys come from living donors, but they are coveted because they typically last longer than cadaver kidneys. For kidneys transplanted in 1999, 60 percent of organs from live donors were still functioning after 10 years, compared with 43 percent of organs from deceased donors.\par \par \uc2 Although other living tissue can be transplanted -- slices of pancreas, liver and intestine, bone marrow and lobes of lung -- kidneys are uniquely suited because donors have a spare and the operations are almost always successful.\par \par \uc2 A reason there are not more live kidney donations, however, is that about a third of transplant candidates with a willing donor find that they are immunologically incompatible. Some, because of previous transplants, blood transfusions or pregnancies, may have developed antibodies that make them highly likely to reject a new kidney.\par \par \uc2 Using a blood-filtering technique known as plasmapheresis, doctors can now lower the odds that a recipient will reject an incompatible kidney. But the procedures are taxing and expensive.\par \par \uc2 Domino chains, which were first attempted in 2005 at Johns Hopkins, seek to increase the number of people who can be helped by living donors. In 2010, chains and other forms of paired exchanges resulted in 429 transplants. Computer models suggest that an additional 2,000 to 4,000 transplants could be achieved each year if Americans knew more about such programs and if there were a nationwide pool of all eligible donors and recipients.\par \par \uc2 Such transplants ultimately save money as well as lives. The federal Medicare program, which pays most treatment costs for chronic kidney disease, saves an estimated $500,000 to $1 million each time a patient is removed from dialysis through a live donor transplant (the operations typically cost $100,000 to $200,000). Coverage for kidney disease costs the government more than $30 billion a year, about 6 percent of the Medicare budget.\par \par \uc2 Dialysis, which in the United States is almost always administered in outpatient clinics, saps the productivity of caregivers as well as of patients. Nearly two years ago, Kent Bowen, 47, of Austin, Tex., gave up his job hanging gutters, and much of his freedom, so he could provide dialysis at home to his mother, Mary Jane Wilson.\par \par \uc2 Before donating a kidney for her as part of the chain on Dec. 7 at Methodist Hospital in Houston, Mr. Bowen said he looked forward not only to helping his mother, but also to a long-deferred fishing trip.\par \par \uc2 ''In all actuality,'' he said, ''giving a kidney is a small price to pay for getting my life back.''\par \par \uc2 Understanding the Pain\par \par \uc2 Garet Hil and his wife, Jan, may never fully recover from the snowy night in February 2007 when they took their 10-year-old daughter in with flu symptoms and emerged with a shocking diagnosis of nephrophthisis, a genetic kidney-wasting disease. They could not imagine sacrificing her youth to dialysis.\par \par \uc2 Because Mr. Hil and his daughter shared the same blood type, he assumed he would be able to give her one of his kidneys. But two days before surgery, doctors canceled the operations after discovering that his daughter had developed antibodies that would most likely cause rejection.\par \par \uc2 Jan Hil and six other family members volunteered but were also ruled out. Mr. Hil and his daughter joined several of the registries that had started to arrange kidney exchanges, but the pools were small and they never found a match. Fortunately, one of Mr. Hil's nephews then was tested and was able to donate.\par \par \uc2 After the successful transplant, Mr. Hil, a veteran business executive, could not shake his frustration that a more effective registry for paired kidney donation did not exist. ''The exchange systems out there weren't industrial strength,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 By the end of 2007, the Hils had formed the National Kidney Registry and rented office space in an old clapboard house in Babylon, N.Y. The couple invested about $300,000 to start it, and Mr. Hil, who is now 49, ran the registry without a salary.\par \par \uc2 ''The goal was very simple: get everybody transplanted in under six months if you had a living donor,'' he said. ''One of the things that drove us was the enormity of the problem. The other thing that drove us was that we understood the pain of being in that situation.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hil turned out to be the right person to infuse the budding science of kidney exchange with an entrepreneurial spark. A former Marine reconnaissance ranger with an M.B.A. from the Wharton School, he had managed a series of data and logistics companies in Boston and New York and understood the worlds of both computing and finance.\par \par \uc2 He had made his money and could step off the career track to give the registry his time and the resources of his software-consulting firm. He had a background in quantitative math and enough drive to plow through medical texts about organ compatibility. Over time, he led a team in designing sophisticated software that evolved to build ever-longer chains.\par \par \uc2 Disney\uc2 -hero handsome, with a cleft chin and thick wavy hair, Mr. Hil marketed his registry to hospitals with PowerPoints and passion. The transplant world initially regarded him as an interloper. But he has now persuaded 58 of the country's 236 kidney transplant centers, including many of the largest, to feed his database with information about pairs of transplant candidates and their incompatible donors.\par \par \uc2 Starting at 5 a.m. each workday, Mr. Hil manipulates several hundred pairs into transplant chains with a few clicks of a mouse. Last year, he arranged 175 transplants this way, including the 30 in Chain 124, more than any other registry. On average, patients received transplants about a year after being listed.\par \par \uc2 The same year that Mr. Hil's daughter got sick, Congress amended the National Organ Transplant Act to clarify that paired exchanges do not violate federal laws against selling organs. The blessing from Washington broke down resistance in many hospitals just as the National Kidney Registry was opening for business.\par \par \uc2 The Evolving Chain\par \par \uc2 Although the first live kidney was transplanted in 1954 in Boston, three decades passed before a Stony Brook University surgeon named Felix T. Rapaport first theorized about kidney swaps in a 1986 journal article. Korean surgeons completed the first exchanges in 1991, but they were not successfully attempted in the United States for nearly another decade.\par \par \uc2 Simple swaps among two pairs, with the operations performed at the same hospital on the same day, quickly evolved into complex exchanges among three pairs and then four and then six.\par \par \uc2 Then in 2007, a transplant surgeon at the University of Toledo Medical Center, Dr. Michael A. Rees, had a forehead-slapping insight. If an exchange began with a Good Samaritan who donated to a stranger, and if the operations did not have to be simultaneous, a chain could theoretically keep growing, limited only by the pool of available donors and recipients. Dr. Rees reported in 2009 that he had strung together a chain of 10 transplants.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hil seized on the idea and set out to build an algorithm that would enable even more transplants. Nowadays, his pool typically consists of 200 to 350 donor-recipient pairs. That is enough to generate roughly a googol -- 10 to the 100th power -- of possible chains of up to 20 transplants if all of the pairs are compatible, said Rich Marta, the registry's senior software designer.\par \par \uc2 The program quickly eliminates matches that will not work because of incompatible blood types or antibodies, or because a transplant candidate insists that a donor be under a certain age or a close immunological match. It then assembles up to a million viable combinations at a rate of 8,000 per second.\par \par \uc2 The algorithm ranks the possible combinations by the number of transplants they would enable, with weight given to chains that find kidneys for hard-to-match patients and those who have waited a long time.\par \par \uc2 There are several registries like Mr. Hil's, each with a distinct approach. Largely unregulated by government, they invite sensitive questions about oversight and ethics, including how kidneys are allocated. A number of medical societies are convening in March to seek consensus on that and other issues related to paired exchanges.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hil knows the patients in his pool only by code names and leaves all personal interactions to the hospitals. He keeps several chains running at a time, and says tending to them is like playing three-dimensional chess.\par \par \uc2 Chain 124 even included one pair that was immunologically compatible. Josephine Bonventre, a 40-year-old real estate agent from Toronto with Type O blood, could have donated a kidney directly to her fifth cousin, Cesare Bonventre, a 27-year-old tile worker from Brooklyn with Type B.\par \par \uc2 But a second level of matching requires the synching of six antigens, a series of proteins that determine compatibility. By joining the chain and donating down the line, on Dec. 6 at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Josephine enabled Cesare to get a stronger match -- three antigens instead of one. Her donation as a valued Type O then set off the final 11 transplants.\par \par \uc2 The registry did not charge transplant centers for its services until 2010, when Mr. Hil imposed fees to help cover costs. Hospitals now pay membership dues and a charge of $3,000 per transplant that is reimbursed by many private insurers but not by Medicare. The transplant recipients must be insured.\par \par \uc2 Each year, the registry's chains have grown longer, with Chain 124 topping the previous record by seven transplants. ''We've just scratched the surface,'' said Mr. Hil, who wears gold kidney-shaped cufflinks.\par \par \uc2 Long transplant chains save more lives than short chains. But they come with trade-offs because the longer they grow, the higher the risk that a donor will renege or that a link will break for other reasons.\par \par \uc2 The record-breaking chain survived its share of logistical setbacks. On Aug. 29, after the first five transplants, Mr. Hil lost a link because a donor could not take the necessary two to four weeks away from work. Later that day, he lost another when a transplant coordinator informed him that a potential recipient was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and therefore could not be covered by Medicare.\par \par \uc2 In late October, an entire segment fell apart when a donor at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco backed out for unexplained ''personal reasons.'' It was as if one domino had fallen short of the next, leaving those still standing frozen in place.\par \par \uc2 ''This makes us all sick,'' Dr. Steven Katznelson e-mailed Mr. Hil. ''We did not see this coming.''\par \par \uc2 ''Wow,'' Mr. Hil wrote back. The donor ''just put 23 patients at risk.''\par \par \uc2 The dependency of each link on the others kept patients on edge. ''Things can happen,'' Candice Ryan fretted a few days before her Dec. 5 transplant at Massachusetts General Hospital. ''You just pray that everything goes well. I can't relax until I'm asleep and on the table.''\par \par \uc2 Depending on the makeup of his registry at any moment, Mr. Hil likes to stretch his chains as long as reasonable and then end them if a donor is difficult to match or if one chain is draining others of potential transplants.\par \par \uc2 He does so by arranging for the final kidney to go to a fortunate transplant candidate like Mr. Terry who does not have a willing donor.\par \par \uc2 The Initial Link\par \par \uc2 Until recently, hospitals regularly turned away Good Samaritan donors on the working assumption that they were unstable. That has changed somewhat with experience. But when Rick Ruzzamenti showed up at Riverside Community Hospital asking to give a kidney to anyone in need, he still underwent rounds of psychological screening as well as medical tests.\par \par \uc2 The doctors and social workers did not know what to make of Mr. Ruzzamenti at first. He had a flat affect and an arid wit, and did not open up right away. As the hospital's transplant coordinator, Shannon White, pressed him about his motivations and expectations, he explained that his decision seemed rather obvious.\par \par \uc2 ''People think it's so odd that I'm donating a kidney,'' Mr. Ruzzamenti told her. ''I think it's so odd that they think it's so odd.''\par \par \uc2 The hospital wanted to make sure that he was not expecting glory, or even gratitude. Mr. Ruzzamenti stressed that no one should mistake him for a saint.\par \par \uc2 He had, after all, been a heavy drinker in his youth and had caroused his way through the Navy. He could be an unsmiling presence at work, where he helped manage a family electrical contracting business. He admitted that he did not visit his parents or grandmother enough.\par \par \uc2 Despite his occasional surliness, Mr. Ruzzamenti said he felt driven to help others when possible. And as he considered the relative risks and benefits of organ donation, particularly to relieve a whole chain of suffering, it just made so much sense. ''It causes a shift in the world,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps, he said, there was some influence from a Tibetan meditation he had practiced when he was first drawn to Buddhism six years ago. It is known as Tonglen. ''You think of the pain someone's in, and imagine you take it from them and give them back good,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ruzzamenti said he was in a position to donate only because the economy had dried up so much of his work. He was essentially unemployed and could take time off to recuperate. The 30 kidney recipients, he observed dryly, could ''all thank the recession.''\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Ruzzamenti told his wife, My Nhanh, about his plans, she made it abundantly clear, despite her rudimentary English, that she would leave him and return to Vietnam if he followed through. She had immigrated only eight months before, after a marriage largely arranged by the Buddhist temple where Mr. Ruzzamenti volunteered as a groundskeeper. If he died on the table, she demanded, how would she get by in a country where she felt so out of place?\par \par \uc2 ''I wanted to scare him,'' Ms. Ruzzamenti, who is known as Lucy, said as she combed her husband's close-cropped hair with her fingers. ''And to tell him that it scares me.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ruzzamenti was impressed by his petite wife's ferocity -- ''She's a bully,'' he said -- but he disregarded her threat. He knew research showed that the risk of death from kidney retrieval surgery was 3 in 10,000 and that people with one kidney live as long as those with two. To him, there was little doubt that any good he created would far outweigh any temporary discomfort to him or his wife.\par \par \uc2 As it happened, Mr. Ruzzamenti experienced an unusual level of pain during his recuperation at Riverside. It sometimes left him balled up in agony, and the Demerol only made him hallucinate. He did not really want company. But when the pain stirred him awake at night, he could see Lucy sleeping in the hospital bed beside his.\par \par \uc2 Acts of Devotion\par \par \uc2 There were other love stories along the way.\par \par \uc2 Gregory Person and Zenovia Duke, both now 38, had been junior high prom dates in 1987 in Astoria, Queens. They lost touch and then reconnected on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  after each had divorced. They saw each other occasionally, but he lived in Queens and she near Albany, so the relationship never got serious.\par \par \uc2 Not long after they reconnected, Mr. Person's half-sister died of kidney failure and he pledged to help someone else beat the disease if ever given the chance. Then Ms. Duke learned she needed a transplant.\par \par \uc2 On Aug. 31, Ms. Duke received a kidney from a woman in California and Mr. Person sent his to Ohio. As they recuperated at NewYork-Presbyterian , Mr. Person found himself regularly hobbling down to her room. Once they were both back on their feet, they started dating more regularly.\par \par \uc2 ''I've never had any person in my life actually do what they say they're going to do,'' Ms. Duke said, ''especially men. It spoke volumes that he was a man of his word.''\par \par \uc2 It was a different kind of devotion that led David Madosh, 47, to donate a kidney for Brooke Kitzman, 30. Their four-year relationship, which had produced a 2-year-old daughter, soured just as he was getting tested as a potential donor. The breakup, caused partly by the strains of her illness, was ugly enough that when Ms. Kitzman later matched to become part of the chain, she put the odds at no better than 50-50 that Mr. Madosh would still donate.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Madosh, who lost his mother when he was 5, did not want his daughter, Elsie, to lose hers.\par \par \uc2 The youngest of 12 children, he said he had been passed from one foster home to the next, eight in all, some that he described as little more than labor camps. ''I don't want my daughter to have to experience that,'' said Mr. Madosh, a tree cutter by trade. ''No matter what it takes, a daughter needs her mother.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Kitzman said she was grateful for Mr. Madosh's kidney, and had told him so when they visited in a hospital corridor. But both made it clear that his act of charity had barely eased the tension between them.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Madosh said he took satisfaction enough from seeing Elsie at play with her re-energized mother. ''When her mama comes to get her, and she gives her hugs and kisses, that's it right there,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 A Wish Come True\par \par \uc2 On Dec. 19, Chain 124 hurtled toward its conclusion with a final flurry of procedures at Ronald Reagan U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. Between dawn and dusk, three kidneys were removed and three were transplanted in neighboring operating rooms. One flew in from San Francisco. The last took off for O'Hare.\par \par \uc2 At the end of the cluster were Keith Zimmerman, 53, a bearish, good-humored man with a billy-goat's beard, and his older sister, Sherry Gluchowski, 59. She had recently moved from California to Texas but returned to donate her kidney.\par \par \uc2 The siblings had always been close, although family members marveled at their ability to bicker for 15 minutes over the proper way to construct a peanut butter sandwich. Their mother, Elsa Rickards, remembered teaching them as children ''that they might not have their mommy and daddy all the time, but they will always have each other.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zimmerman, who runs a repossession firm with his wife in Santa Clarita, had been given a diagnosis of kidney disease 25 years ago. With the help of a nutritionist, he had managed to avoid dialysis until the very last day before his transplant, when his doctor said the procedure was needed to clear his body of excess fluid.\par \par \uc2 In his hospital room before surgery, with seven family members shoehorned into every nook, Mr. Zimmerman calmed his nerves by listening to Aaron Neville on his iPod. He said he considered himself ''the lottery winner'' in the chain because his kidney would be coming from a healthy 28-year-old, Conor Bidelspach of Bend, Ore.\par \par \uc2 The surgery to remove a kidney, known as a nephrectomy, is remarkably bloodless these days. With Mr. Bidelspach on the table, Dr. Peter G. Schulam cut four dime-sized incisions on the left side of the abdomen. Through tubes inserted in the openings, the surgeon and his team maneuvered their cauterizing scalpels and a laparoscopic camera, which relayed images of Mr. Bidelspach's insides to monitors overhead.\par \par \uc2 The scalpel's super-heated pincers clamped down like crab claws, searing the kidney from surrounding tissue. There was no need to cut any muscle.\par \par \uc2 Once the kidney was free of connective tissue, Dr. Schulam clamped and snipped the renal artery and vein and ureter. He captured the kidney in a plastic bag, cinched it shut, and withdrew it quickly through a finger-length incision along the pelvic line.\par \par \uc2 The doctor poured the kidney into a bowl of ice and drained it of remaining blood. The slush in the blue bowl turned fruit-punch pink.\par \par \uc2 As others stitched up Mr. Bidelspach, Dr. Schulam wheeled the kidney on a cart into an adjoining operating room, where Mr. Zimmerman was already anesthetized. After stretching a hole in Mr. Zimmerman's midsection with a metal retractor, Dr. Jeffrey L. Veale lowered the kidney into place and sewed in the renal artery and vein. As soon as he unclamped them, the kidney pinked up with blood flow. Before attaching the ureter to the bladder, he gently massaged the tip of the narrow tube between two fingers and watched it spurt a few drops of urine.\par \par \uc2 ''No more dialysis for Mr. Zimmerman,'' Dr. Veale declared. ''This total stranger's kidney is making him pee.'' He left Mr. Zimmerman's own kidneys to shrivel harmlessly in place (removing them would add to surgical risk).\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Dr. Schulam was in yet another operating room removing Ms. Gluchowski's kidney. He placed it in a plastic bag filled with a preservative solution and knotted it shut, like a goldfish brought home from the pet store. It was packed in a plastic tub, topped with ice, and loaded into a cardboard box marked ''Left Kidney -- Donated Human Organ/Tissue for Transplant -- Keep Upright.''\par \par \uc2 A courier in one of Quick International's big red vans drove Sherry Gluchowski's kidney through stop-and-go traffic on Interstate 405 to the Los Angeles airport. Cynthia Goff, an operations supervisor for the courier company who had volunteered to accompany the kidney to Chicago, rolled the box into the terminal strapped atop her carry-on with a bungee cord. A pit bull, waiting to be placed in its travel kennel, strolled by and sniffed.\par \par \uc2 After security agents checked the box with a desktop scanner, Ms. Goff rolled the kidney down the concourse, past a currency exchange and a store selling Elmo dolls for Christmas. Escorted onto United 564, an overnight flight that would land in Chicago at 5 a.m., she stowed the box in the business-class closet, next to a flight attendant's overcoat.\par \par \uc2 Airplanes carrying donor organs are granted special status, allowing them to move to the front of takeoff lines and ahead of air traffic. Mr. Hil, who tries to avoid routing kidneys on connecting flights and always schedules backups, said none of his registry's transplants had been held up by transportation problems.\par \par \uc2 By the time Ms. Gluchowski's kidney made it to Loyola and was transplanted into Mr. Terry, it had been cold for almost 12 hours. Early studies have found no evidence that shipping live kidneys such distances affects their immediate function.\par \par \uc2 Chain 124 ended at Loyola because Mr. Hil had arranged for the final kidney to go to a hospital that had produced a Good Samaritan donor to start a chain in the past, thus closing a loop. Dr. John Milner, a transplant surgeon at Loyola, said he then selected Mr. Terry to receive the kidney because he was the best immunological match on the hospital's wait list.\par \par \uc2 When Dr. Milner called with the news in early December, Mr. Terry was floored at his remarkable good fortune. Having felt unfairly condemned when he was first placed on dialysis, he now wondered what he had done to deserve a gift that 90,000 others needed just as much.\par \par \uc2 As it sank in that his would be the last of 30 interconnected transplants, Mr. Terry began to feel guilty that he would be ending the chain. ''Is it going to continue?'' he asked Dr. Milner. ''I don't want to be the reason to stop anything.''\par \par \uc2 ''No, no, no,'' the doctor reassured him. ''This chain ends, but another one begins.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: FROM START TO FINISH: A donation by a Good Samaritan, Rick Ruzzamenti, upper left, set in motion a 60-person chain of transplants that ended with a kidney for Donald C.

Burns contributed reporting from London. Lisa Schwartz contributed research.   \par \uc2 1,601 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 February 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OZARK, Mo. -- As she listened to the outlandish story pour out, slightly slurred, from her new husband's mouth, Jessica King dismissed the tale of his family's two-decade run from the law as the product of an overactive imagination and too many drinks.\par \par \uc2 The couple had been married two months, and now Lee King was telling her that his father, a balding local cable technician, was actually an international fugitive who had staged one of England's most infamous bank heists.\par \par \uc2 A few weeks later, on Dec. 28, all doubts vanished. That night, she said her father-in-law appeared at the newlyweds' home, grabbed her arm and, leaning in to fix his eyes on hers, warned her to keep quiet.\par \par \uc2 ''I know you know,'' she said he told her in his native British accent. ''I will kill you. I will bloody kill you.''\par \par \uc2 A day earlier, Ms. King, who recounted these conversations in an interview, had been shocked to discover that her husband's claims might in fact be true.\par \par \uc2 Sitting at a computer with two friends -- who confirmed her account -- she discovered an article about a famous 1993 robbery in England with a picture of the suspect, an armored car driver who made off with the equivalent of $1.5 million and disappeared with his wife and infant son, Lee, into the United States.\par \par \uc2 The man in the photo, identified as Edward Maher, was younger and thinner, with a full head of dark hair, but he was unmistakably her father-in-law, whom she knew as Michael.\par \par \uc2 After almost 20 years as a wanted man in England, the suspect the British tabloids called ''Fast Eddie'' saw his restless run from the law come to an unexpected end last week, his tale of international intrigue emerging in startling contrast to his ordinary life in this mostly rural corner of southwest Missouri.\par \par \uc2 In a few frenetic days the case was cracked, nearly botched, then brought to an unlikely close. Mr. Maher, who had prepared to flee after being accidentally tipped off about the investigation by a police officer, agreed to be taken into custody and acknowledged his real identity, according to court documents.\par \par \uc2 The distance between his worlds was brought into sharp relief when the Ozark police tried to notify their British counterparts, only to discover that their phone plan did not allow overseas dialing.\par \par \uc2 After years of tight-lipped caution, Mr. Maher, 56, was brought down by his talkative son, the 22-year-old Mr. King, who told his wife, she said, that he had been trained to lie as a child to protect the family. Despite that, several people say, Mr. King repeatedly shared his most carefully guarded secret, one so unbelievable that for years no one took him at his word.\par \par \uc2 That changed on Feb. 6 when Ms. King, increasingly terrified of her husband as well as his father, tipped off the local police about the family.\par \par \uc2 In an interview Mr. King denied his wife's version of events, saying he learned about his family's past only last week when his parents showed him his real birth certificate. That, he said, is how he learned his real last name was Brett, his mother's last name, and not -- as is tattooed on both his and his wife's wrists -- King.\par \par \uc2 But in the hours after learning that his father's secret had been revealed, Mr. King sent his wife a barrage of irate text messages accusing her of telling the police, ''things only you know.'' In one of the messages, which she shared to support her story, he lamented his own role in exposing his father. ''It's my fault,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 The crime was as carefully executed as the escape. On Jan. 22, 1993, the authorities say, Mr. Maher disappeared along with an armored car he was driving for Securicor. It was found abandoned a half mile from Lloyds Bank in Felixstowe, on England's east coast, emptied of $:1 million in bills and coins.\par \par \uc2 His wife and 3-year-old son had already left for the United States. The money was never found.\par \par \uc2 Once in the country the family moved constantly, Mr. King said, with stops in New Hampshire, Colorado, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Maher worked regular jobs, including eight years at Nielsen, the television ratings company. His wife, Deborah Brett, who introduced herself variously as Sarah or Barbara (sometimes she couldn't seem to keep the names straight), raised the two children, including a second son, Mark, who was born in the United States and is now a teenager.\par \par \uc2 By all accounts, the family was private and unusually tight knit. Mr. Maher was quiet, with a stern demeanor and a fondness for racial slurs. He seemed to intimidate his family, particularly his doting wife. They spoke rarely, and then only vaguely, about England.\par \par \uc2 About five years ago the family moved to Ozark. As the fastest-growing city in the state, swelling from 4,000 to 18,000 in two decades as it became a popular bedroom community for Springfield, it was an easy place for a newcomer to go unnoticed.\par \par \uc2 Living in a drab housing complex, the family showed few signs of wealth. Mr. Maher worked as a broadband technician at \uc2 Suddenlink\uc2 , a cable company. Ms. Brett cleaned apartments for extra income.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Maher filed for bankruptcy in 2010. Almost $35,000 in debt -- more than he earned in a year -- he listed assets worth just $3,655, including a Mercury Mountaineer with more than 250,000 miles on it. (Ms. Brett once told her son's fiancee that the family used to have more money, but lost it in the stock market.)\par \par \uc2 The family, however, found unexpected fortune last September when Mr. King won $100,000 on a scratch lottery ticket, according to the Missouri Lottery.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile the celebrated case of Fast Eddie had gone cold in England. A story last month in The Ipswich Star, marking the start of his 20th year on the run, suggested that it was unlikely that the police would ever catch ''the man who committed the perfect crime.''\par \par \uc2 Even though no one seemed to be on the tail of his father, a growing number of aggrieved former girlfriends were tracking Mr. King. Each had similar complaints: he was controlling, physically abusive and an almost pathological liar.\par \par \uc2 Though he told each, early in the relationship, that his family was here illegally, his explanations varied.\par \par \uc2 ''He told me that his dad was an assassin,'' said Kayla Jacoby, who had a daughter with Mr. King during their two-year relationship.\par \par \uc2 Mr. King, who has a history of pretending to be a decorated military officer, told the same story to Amanda Zignego, his former fiancee and the mother of two of his children, later threatening to kill her if she shared the secret.\par \par \uc2 When Hannah Evans, his next fiancee, broke off their engagement last September, citing his constant deceptions, he came clean. His father, he confessed, was actually Fast Eddie, a fugitive who, he said, had hijacked an armored car in England.\par \par \uc2 ''I thought it was another lie,'' said Ms. Evans, who is nine months pregnant with his child. ''And of every lie he had ever told me, that was the one where I had to laugh at him.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. King, who is also pregnant and currently living in a safe house, said she turned him in -- and denied doing so in text messages to him -- out of fear for her safety. There was a $:100,000 reward in the case, but it is unclear whether the offer was still valid.\par \par \uc2 David Overcast, the police officer who skeptically took her statement last week, said Ms. King seemed nervous about her safety as she laid out her allegations.\par \par \uc2 ''I've heard a lot of stories over the years and this, right off the bat, was one of the craziest,'' Officer Overcast said.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Maher learned that he had been exposed, he was irate, threatening to kill the informant, according to an F.B.I. affidavit filed in federal court. After vowing to run again, even spending the night at a motel with his wife and younger son, Mr. Maher said last Wednesday that he would not resist arrest, wrote Special Agent Jeffrey W. Atwood.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Maher is being held on federal charges of possessing firearms as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The court determined he was unable to pay for a lawyer. Conversations are under way about extradition, which could take months.\par \par \uc2 A week later, residents still shake their heads at the idea of an international manhunt ending in Ozark. ''It's kind of back to business as usual,'' said the police chief, Lyle Hodges. ''But it was pretty interesting there for a while.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Edward Maher, left, when he drove an armored car, and today.

\par\par \uc2 THE TEXAS TRIBUNE\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc79}{\*\bkmkend toc79}\b \uc2 A Divide On the Payoff Of Legalizing Immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIAN AGUILAR   \par \uc2 771 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 January 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 National Edition\par 23A\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Granting legal status to the illegal immigrants living in one of Texas' largest metropolitan areas would generate at least $1.4 billion a year in revenue for state and federal agencies, with Social Security and Medicare being the largest potential beneficiaries, according to an analysis by a Houston business group.\par \par \uc2 The report, from the Greater Houston Partnership, says that the untapped revenue would be accessible if immigration reform -- one that allowed illegal immigrants the chance to work legally and pay taxes -- was realized. (The Greater Houston Partnership is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)\par \par \uc2 Jeff Moseley, the chief executive of the 2,100-member group, said such reform makes sense in the current economy.\par \par \uc2 ''The law is broken, and employers need to comply with the federal law,'' said Mr. Moseley, a former Denton County judge who ran as a Republican. ''But at the same time, the law needs to be business friendly, and it needs to recognize that there is a job to be done and we depend heavily on these very important workers.''\par \par \uc2 But the report has drawn criticism from advocates of a stricter immigration policy. Maria Martinez, the executive director of the Immigration Reform Coalition of Texas, accused the partnership of being little more than peddlers of economic snake oil for neglecting to account for the financial drain of providing services to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Martinez's group has supported a ban on so-called sanctuary cities in Texas, citing the need to preserve jobs for citizens and the potential financial benefits of removing illegal immigrants from Texas.\par \par \uc2 The partnership's revenue assessment is the result of calculating the additional contributions of the estimated 132,000 illegal immigrants in the Houston area if they and their employers had paid taxes on the estimated $7 billion in salary and wages they earned in 2008. Social Security would receive $852 million and Medicare would receive $206 million. The Department of the Treasury and the Texas Workforce Commission would receive about $336 million and $33 million respectively.\par \par \uc2 The report focuses on the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown metropolitan area, which includes 10 counties. But Patrick Jankowski, the author of the report and the partnership's vice president for research, said the assumptions and methodology could be applied elsewhere because he used data from public sources -- like the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- and the Pew Hispanic Center.\par \par \uc2 The population is an estimate from 2008 based on information from the Pew Hispanic Center, and the analysis is based on that year's earnings.\par \par \uc2 ''If my count on the amount of undocumented workers is too low, the contributions would actually be much higher,'' Mr. Jankowski said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Martinez from the reform coalition, said the business group had simply found a way to create a study without including all the costs.\par \par \uc2 ''The finest business schools in the country train individuals, entrepreneurs, what have you, the importance of transferring costs upon an unsuspecting public,'' Ms. Martinez said. ''That's what's happening obviously here with the Greater Houston Partnership.''\par \par \uc2 Demetrios Papademetriou, the president and co-founder of the Migration Policy Institute, an independent research group in Washington, D.C., said the analysis did not account for how much illegal immigrants cost taxpayers for services. ''You cannot do any accounting exercises unless you work on both sides of the ledger,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Papademetriou said the study would have also benefited from analyzing what an ''equally qualified'' legal resident or citizen was earning in Houston for working the same position as the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For that, stakeholders must turn to a six-year-old study conducted by Carole Keeton Strayhorn, the former state comptroller. That analysis said that if Texas went without the estimated 1.4 million illegal immigrants who lived in the state in 2005, it would have lost about $17.7 billion in gross domestic product that year.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants also produced more in-state revenue, $1.58 billion, than what they cost in state services, $1.16 billion, although local governments lost about $1.44 billion in health-care and law-enforcement costs that were not reimbursed by the state, according to the study by Ms. Strayhorn.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman in the office of Susan Combs, the current comptroller, said the agency had no plans to update the study.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Illegal immigrants return to Mexico after being caught in Arizona.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Times reporters take a closer look at some of the statements made by the Republican presidential candidates in Thursday night's debate.\par \par \uc2 Profiting From the Housing Crisis\par \par \uc2 Seeking to exploit questions over Mitt Romney's investments, Newt Gingrich attacked Mr. Romney tonight for profiting from the housing woes of Florida residents.\par \par \uc2 ''Governor Romney owns shares, has an investment in \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , which is today foreclosing on Floridians,'' Mr. Gingrich charged. ''So maybe Governor Romney, in the spirit of openness, should tell us how much money he's made off of how many households that have been foreclosed by his investments.''\par \par \uc2 The attack is one Mr. Gingrich first unveiled earlier in the day on the campaign trail, when he appeared at a Tea Party rally and responded to Mr. Romney's attacks on him for his consulting work for \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2  by saying, ''Someone who owns stock in a place that forecloses on Floridians has a lot of gall to start raising the issue.''\par \par \uc2 Both charges are misleading.\par \par \uc2 Most of Mr. Romney's assets, along with those of his wife, are held in blind trusts. Those trusts, managed by a trustee without input from Mr. Romney, include among dozens of assets an investment in a \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  fund that in turn invests in mortgage-backed securities. Some of those securities are linked to adjustable-rate mortgages from banks. And some of those banks, or the companies that now own them, are known to be engaged in foreclosure proceedings in Florida, along with other states.\par \par \uc2 To sum up: The Romneys have assets in a blind trust that invests in a fund that invests partly in securities backed by some banks that are attempting or have attempted to foreclose on some people in Florida.\par \par \uc2 But it is not clear how much money -- if any -- Mr. Romney's trusts have earned (or lost) as a result of those investments. And at any rate, those investments would have been made without his knowledge or guidance.\par \par \uc2 -- Nicholas Confessore\par \par \uc2 Israel and the Palestinian People\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romney said President Obama ''threw Israel under the bus'' by criticizing its construction of Jewish settlements while not condemning the hail of rockets sent into Israel from the Gaza Strip. But in December 2008, as a presidential candidate, Mr. Obama referred specifically to these attacks, declaring, ''If somebody was sending rockets into my house, where my two daughters sleep at night, I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that, and I would expect Israelis to do the same thing.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama also condemned rocket attacks on Israel in speeches before the United Nations in 2009 and 2011.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich, repeating a charge he first made in early December, asserted that the Palestinian people were ''technically an invention in the late 1970s.'' But the Palestine Liberation Organization was founded in 1964 to lobby for the rights of the Arab people who had historically lived in lands that became part of Israel. Historians trace the identity of Palestinians back to the early decades of the 20th century.\par \par \uc2 -- Mark Landler\par \par \uc2 Romney Voting Democrat\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney said, ''I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot.''\par \par \uc2 However, he has said that he voted for Senator Paul Tsongas, a Massachusetts Democrat, when he ran in 1992 for the presidential nomination against Bill Clinton, among others.\par \par \uc2 That was the same day, and the same year, that President George H.W. Bush and Pat Buchanan were on the Republican ballot.\par \par \uc2 As an independent, Mr. Romney could have voted in either party's primary, and apparently chose to vote for the Democrat.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romney has said that it was clear that Mr. Bush was going to win the Massachusetts primary -- he did, with 65 percent of the vote -- and that he voted in the Democratic primary simply to try to stop Bill Clinton.\par \par \uc2 (Despite Mr. Romney's support for Mr. Tsongas that year, Mr. Bush has said he supports Mr. Romney now.)\par \par \uc2 -- Katharine Q. Seelye\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie Created the Housing Bubble\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the debate, \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 , the mortgage finance companies now under government conservatorship, came under attack for helping to cause the housing crisis, which is nearly five years old. But that significantly exaggerates their role in the crisis, in the view of numerous nonpartisan analysts. By attacking the companies, rivals of Mr. Gingrich by extension attack him, since his company earned more than $1 million as a consultant for Freddie Mac from 1999 to 2006. So it was that Mr. Romney prominently criticized them, saying, ''\uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2  were a big part of why we have the housing crisis,'' then adding that Mr. Gingrich ''should have been anxiously telling people that these entities were causing a housing bubble that would cause a collapse that we've seen here in Florida and around the country.''\par \par \uc2 Those, especially Republicans, who put much blame on the mortgage finance companies and the federal government say that because of federal mandates that Fannie and Freddie encourage affordable mortgage loans, the companies enabled mortgages to be granted to people who could not afford them and then invested heavily in securities that packaged these subprime loans, many of which went bust. But numerous analysts and reports have shown that Fannie and Freddie belatedly invested in subprime mortgages in 2005 and 2006 because Wall Street firms were way ahead of them and seizing market share. Many of these analysts are hardly fans of the companies but criticize them for other reasons. When it comes to the financial crisis that began in 2007, Fannie and Freddie were more victim than villain, they say.\par \par \uc2 The Times's Joe Nocera has written several columns on the subject, including this one: ''An Inconvenient Truth.''\par \par \uc2 -- Jackie Calmes\par \par \uc2 Gingrich and Balanced Budgets\par \par \uc2 Clearly, Newt Gingrich is not reading the myriad fact-checking articles about these Republican debates. Once again, he incorrectly took credit for four balanced budgets while he was House speaker. But it makes for easy fact checking when we can simply repeat what we have written before. Here is what The Times wrote last week:\par \par \uc2 It is a claim Mr. Gingrich makes almost every day on the campaign trail, but it is based on an odd timeline. The years of balanced budgets in question are from fiscal 1998 through 2001, but Mr. Gingrich was in office for only the first two. He left the House in January 1999 and had no role in crafting the budgets for the subsequent two years.\par \par \uc2 When pressed on this discrepancy, Mr. Gingrich sometimes argues that he deserves credit for policies enacted in the 1990s that promoted economic prosperity and established a climate for balancing budgets that carried beyond his time in office.\par \par \uc2 This is at least the third time The Times has fact-checked this claim. PolitiFact has also looked into it repeatedly, most recently at the last Fox News debate in Iowa in December, when it was rated ''false.''\par \par \uc2 This time makes four. But even before The Times could react, Ron Paul did. Mr. Paul, who was in the House while Mr. Gingrich was speaker, said to him, ''I think you've stretched that a little bit more than you should have.''\par \par \uc2 -- Jackie Calmes\par \par \uc2 Obama's Policy in Latin America\par \par \uc2 Mr. Santorum said President Obama's policy in Latin America was ''abysmal,'' singling out his response to a coup that removed the president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya. Mr. Santorum said the administration sided with leftist leaders like Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Fidel Castro of Cuba over the people of Honduras. In fact, Mr. Zelaya was the legitimately elected leader of Honduras.\par \par \uc2 Some Republicans in Congress called for the United States to recognize Roberto Micheletti, a parliamentary leader who was installed in the presidency. But the White House refused, trying instead to broker a deal to bring Mr. Zelaya home from exile to serve out the remainder of his term. When that failed, the United States accepted the results of a new election, in which a third person, Porfirio Lobo, was elected president.\par \par \uc2 -- Mark Landler\par \par \uc2 'Language of the Ghetto'\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich was asked if he had called Spanish ''the language of the ghetto,'' as a new ad from the Romney campaign suggests.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich said he had not.\par \par \uc2 This is accurate, given the original context of his remarks. Mr. Gingrich said, ''We should replace bilingual education with immersion in English so people learn the common language of the country and they learn the language of prosperity, not the language of living in a ghetto.''\par \par \uc2 Based on that quotation, the Romney campaign ad accused Mr. Gingrich of saying that Spanish ''is the language of the ghetto.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich did not specifically refer to Spanish in that remark, though many assumed that was his intent, and he later apologized for his word choice-in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 -- Michael Barbaro\par \par \uc2 Number of Languages Spoken at Miami Dade College\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich exaggerated when he said 94 languages were spoken at Miami Dade College, but he got the number right just days ago at Monday's debate - 86. His earlier statement - like tonight's, characteristic of Mr. Gingrich, who commonly drops obscure ''facts'' into his rhetoric - prompted the nonpartisan fact checkers at PolitiFact.com to get to work. PolitiFact quoted a college spokesman as saying that in the 2010-11 school year, students spoke 85 languages besides English, for a total of 86. ''We rate this claim verdad, or vrai, or true,'' it said.\par \par \uc2 -- Jackie Calmes\par \par \uc2 Self-Deportation\par \par \uc2 Wolf Blitzer asked Newt Gingrich whether Mitt Romney is anti-immigrant; a Gingrich campaign Spanish-language radio ad called Mr. Romney ''anti-immigrant.''\par \par \uc2 While saying Mr. Romney is ''anti-immigrant'' may be hyperbole, during the primary campaign, Mr. Romney has moved well to the restrictionist right on immigration. He took his ''self-deportation'' idea from groups, like the Federation for American Immigration Reform, that not only oppose benefits for illegal immigrants but also seek big reductions in legal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romney generally rules out any opening for illegal immigrants. His plan is to create an airtight national system of worker verification, based on a secure identity card. Illegal immigrants without cards would not be able to find jobs, Mr. Romney argues, and soon they would pack up and leave-they would ''self-deport.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romney has said that as president he would veto a bill known as the Dream Act, which would give legal status to immigrant students brought to the United States illegally as children, if they finish two years of college or military service. But in Monday night's debate, he said he would approve the Dream Act for those who serve in the military, although not for college students.\par \par \uc2 He opposes state laws like the one in Texas that allows children of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  residents to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romney also welcomed the endorsement of Kris Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas, who was an author of laws based on the self-deportation strategy that were adopted in Arizona and several other states, designed to drive illegal immigrants out of those states.\par \par \uc2 -- Julia Preston\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Newt Gingrich attacked Mitt Romney's investment in a \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  fund.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 9:47 a.m. Updated LOS ANGELES - A chaotic Oscar season found some order on Tuesday as ''The Artist,'' a mostly silent tribute to old Hollywood, and ''Hugo,'' another bit of film nostalgia, joined ''The Descendants,'' about life and love in Hawaii, and ''Midnight in Paris,'' about literary Paris, in scoring an array of major nominations, including those for best picture and best director.\par \par \uc2 In a field of nine best-picture nominees - the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences pegged the number on a sliding scale after experimenting for two years with a list of 10 - ''The Help,'' about race relations; ''War Horse,'' about a fighting horse; ''Moneyball,'' about the business side of baseball; and two surprises, ''The Tree of Life'' and ''Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,'' all found a place. But none showed quite as strong as the leaders.\par \par \uc2 And a host of erstwhile contenders finally fell away, at least in the race for best picture at the 84th Academy Awards ceremony, set for Feb. 26. The full list is here. (To fill out your ballot and compete with friends on NYTimes.com, click here.)\par \par \uc2 The also-rans included Jason Reitman's ''Young Adult,'' George Clooney's ''Ides of March'' and a half-dozen other films that were shaken out by a tough round of Hollywood guild awards and a revised Oscar balloting system.\par \par \uc2 New procedures in the best picture race were designed to nominate movies that garnered a significant core of No. 1 votes, rather than a host of votes for second or third place.\par \par \uc2 By the numbers, this year's most heavily nominated contenders were ''Hugo'' with 11, followed closely by ''The Artist'' with 10. ''Moneyball'' and ''War Horse'' each had 6 nominations, while ''The Descendants,'' though strong in the acting, writing and directing categories, had only 5.\par \par \uc2 A large stack of nominations can sometimes be the Academy's way of acknowledging a very good film that hasn't really won its heart.\par \par \uc2 Last year ''True Grit'' had 10 nominations, including best picture, and ranked just below ''The King's Speech,'' the eventual winner, but took home nothing on Oscar night. ''The Aviator'' and ''Brokeback Mountain'' were the most heavily nominated films in their years but weren't winners.\par \par \uc2 The shockers this year included the fact that the best picture category stretched all the way to 9 of a possible 10 nominees. Oscar-watchers predicted widely that the new counting methods would yield a narrower field.\par \par \uc2 The biggest surprise in the group was almost surely ''Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,'' a drama revolving around the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The film had been snubbed in one after another of the pre-Oscar awards, though its backers, including the producer Scott Rudin, insisted that a devoted core of admirers might turn the film, directed by Stephen Daldry, into a best picture contender.\par \par \uc2 In a seeming disconnect, only one best actress nominee, Viola Davis of ''The Help,'' appeared in a film nominated for best picture. Other nominees in the category were Glenn Close, for playing a woman who played a man in ''Albert Nobbs''; Meryl Streep, as Margaret Thatcher, both in and past her prime, in ''The Iron Lady''; Rooney Mara, as the damaged soul in ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo''; and Michelle Williams, as Marilyn Monroe in ''My Week With Marilyn.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Streep's nomination cemented her position as the most-nominated actor in Academy Awards history, with 17 nominations - far more than the next-most nominated, Jack Nicholson and Katharine Hepburn, with 12 each. Ms. Streep last won an Oscar in 1983, for best actress for ''Sophie's Choice,'' and she was previously best supporting actress in 1980, for ''Kramer vs. Kramer.''\par \par \uc2 Among the best actor nominees, Mr. Clooney (''The Descendants''), Jean Dujardin (''The Artist'') and Brad Pitt (''Moneyball'') appeared in films that have now edged within reach of a best picture Oscar. Demian Bichir, who played an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gardener in ''A Better Life,'' and Gary Oldman, a spy hunter in ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,'' were also nominated.\par \par \uc2 Snubs on the actors list included Leonardo DiCaprio for ''J. Edgar,'' and Michael Fassbender for ''Shame.'' Both films sizzled into the season amid supercharged publicity but wound up with no nominations in the major categories.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, ''Bridesmaids,'' a popular favorite whose cast of female comics was nominated for an ensemble award from the Screen Actors Guild, fell flat with just two major nominations, one for Melissa McCarthy, as best supporting actress, and another for an original screenplay written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo.\par \par \uc2 Other supporting actress nominations went to Berenice Bejo for ''The Artist''; both Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer for ''The Help''; and Janet McTeer for ''Albert Nobbs.''\par \par \uc2 Supporting actor nominees were Kenneth Branagh for ''My Week With Marilyn''; Nick Nolte for ''Warrior''; Jonah Hill for ''Moneyball''; Christopher Plummer for ''Beginners''; and Max von Sydow for ''Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close.''\par \par \uc2 Conventional wisdom among Hollywood's Oscar campaigners says the best director nominations help to identify the real contenders for best picture by culling out movies whose filmmakers did not quite make the cut. By that standard, ''The Help,'' a vastly popular movie with Oscar-friendly themes - about racial bias and conciliation - has a problem, as its director, the relative newcomer Tate Taylor, was snubbed. So was Steven Spielberg, as the director of ''War Horse,'' another best picture nominee.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the directing nominations went to Michel Hazanavicius for ''The Artist''; Alexander Payne for ''The Descendants''; Woody Allen for ''Midnight in Paris''; and Martin Scorsese for ''Hugo,'' along with Terrence Malick for ''The Tree of Life.'' Only Mr. Hazanavicius has not been previously nominated in the category.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scorsese, named best director in 2007 for ''The Departed,'' had perhaps the warmest reception of anyone at the Golden Globes this month when he received an award for directing ''Hugo'' to an outpouring of admiring applause.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Allen, by contrast, did not appear to pick up his Globe for writing ''Midnight in Paris,'' so no one can say whether he too would have set off the kind of Globes-night enthusiasm that foretold an Oscar win for Jeff Bridges, another Hollywood favorite, in 2010.\par \par \uc2 In Tuesday's nominations the surprises included a rare rebuff of Pixar and its chief creative officer, John Lasseter. ''Cars 2,'' which Mr. Lasseter directed, was not among the animation nominees, which in the past have been dominated by Pixar films like ''Ratatouille,'' ''Wall-E'' and ''The Incredibles.\par \par \uc2 Rival DreamWorks Animation had two animated nominees, ''Kung Fu Panda 2'' and ''Puss in Boots.'' Also nominated were ''Rango,'' from \uc2 Paramount Pictures\uc2 , and ''A Cat in Paris'' and ''Chico & Rita,'' both from abroad.\par \par \uc2 The snubs included ''The Adventures of Tintin,'' an ambitious, performance-capture film directed by Mr. Spielberg and produced in partnership with Peter Jackson. It had qualified for consideration in the animation category but was overlooked - perhaps an indication that the Academy's animators are not eager to embrace a hybrid form that combines live action with computer techniques.\par \par \uc2 As has usually been the case in recent years, no foreign-language nominee has found a wide audience in the United States. The nominees in that category are ''Bullhead,'' from Belgium; ''Footnote,'' from Israel; ''In Darkness,'' from Poland; Monsieur Lazhar,'' from Canada; and ''A Separation,'' from Iran. ''Footnote,'' ''In Darkness'' and ''A Separation'' are all backed in the United States by \uc2 Sony\uc2  Pictures Classics, one of the few domestic distributors that still focuses on subtitled films.\par \par \uc2 The year's documentary selections - ''Hell and Back Again,'' ''If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front,'' ''Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory,'' ''Pina'' and ''Undefeated'' - are the last under an old set of rules that allowed very small groups within the Academy's 157-member documentary branch to filter their choices through a selection process that will now be open to wider input and may lean toward choices that have been more widely seen.\par \par \uc2 Among companies, a big winner was \uc2 Sony\uc2  Pictures, which had at least 21 nominations for films from both its major studio and its \uc2 Sony\uc2  Pictures Classics art-house division. Those nominees included ''Midnight in Paris'' and ''Moneyball'' in the best picture category, and a number of nominations for ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'' and ''A Separation.'' Both Paramount and the Weinstein Company had more than a dozen nominations each, and \uc2 Disney\uc2  - though it hasn't been an Oscar powerhouse of late - had at least 13 nominations, including those for ''War Horse'' and ''The Help,'' which were made by its affiliate, DreamWorks.\par \par \uc2 Among the year's screenplay nominations were at least two surprises, ''A Separation,'' the Iranian foreign-language nominee, by Asghar Farhadi about family tensions, and ''Margin Call,'' an indie drama, written by J. C. Chandor, about the financial meltdown.\par \par \uc2 While 9 of the top 10 films at the domestic box office last year were sequels - an unprecedented alignment - only a handful of such follow-up films made an impression on the Academy. ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,'' the year's best-selling film, with more than $1.3 billion in worldwide ticket sales, was nominated only for its art direction, makeup and visual effects, despite an aggressive billboard and radio campaign here that highlighted its awards potential.\par \par \uc2 The Academy's challenge this year is to win over viewers who have not yet warmed to the movies that will be on display when the ceremony is broadcast on ABC. Among the best picture nominees, only ''The Help'' has crossed the $100 million mark at the domestic box office (where it amassed almost $170 million in North American ticket sales and just $36 million elsewhere).\par \par \uc2 If the movies lack drawing power, the Oscar host, Billy Crystal, is at least known for having presided over some of the Academy's most heavily viewed ceremonies, including a 1998 show. That one ran an epic three hours and 47 minutes but drew a record 57.3 million viewers, as ''Titanic'' was named best picture. Last year's ceremony, with hosts James Franco and Anne Hathaway, and more than 30 minutes shorter, drew only about 37.6 million viewers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Crystal, whose screen appearances have been few of late, stepped in after Eddie Murphy dropped out last November, following the sudden resignation of the Hollywood bad-boy Brett Ratner as one of the show's producers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ratner had caused a stir for some sex talk on the radio and for using an anti-gay slur at a public appearance in Los Angeles. He was quickly replaced by Brian Grazer, a veteran film producer who has largely refrained from public discussion of his plans for the show, in an effort to preserve some surprise in the proceedings.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Correction: January 27, 2012, Friday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the Academy Award nominations misstated the number received by films made by \uc2 Disney\uc2  or its DreamWorks affiliate. It is 13, not 11.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Nine films have been nominated for the Academy Award for best picture this year.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER -- A review ordered by the Obama administration of virtually all 7,900 deportation cases before the immigration court here has identified about 1,300 foreigners -- 16 percent -- who pose no security risk and will be allowed to remain in the United States, although with no new legal status, immigration officials said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 It was a fast-paced test run of the first comprehensive docket review in the nation's immigration courts. Department of Homeland Security officials plan to extend it in coming months to all of about 300,000 deportation cases before the courts nationwide.\par \par \uc2 The court review is part of a broad effort by the administration, as President Obama heads into his re-election campaign, to ease the impact of enforcement on immigrant and Latino communities by stopping some deportations while also reducing huge backlogs swamping the immigration courts. Based on an early projection of results from pilot projects here and in Baltimore, as many as 39,000 immigrants across the country could see their deportation cases closed.\par \par \uc2 Officials said that number, though only a fraction of nearly 1.2 million deportations in the last three years, would be enough to show that Mr. Obama had heard increasingly bitter complaints from immigrant groups about families separated by removals since he took office.\par \par \uc2 While the administration's strategy was generally welcomed by immigrant organizations, advocates said they were frustrated that many of those permitted to stay would be left in an indefinite limbo where they could not work or obtain driver's licenses and might struggle to subsist.\par \par \uc2 ''They will be in immigration purgatory,'' said Hans Meyer, an immigration lawyer in Denver.\par \par \uc2 On another side, Republicans say Mr. Obama is doing an end run around Congress with the prosecutorial discretion policy. ''This is part of a pattern of granting de facto amnesty to the more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States by the president's refusal to enforce U.S. immigration laws,'' said Representative Elton Gallegly, the Republican from California who is chairman of the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials this month also proposed streamlining the procedures by which illegal immigrants with American family members apply for legal residency.\par \par \uc2 In a blitz that started Dec. 5, 16 immigration prosecutors in Denver, laboring long days and weekends, read through looming stacks of paper files to meet a mid-January deadline set by the Department of Homeland Security in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Despite the immense workload, prosecutors said they liked their newfound flexibility in pursuing cases -- more like the routine practice of their peers in criminal courts. Each minor case closed clears time on the court's jammed calendar for an immigration judge to expel a convicted sex offender or gang member, prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 ''It makes us feel good to know that some of these low-priority cases will be placed at the back burner,'' said Corina Almeida, who, as chief counsel for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Denver, is the senior prosecutor here. ''These cases free up others to move to the front of the line: the egregious offenders, those who thumb their noses at the system or commit fraud.''\par \par \uc2 Under a policy unveiled in June by John Morton, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the agency's officers are asked to be more discriminating with its resources, using prosecutorial discretion to hasten deportations of criminals while avoiding illegal immigrants charged only with civil violations who have strong family bonds in the country.\par \par \uc2 ''If the only thing they did is enter illegally, they have established ties, they have U.S. citizen children, they are productive members of society, they have no criminal records, it makes prosecutors feel good when you know you can do something,'' Ms. Almeida said. ''They don't have to worry about someone knocking on their door.''\par \par \uc2 But as the pilot project unfolded here, it became clear that ICE prosecutors, while closing deportations, were not offering any new legal status that would allow immigrants to work or drive legally or receive college assistance.\par \par \uc2 Among the first to benefit under the Denver review was a student from Mexico whose parents had brought him to Colorado when he was 9. The student, Jesus Gerardo Noriega, now 21, was put in deportation proceedings after a traffic officer pulled him over for a burned-out license plate light. A 2006 Colorado law requires state and local police to report any suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to ICE.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Noriega met the standard for prosecutorial discretion in several ways: his parents are legal residents, and his three brothers are American citizens. His application for residency is stalled in the system. He graduated from high school and wants to go to college -- to study automotive engineering to design energy-efficient cars, he specified.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Noriega was arrested 12 days before he would have completed 10 years living in the United States, when he would have become eligible to have his deportation canceled definitively, his lawyer, Mr. Meyer, said.\par \par \uc2 ''My parents didn't want me sent back, and they wanted to see me again,'' Mr. Noriega said, recalling the days when he was detained. ''We've always been a close family, and having your son put in jail and taken away from you definitely brought sadness and depression to the house.''\par \par \uc2 He learned just before the holidays that his deportation had been suspended. ''I thought it must have been a miracle,'' Mr. Noriega said.\par \par \uc2 But he is worried that without being able to work or drive, he cannot enroll in the courses he needs for the automotive degree.\par \par \uc2 ''It definitely is a step forward,'' he said. ''But at the same time, I don't think it's a solution.''\par \par \uc2 Administration officials said they were going as far as they could under existing laws and would continue to press Congress for legislation giving legal status to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 After being chosen for discretion, an immigrant must pass background checks against federal criminal and national security databases. Then ICE prosecutors offer to file a joint motion with the immigrant to close the deportation case. If both sides agree, the approval of an immigration judge is relatively quick.\par \par \uc2 The deportation then becomes a ''sleeping beauty,'' one ICE prosecutor said; it is closed and off the docket, but in theory it can be reopened at any time.\par \par \uc2 Judges and court administrators here were cheered by the prospect of reduced backlogs. With six immigration judges handling on average more than 1,300 cases each, the Denver courts are among the most clogged in the nation, and immigrants wait as long as 18 months for a hearing.\par \par \uc2 Another case closed in Denver was that of Raul Cardenas, who came here illegally from Mexico. He has been married for 11 years to an American citizen, and he and his wife, Judy, are raising three children, all citizens.\par \par \uc2 After eight years in a job driving heavy tunnel-boring machinery, Mr. Cardenas was arrested in 2009 when ICE determined that the Social Security number he had presented belonged to someone else. All serious criminal charges against him were dismissed, but he was placed in deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 ''It was an absolute violation of the security and safety of my family,'' said Mrs. Cardenas, a public school kindergarten teacher. With the help of their Unitarian Universalist church, they held rallies, petitioned lawmakers and sought support on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. and Mrs. Cardenas said they were greatly relieved that his deportation was stopped. But they remain frustrated, since he cannot get authorization to work.\par \par \uc2 ''It's anxiety-filled limbo,'' Mrs. Cardenas said.\par \par \uc2 In cases where discretion was denied, prosecutors and lawyers said, ICE leaned toward caution, passing over many immigrants who did not have criminal records but also did not show deep ties to the United States.\par \par \uc2 In many cases, lawyers for illegal immigrants are not accepting prosecutors' offers because the immigrants have good chances of winning legal residency in court. Laura Lichter, the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, who practices in Denver, said ICE could have done far more to reduce backlogs by rapidly completing those strong cases.\par \par \uc2 ''It is a major undertaking,'' she said of the docket review. ''But it is also a major lost opportunity.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Jesus Gerardo Noriega, a student who was facing deportation, at his home in Aurora, Colo., last week.(A13); Deportation proceedings against Raul Cardenas, here with his wife, Judy, last week at their Denver home, were halted.; Lynn Marrero, an assistant chief counsel in Denver, reviewed her files for cases to apply prosecutorial discretion.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES -- You're nobody till somebody snubs you. Especially when it comes to this year's film awards.\par \par \uc2 In a prize season that has already seen plenty of slights, the Directors Guild of America on Monday snubbed Steven Spielberg, with his ''War Horse,'' and Tate Taylor, with ''The Help.'' It handed its bellwether award nominations to Woody Allen, for ''Midnight in Paris''; David Fincher, for ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo''; Michel Hazanavicius, for ''The Artist''; Alexander Payne, for ''The Descendants''; and Martin Scorsese, for ''Hugo.''\par \par \uc2 With that, all Hollywood's major guilds have listed their nominees for pre-Oscar prizes. And they have managed to set the lines of an Academy Awards race that could be remembered less for its winners than for a large array of high-profile contenders who will be struggling -- right up until the Oscar nominations are announced later this month -- to avoid embarrassment.\par \par \uc2 By this time last year, ''The King's Speech'' had been all but crowned best picture, and the 2010 contest by January had turned into a match between ''The Hurt Locker,'' which ultimately won, and ''Avatar,'' which didn't. This time around, more than a dozen pictures and their components are continuing to jostle for position in a chaotic contest.\par \par \uc2 So far, it appears to put at least three widely honored films -- ''The Artist,'' a mostly silent fable about old Hollywood; ''The Help,'' about the civil rights awakening among Southern women; and ''The Descendants,'' about the complications of land and family in Hawaii -- within striking distance of the best picture Oscar on Feb. 26.\par \par \uc2 But each of those movies has a soft spot.\par \par \uc2 The directors' guild omission apparently indicates that Mr. Taylor's work on ''The Help'' is less admired than the film's cast and its theme of racial conciliation. ''The Artist,'' with just $7 million at the domestic box office, has yet to find an audience. ''The Descendants'' has a low-key story with less action than any winner since ''American Beauty,'' in 2000.\par \par \uc2 So hope remains alive for several films -- particularly ''Midnight in Paris,'' ''Hugo'' and ''War Horse,'' but also ''Bridesmaids'' and ''Moneyball'' among them-- that might still slip past the others for a win. But to prevail, they must first make the list of 5 to 10 best picture nominees under this year's new set of counting procedures. To do that, they'll need to muster roughly 250 first-place votes, from a potential pool of about 5,800 Oscar ballots.\par \par \uc2 Above all, they must avoid the kind of unhappy surprises that have afflicted contenders like ''Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,'' which was shut out by the guilds for writers, directors, actors and producers alike, though it picked up four nominations, including best picture, for the Critics' Choice Movie Awards, which are being awarded on Thursday and have often tracked closely with the Oscars. ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' has been similarly embarrassed by the guilds.\par \par \uc2 If not looking like a loser is this year's version of winning, Meryl Streep has already won, for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in ''The Iron Lady.'' The nearly snub-proof Ms. Streep has received an array of nominations, awards or other recognition from the Screen Actors Guild, the Golden Globes and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, along with another dozen or so critics' groups.\par \par \uc2 But others can claim similar praise, including Viola Davis for her work in ''The Help,'' Michelle Williams for ''My Week With Marilyn,'' Glenn Close for ''Albert Nobbs'' and Tilda Swinton for ''We Need to Talk About Kevin.''\par \par \uc2 The real sport may lie in spotting which of them might be crowded out to make room for a surprise nominee, like Rooney Mara of ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'' or Kristin Wiig of ''Bridesmaids.'' Michael Fassbender, heavily promoted by \uc2 Fox Searchlight\uc2  for his performance as a sex addict in ''Shame,'' was snubbed by the actors' guild this year. Alongside favorites like George Clooney, for ''The Descendants,'' and Jean Dujardin, for ''The Artist,'' the guild instead nominated Demian Bichir for his portrayal of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gardener in the nearly microscopic drama ''A Better Life.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Bichir and his film, in turn, were snubbed by the other guilds, while Brad Pitt, the leading actor in ''Moneyball,'' has been edging aside Brad Pitt, the lead (or supporting actor, depending on who does the scoring) in ''The Tree of Life.''\par \par \uc2 By mid-January of last year, the acting categories were pretty much locked up, with Natalie Portman looking like a winner for ''Black Swan'' and Colin Firth a sure bet for ''The King's Speech.''\par \par \uc2 Not charmed by the uncertainty, the movie audience so far has stayed home. As the year ended, a field of about 15 late-season awards contenders -- not counting animated films like ''The Adventures of Tintin'' and ''Happy Feet 2'' -- took in about a third less in domestic ticket sales than perhaps a dozen such movies last year.\par \par \uc2 On Academy Awards night, so the hopeful thinking goes here, viewers may turn up anyway, looking for surprises.\par \par \uc2 ''That helps the show,'' Bill Mechanic, a producer of the 2010 ceremony, said of a lack of consensus about the prospects for top awards. But, Mr. Mechanic said, the program would be helped still more if a wide audience had actually seen the movies ''and thus had a rooting interest in the winners.''\par \par \uc2 (A couple of story lines to watch for: If ''The Artist'' were to win, it would be the first virtually silent best picture since 1928. ''The Help,'' from DreamWorks through its \uc2 Walt Disney\uc2  Studios alliance, would be \uc2 Disney\uc2 's first winner other than those separately distributed by \uc2 Miramax Films\uc2  when it was owned by \uc2 Disney\uc2 .)\par \par \uc2 Still, when the Oscar nominations are announced at 5:30 a.m. Pacific time on Jan. 24, savvy watchers can check who gets left behind.\par \par \uc2 Will Steven Spielberg be passed over as the director of ''War Horse''? Can Diablo Cody's script for ''Young Adult,'' the film's only guild nomination, save it from a shutout? Will Clint Eastwood, Leonardo DiCaprio and ''J. Edgar'' join the also-rans? Is Madonna's ''W.E.,'' one of the year's glamour projects when it had its debut in Venice a few short months ago, headed for the abyss? (There, it would join Werner Herzog's critically admired ''Into the Abyss,'' which did not make the shortlist of 15 Oscar-eligible documentaries.)\par \par \uc2 Those and other questions will be settled by the Oscar ballots, due on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Until then, just find yourself somebody to snub.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Among the nominees for best director announced on Monday by the Directors Guild were Michel Hazanavicius for ''The Artist,'' starring Jean Dujardin, top, and Alexander Payne for ''The Descendants'' (with, center, from left, Shailene Woodley, George Clooney, Amara Miller and Nick Krause), but not Tate Taylor for ''The Help,'' above, with Viola Davis.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc84}{\*\bkmkend toc84}\b \uc2 Agents' Union Delays Training On New Policy On Deportation\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON   \par \uc2 1,269 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 January 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The federal agency in charge of deportations is conducting a far-reaching training course to push immigration enforcement officers and prosecutors nationwide to focus their efforts on removing immigrants convicted of crimes.\par \par \uc2 The training course is the clearest sign yet that administration officials want to transform the way immigration officers work, asking them to make nuanced decisions to speed deportations of high-risk offenders while halting those of illegal immigrants with clean records and strong ties to the country. The policy is President Obama's most ambitious immigration initiative before the November elections, senior administration officials said.\par \par \uc2 But in a new sign of the deep dissension over immigration, the union representing some 7,000 deportation officers of the agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, has so far not allowed its members to participate in the training. Without the formal assent of the union, the administration's strategy could be significantly slowed for months in labor negotiations.\par \par \uc2 Chris Crane, the president of the union, the National ICE Council, has fiercely criticized the strategy, saying it amounts to orders from ICE officials for agents not to enforce the law. In Congressional testimony, Mr. Crane accused the administration of tailoring its enforcement practices to win support from immigrant communities for Mr. Obama's re-election.\par \par \uc2 ''Law enforcement and public safety have taken a back seat to attempts to satisfy immigrant advocacy groups,'' Mr. Crane told a House Judiciary subcommittee in October.\par \par \uc2 Department of Homeland Security officials say the training seminar, although only half a day, is central to bringing all ICE officers on board for an effort that they say will significantly raise the numbers of convicted criminals among deportees and is expected to lead in coming months to unprecedented suspensions of deportations of tens of thousands of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Virtually all ICE commanding officers and prosecutors have gone through the training course and are working on the new strategy, Homeland Security Department officials said. But because of the silence from the ICE Council, a local of the American Federation of Government Employees, the officials will miss their Jan. 13 goal for completing the nationwide training blitz, which began in November.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Crane has channeled his criticisms primarily through Republican leaders in Congress, working with Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Calling the administration's plan ''backdoor amnesty,'' Mr. Smith said last week that evidence Mr. Crane presented to the committee showed that directives from ICE officials for agents to use discretion in enforcement decisions had ''undermined the agency's credibility and mission.''\par \par \uc2 The National ICE Council faces a deadline late this month to say whether it will demand negotiations over the training, the officials said. Mr. Crane did not respond to repeated e-mail requests over several months for comment.\par \par \uc2 On another side, the administration is facing intense pressure from Latino leaders and immigrant organizations to begin halting deportations.\par \par \uc2 The cornerstone of the policy is a June 17 memorandum by John Morton, the director of ICE, in which he laid out a list of no fewer than 31 factors that ICE officers should weigh when deciding whether to proceed with a deportation. Peter S. Vincent, ICE's top lawyer, added further guidelines on Nov. 17.\par \par \uc2 With slide shows and chalk talks on a dozen hypothetical immigration cases, the training seminar challenges officers to decide which foreigners should be deported, using prosecutorial discretion to make more complex decisions than they have in decades. It instructs agents to focus on the worst offenders, including criminal convicts, gang members and foreigners who came back after being expelled. Other groups of immigrants -- elderly people, children, military veterans, college students and parents of young citizens -- are low priorities who can be allowed to stay, even if they are here illegally. A New York Times reporter sat through an abbreviated version of the seminar.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the policy was based on existing statutes and was intended to make good use of strained resources. With each deportation costing at least $23,000, she said, immigration agencies have money for 400,000 removals each year, a goal that the Obama administration has met in each of the past three years. But an estimated 11 million immigrants live here illegally.\par \par \uc2 The training asks ICE agents what they should do, for example, with a young \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  turned over to the agency after being arrested by a state trooper for driving without a license. She has been living in this country since 1993 and has an infant son, an American citizen because he was born here. But she lied to ICE officers, failing to tell them she had a conviction for shoplifting in 1995.\par \par \uc2 Answer: She is not a threatening criminal and may still be nursing her American baby. Officers should close her deportation case.\par \par \uc2 How about the migrant who has been living here since he crossed the Southwest border illegally in 1996? He failed to appear for a crucial immigration court hearing back then. But he has no criminal record, and he coaches soccer at the school where his twin daughters, both citizens, are enrolled.\par \par \uc2 Answer: This case, too, should be closed.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the man from an Asian Pacific island, a legal resident of the United States since 1984 who even served two distinguished combat tours in Iraq. But he left the military and is now finishing a six-year prison sentence for a federal sex-trafficking felony.\par \par \uc2 Answer: Despite his service, because of his grave sex offense he loses his resident status and will be sent by ICE to his birth country.\par \par \uc2 Cases against illegal immigrants who win favorable prosecutorial discretion will be closed but not canceled, so ICE can easily reopen them. Mr. Morton said the immigrants would remain in ''legal limbo,'' not gaining any legal immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Crane told Congress that the Morton directives presented enforcement agents with ''a roller coaster of arrest authority that has changed from month to month, week to week and at times from day to day.'' He said some agents were afraid to make any arrests.\par \par \uc2 It is not clear how deeply the union's resistance reaches into ICE ranks. ICE officials say many field agents have been drawn to the professional appeal of the high-profile anticrime operations against foreign street gangs, drug dealers and sex offenders that the agency is conducting ever more frequently.\par \par \uc2 ''Our folks understand that we have limited resources and we have to focus more than ever on our priorities,'' said Chris Shanahan, the ICE field office director who oversees deportation operations in New York City, where all supervisors have had the training.\par \par \uc2 ''What I see from my officers,'' Mr. Shanahan said, ''is that they understand that criminal aliens and national security threats should be taken into custody and removed before a single mother, a pregnant woman or someone with small United States citizen children.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: January 15, 2012, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption last Sunday with an article about questions over a new policy to focus on illegal immigrants with criminal backgrounds misstated, in some editions, the credentials of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. They are supervising ICE agents, not future ICE agents.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Supervising agents listening last month to John Morton, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is asking its staff to make nuanced decisions on when to initiate deportation proceedings.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 There used to be just two Stephen Colberts, and they were hard enough to distinguish. The main difference was that one thought the other was an idiot. The idiot Colbert was the one who made a nice paycheck by appearing four times a week on ''The Colbert Report'' (pronounced in the French fashion, with both t's silent), the extremely popular fake news show on \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2 . The other Colbert, the non-idiot, was the 47-year-old South Carolinian, a practicing Catholic, who lives with his wife and three children in suburban Montclair, N.J., where, according to one of his neighbors, he is ''extremely normal.'' One of the pleasures of attending a live taping of ''The Colbert Report'' is watching this Colbert transform himself into a Republican superhero.\par \par \uc2 Suburban Colbert comes out dressed in the other Colbert's guise -- dark two-button suit, tasteful Brooks Brothersy tie, rimless Rumsfeldian glasses -- and answers questions from the audience for a few minutes. (The questions are usually about things like Colbert's favorite sport or favorite character from ''The Lord of the Rings,'' but on one memorable occasion a young black boy asked him, ''Are you my father?'' Colbert hesitated a moment and then said, ''Kareem?'') Then he steps onstage, gets a last dab of makeup while someone sprays his hair into an unmussable Romney-like helmet, and turns himself into his alter ego. His body straightens, as if jolted by a shock. A self-satisfied smile creeps across his mouth, and a manically fatuous gleam steals into his eyes.\par \par \uc2 Lately, though, there has emerged a third Colbert. This one is a version of the TV-show Colbert, except he doesn't exist just on screen anymore. He exists in the real world and has begun to meddle in it. In 2008, the old Colbert briefly ran for president, entering the Democratic primary in his native state of South Carolina. (He hadn't really switched parties, but the filing fee for the Republican primary was too expensive.) In 2010, invited by Representative Zoe Lofgren, he testified before Congress about the problem of \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  farmworkers and remarked that ''the obvious answer is for all of us to stop eating fruits and vegetables.''\par \par \uc2 But those forays into public life were spoofs, more or less. The new Colbert has crossed the line that separates a TV stunt from reality and a parody from what is being parodied. In June, after petitioning the Federal Election Commission, he started his own super PAC -- a real one, with real money. He has run TV ads, endorsed (sort of) the presidential candidacy of Buddy Roemer, the former governor of Louisiana, and almost succeeded in hijacking and renaming the Republican primary in South Carolina. ''Basically, the F.E.C. gave me the license to create a killer robot,'' Colbert said to me in October, and there are times now when the robot seems to be running the television show instead of the other way around.\par \par \uc2 ''It's bizarre,'' remarked an admiring Jon Stewart, whose own program, ''The Daily Show,'' immediately precedes ''The Colbert Report'' on \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2  and is where the Colbert character got his start. ''Here is this fictional character who is now suddenly interacting in the real world. It's so far up its own rear end,'' he said, or words to that effect, ''that you don't know what to do except get high and sit in a room with a black light and a poster.''\par \par \uc2 In August, during the run-up to the Ames straw poll, some Iowans were baffled to turn on their TVs and see a commercial that featured shots of ruddy-cheeked farm families, an astronaut on the moon and an ear of hot buttered corn. It urged viewers to cast write-in votes for Rick Perry by spelling his name with an ''a'' -- ''for America.'' A voice-over at the end announced that the commercial had been paid for by an organization called Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow, which is the name of Colbert's super PAC, an entity that, like any other super PAC, is entitled to raise and spend unlimited amounts of soft money in support of candidates as long as it doesn't ''coordinate'' with them, whatever that means. Of such super-PAC efforts, Colbert said, ''This is 100 percent legal and at least 10 percent ethical.''\par \par \uc2 Just as baffling as the Iowa corn ads -- at least to the uninitiated -- were some commercials Colbert produced taking the side of the owners during the recent N.B.A. lockout. These were also sponsored by Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow, but they were ''made possible,'' according to the voice-over, by Colbert Super PAC SHH Institute. Super PAC SHH (as in ''hush'') is Colbert's 501(c)(4). He has one of those too -- an organization that can accept unlimited amounts of money from corporations without disclosing their names and can then give that money to a regular PAC, which would otherwise be required to report corporate donations. ''What's the difference between that and money laundering?'' Colbert said to me delightedly.\par \par \uc2 In the case of Colbert's N.B.A. ads, the secret sugar daddy might, or might not, have been Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, who has appeared on the show and whom the ads call a ''hero.'' We'll never know, and that of course is the point. Referring to the Supreme Court ruling that money is speech, and therefore corporations can contribute large sums to political campaigns, Colbert said, ''Citizens United said that transparency would be the disinfectant, but (c)(4)'s are warm, wet, moist incubators. There is no disinfectant.''\par \par \uc2 Colbert's abettor in his super-PAC efforts is, of all people, Trevor Potter, a Washington lawyer who is a former chairman of the F.E.C. and was general counsel to John McCain during the 2000 and 2008 presidential campaigns and has become Colbert's personal lawyer. ''T. Potts,'' as Colbert sometimes calls him, is a bit of a performer himself and is now a regular on the show. Colbert once toyed with enlisting a smoke machine to enhance his entrances.\par \par \uc2 ''Aren't lawyers allowed to have fun?'' Potter asked me a few weeks ago, adding that he knew what he was signing up for by appearing on the show. He also said he thought that Colbert was serving a useful function. ''I'm very careful not to ascribe motive to him -- he can speak for himself,'' he said. ''I don't know what he's thinking. He can find the laws ironic or funny or absurd. But he's illustrating how the system works by using it. By starting a super PAC, creating a (c)4, filing with the F.E.C., he can bring the audience inside the system. He can show them how it works and then leave them to conclude whether this is how it ought to work.''\par \par \uc2 Colbert says that education isn't his aim with the super PAC -- being funny is. Nevertheless, he proudly showed me that if you \uc2 Google\uc2  the phrase ''super PAC,'' his name is one of the first that shows up, and the evolution of his super PAC has lately been the show's big, ongoing narrative. As Potter pointed out, when Colbert began his super PAC, he wasn't sure how a super PAC worked; he just knew he wanted one. Now he is full of plans, most of them confidential, for more ''grand actions,'' as he calls them.\par \par \uc2 Colbert declined to tell me how much money was in his super PAC's treasury, pointing out that ''that's what PACs do -- they don't have to tell you.'' But there are almost 170,000 names on the super PAC's e-mail list, and some 30,000 people have given him money.\par \par \uc2 In October, Colbert offered the Republican Party in South Carolina $400,000 to defray the cost of the presidential primary there in January in return for naming rights -- he wanted the ballots, the lanyards, the press credentials to say ''The Stephen Colbert Super PAC South Carolina Primary'' -- and for a nonbinding referendum question that asked the voters to decide whether ''corporations are people'' or ''only people are people.'' This issue has been Colbert's hobbyhorse since August, when Mitt Romney told a heckler that ''corporations are people, my friend,'' and needless to say, Colbert too is on the side of corporate personhood. ''Just because someone was born in a lawyer's office and is incorporeal doesn't mean he should have no rights,'' he likes to say.\par \par \uc2 ''I figured that if they'd sell me the naming rights, they'd probably be willing to sell me a referendum,'' Colbert told me. ''I always assume that anything that could be for sale probably is.''\par \par \uc2 Amazingly, the South Carolina Republicans were on the point of agreeing to Colbert's proposal, and ballots were printed that included the referendum question, when the state Supreme Court ruled that the counties, not the party, had to pay for the primary and that the ballot could not include referendum questions. When the Republicans declined to pursue the matter, Colbert made the same offer to the state's Democrats, who filed an appeal. Even Colbert seemed a little surprised, pointing out that he had repeatedly warned both the Republicans and the Democrats that his aims were satirical and that their very willingness to negotiate with him could become a joke on the show. ''It turns out that both sides are happy to take my money,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In late December, in an op-ed for a South Carolina newspaper, Colbert sweetened the deal to $500,000 if the Republicans would reconsider, join the Democrats in appealing the ruling and give him his naming rights and the referendum question. ''Call it a Christmas miracle,'' he wrote. ''I've already filled out the check, and to prove it's no joke, I've written 'No Joke' in the memo line.''\par \par \uc2 The Colbert character, whose taped descent, godlike, from the empyrean while clutching an American flag begins every show, was originally intended as a takeoff on Fox News figures like Sean Hannity and especially Bill O'Reilly. Though Colbert doesn't much resemble O'Reilly physically, the persona has mastered some of O'Reilly's pen-wielding, hand-stabbing gestures, and his credentials as a right-wing blowhard are beyond doubt. He thinks that gays will go to hell, that a flaming moat should be built around America to keep out immigrants and that Christianity is, or ought to be, the official national religion. He believes not in truth but in ''truthiness,'' a term of his own invention.\par \par \uc2 Over the six years that ''The Colbert Report'' has been in existence, this character has developed an elaborate identity of his own, leaving O'Reilly and the others far behind, and has achieved heights of renown seemingly denied to television personalities who aren't made up. The Colbert character has appeared, clad in a skintight speed-skating suit, on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Like O'Reilly, he has published a best-selling book, ''I Am America (And So Can You!),'' but he has also guest-edited an issue of Newsweek and once wrote Maureen Dowd's column in The Times (and, while he was at it, Frank Rich's by adding the words ''It's all George Bush's fault, the vice president is Satan and God is gay''). There is a Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor named after Colbert (Colbert's Americone Dream) and a NASA exercise device (the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Elliptical Trainer, or Colbert) and a minor-league hockey team mascot (Steagle Colbeagle the Eagle) in Saginaw, Mich. There would have been a bridge in Hungary named after him, after he encouraged his followers to submit his name in an online contest, but government officials decided at the last minute that the winner could not be living or someone not fluent in Hungarian.\par \par \uc2 Fittingly, ''The Colbert Report'' itself began as a joke of sorts. In 2003 ''The Daily Show,'' on which Colbert was a regular, began running brief commercials for something called ''The Colbert Report,'' which promised to drive ''straight past the issues.'' The show didn't exist, nor at the time were there any plans for it. These bits were mostly just a jab at O'Reilly. But in 2005 Stewart persuaded \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2  to think about doing the show for real and Colbert was given an eight-week tryout, which proved so successful that ''The Colbert Report,'' minus the French accent, quickly became a fixture in the late-night lineup.\par \par \uc2 The blustering O'Reilly-like persona is an outgrowth of a character Colbert had been playing on ''The Daily Show'' almost since the beginning, and briefly on the short-lived ''Dana Carvey Show'' before that: a self-important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop. The models Colbert had in mind were people like Stone Phillips, Bill Kurtis and especially Geraldo Rivera. ''I loved the way Geraldo made reporting a story seem like an act of courage,'' he told me.\par \par \uc2 After Jon Stewart took over from Craig Kilborn as host of ''The Daily Show'' in 1999, he encouraged Colbert to make the character more political, perhaps by incorporating some of the opinionated know-nothingism he routinely displayed in a point-counterpoint segment called ''Even Stevphen,'' in which he and Steve Carell (also a regular, before he moved on to ''The Office'') used to debate things like Islam vs. Christianity and the goodness or badness of the weather, shouting things like ''Yes!'' ''No!'' and ''Shut up!'' at each other. At first Colbert resisted a little. ''I thought topical stuff had an ephemeral quality -- it would be meaningless in a week,'' he told me. ''I wanted my character to be eternal.''\par \par \uc2 Stewart said: ''What he says is all lies. I didn't push him, I berated him. If I remember correctly, there was physical punishment.'' Then he added, seriously, ''It was an attempt to change the editorial environment a little -- a question of aiming the flamethrowers.''\par \par \uc2 Stewart also recalled that Colbert worried at first that the ''Report'' might not be sustainable, and says he kept pointing out, '' 'I don't know anyone more interesting than you. You know so much about so many different areas.' '' Stewart went on: ''I'm not at all surprised that the show is good -- he's amazing at it. He's able to weave a character in a way that's never been done on television before -- rendering this fictional character in 3-D, live, in such a way that he's still able to retain his humanity.'' The extra dimension, he explained, is the other Colbert, the real one. ''The third dimension is him. That's the thing we started to see here. He is so interesting, smart and decent. He's a good person, and that allows his character to be criminally, negligently ignorant.''\par \par \uc2 The Colbert on-screen persona is actually less rigid than it used to be, and Colbert can dial it up or down as he chooses. There is now more of a winking quality to the act, a sense that we're all in on the joke. And in the last part of the show, when Colbert typically leaps up from his desk and bounds across the set to a table in front of a fireplace with the Latin motto ''Videri quam esse'' (''To seem to be, rather than to be''), where he interviews a guest about a new book or movie, he usually tamps the character down enough to allow the guest a few minutes to get his or her own message across.\par \par \uc2 When Harry Belafonte was on recently, for example, Colbert cut him some admiring slack and even joined in singing ''Jamaica Farewell,'' instead of ripping into Belafonte for being a lefty agitator. A month earlier, in September, the Colbert presence was so friendly and relaxed that Al Gore, on to talk about the Climate Reality Project, forgot himself and violated the show's cardinal rule -- he broke the fictional wall. Talking about Keith Olbermann, Gore said, ''He scares Fox News, and he scares your character, as he should.'' ''My character?'' Colbert cried in mock bewilderment.\par \par \uc2 Colbert is not Ali G. He doesn't sandbag the unsuspecting. And he is particularly careful to visit guests beforehand in the green room and prepare them for what's going to happen. When John Lithgow was on recently to promote his new memoir, ''Drama,'' Colbert warned him that his character would become the biggest jerk Lithgow had ever met. ''Just pretend I'm the drunk in a bar who won't shut up,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 But in the early days of the show, when Colbert's persona was more earnest and deadpan, and when people were less used to it, there were some memorably strange and awkward moments. In 2005, the show's first season, Colbert interviewed a humorless and expressionless Barney Frank, who said, ''Ignorance does not offend me'' when Colbert seemed surprised to discover that he was gay. A moment later Frank threw up his hands and declined to proceed, saying that the questioning had become too dumb to take seriously.\par \par \uc2 But easily the most awkward moment in Colbert's career, and also in many ways a defining one, was his appearance at the White House Correspondents' Dinner in 2006. Mark Smith, an A.P. reporter who, as head of the correspondents' association, was responsible for booking the talent, admitted later that he wasn't all that familiar with the show, which was only three months old when he approached Colbert. Neither, to judge from video of the event, were many in the audience. Colbert got up and addressed the president, saying: ''I stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only for things. He stands on things. Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares. And that sends a powerful message: that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound -- with the most powerfully staged photo-ops in the world.''\par \par \uc2 Never cracking a smile or breaking out of character, he went on to praise Bush for believing ''the same thing Wednesday that he believed on Monday, no matter what happened on Tuesday'' and to point out that the administration wasn't sinking but soaring. ''If anything,'' he said, ''they are rearranging the deck chairs on the Hindenburg.'' Nor did he leave out the correspondents themselves. ''Over the last five years you people were so good,'' he said. ''Over tax cuts, W.M.D. intelligence, the effect of global warming: we Americans didn't want to know, and you had the courtesy not to try and find out.''\par \par \uc2 It wasn't, in truth, Colbert's funniest hour, and it ended with a pretty lame video of Colbert, now imagining himself as White House press secretary, being stalked by an angry Helen Thomas. Many in the audience, the president in particular, seemed not to know what to make of this guy. Whose side was he on, and was he joking or not? Yet a video of the performance went viral within hours, and Stephen Colbert became something like a household name. Writing in The Times, Frank Rich said Colbert's routine that night was the ''moment when the American news business went on suicide watch.''\par \par \uc2 ''I was happy how it turned out,'' Colbert says now of that evening. ''But I had no sense that it was any special deal.'' Not until the next day did someone point out to him that a Web site called Thank You, Stephen Colbert had gone up and there were already 14,000 responses on it.\par \par \uc2 Colbert grew up in Charleston, where, for much of his life, the family lived in the George Chisolm House, a Federal-style mansion that is one of the city's many historic houses. He may have been biologically destined to be an entertainer: he was the 11th of 11 children. He says now that most of his siblings were funnier. ''My brother Billy was the joke teller,'' he told me one morning in his office upstairs in the building where ''The Colbert Report'' is taped. It looks like a dorm room, with a ''Lord of the Rings'' pinball machine at one end, an elliptical trainer at the other, a Nixon campaign poster on the wall and a desk strewn with knickknacks. ''My brother Jim had a really sharp, cutting wit. And the teller of long stories, that was my brother Ed. As a child, I just absorbed everything they said, and I was always in competition for the laughs.''\par \par \uc2 In 1974, when Colbert was 10, his father, a doctor, and his brothers Peter and Paul, the two closest to him in age, died in a plane crash while flying to a prep school in New England. ''There's a common explanation that profound sadness leads to someone's becoming a comedian, but I'm not sure that's a proven equation in my case,'' he told me. ''I'm not bitter about what happened to me as a child, and my mother was instrumental in keeping me from being so.'' He added, in a tone so humble and sincere that his character would never have used it: ''She taught me to be grateful for my life regardless of what that entailed, and that's directly related to the image of Christ on the cross and the example of sacrifice that he gave us. What she taught me is that the deliverance God offers you from pain is not no pain -- it's that the pain is actually a gift. What's the option? God doesn't really give you another choice.''\par \par \uc2 One result of his father's death is that Colbert stopped making much of an effort in school. ''Nothing seemed that important,'' he said. ''What was the cudgel over your head?'' By high school he had become dreamy and nerdy, spending all his time reading science fiction and playing Dungeons and Dragons, and his friends were all the same way. ''Socially, we were out in the hinterlands,'' he said. ''Living in the social mud huts.'' But during junior year he happened to say something that made people laugh, and pretty soon he had become the school wit. It was around that time that he started Frenchifying his name. ''I was probably still Colbert to a lot of people,'' he said, pronouncing the T, the way the rest of his family did. ''But in my mind I was coal-BARE.''\par \par \uc2 Colbert went to Hampden-Sydney College, in Virginia, one of the few places he could get in. He majored in philosophy and was miserable and depressed much of the time. ''Belated grieving is what it was, and it lasted till I got out of college,'' he said. The one thing he enjoyed was acting in plays, and eventually he told himself: ''You'd be crazy not to take that as a hint. It's the only thing you work hard at.''\par \par \uc2 With the encouragement of his mother, who had once aspired to be an actor herself, he transferred to the theater program at Northwestern. ''She said, 'I don't know why, but I'm not worried about you,' '' he said, laughing. ''I think it was foolish, irresponsible parenting.''\par \par \uc2 Chicago is to improv what Seattle once was to grunge bands, and in his years there, both in college and afterward, Colbert embraced the movement. He even studied with the strange and legendary Del Close, a reformed drug addict and a pagan who was sometimes known as the Ted Kaczynski of comedy. For Close, improv was more nearly a philosophy or a way of life than just a way of getting laughs, and Colbert embraced his ideas sufficiently that in the late 1980s, when he took a job answering the phone at Second City (the famous breeder of comic talent, practically a farm team for ''Saturday Night Live''), he briefly thought he was slumming. ''I thought, Yeah, yeah, I'll answer the phones, but I'd never want to perform here,'' he said. Even after he joined the Second City troupe, in which Amy Sedaris and Steve Carell were colleagues, what he really wanted to do, he said, was straight theater. ''I'd think to myself, I've got to do 'Hamlet,' I've got to do avant-garde theater, and so I would quit, grow a beard and do a play.''\par \par \uc2 Colbert's co-conspirator in those days was the director and playwright Dexter Bullard, who would call him up and say, ''Do you want to get in trouble?'' Getting in trouble meant hiring a hall, inviting some critics and then picking a play -- something by Havel, say, whom they had barely heard of -- and learning it and putting it on in a week or so. You could argue that ''The Colbert Report'' is just a funnier adaptation of the same principle, put together in even less time.\par \par \uc2 Colbert's first TV job was on ''Exit 57,'' a half-hour sketch-comedy show that he wrote and performed with Sedaris and Paul Dinello, which was sometimes funny and sometimes not. He later worked and appeared with Sedaris and Dinello on ''Strangers With Candy,'' a series that was a parody of earnest after-school specials. The standout on both shows was Sedaris. Colbert seems too bland in a way -- too sane and too conventionally good-looking -- to be a great comic performer. The role he was born for, an exaggerated version of himself, hadn't yet come his way.\par \par \uc2 Colbert remains enormously fond of those early shows, especially ''Strangers,'' which he likens to free-form jazz. But he said that when he began doing his location pieces for ''The Daily Show,'' the ones that evolved into ''The Colbert Report,'' he found great satisfaction in the craft of them. ''I thought of it as making these little Chinese boxes, with intricate inlay,'' he said. ''I loved that. It's like an artist known for his sculptures all made with found objects glued together with human bodily fluid, and then he'd photograph them, and the photographs would be burned and the ashes would be turned into a painting. But did you know he also made neat little wooden boxes?''\par \par \uc2 By now Colbert and his staff, which numbers about 80, have the show down to something like a science. They call it the ''joy machine,'' with equal emphasis on the fun and the mechanics, and the engine runs practically nonstop, at very high r.p.m.'s. By 11 every morning, a rough plan for that day's show is established and the writers -- all of them brainy and most in their 30s -- are sent off, usually in pairs, to come back with finished scripts in just a couple of hours. Editing and polishing goes on all day, and sometimes continues even after the taping is done, around 9 or so.\par \par \uc2 The show's writing process is extravagantly wasteful. Colbert likes to say, ''Let's make it perfect and then cut it.'' Every day enough good jokes or ideas are jettisoned to fill another couple of half-hours. Some are deemed too weak by Colbert's demanding standards, some are put on hold for want of time on a given night and are then forgotten, and some are merely left behind as the show is swept along with the relentless news cycle. ''The trade-off with the show is that you can have an idea and see it on TV that night,'' Tom Purcell, the executive producer, says. ''The downside is that you have to do it all over again tomorrow. It's a hungry beast.''\par \par \uc2 Some good Chris Christie and Tim Pawlenty material had to be dumped, for example, when Christie and Pawlenty took themselves out of the Republican presidential race. Other promising bits abandoned recently were one about a porn bunker developed by some adult filmmakers in anticipation of the Mayan doomsday prophecy; one examining the possible Nazi past of the clothing company Hugo Boss; a piece about how it's legal in 36 states for prisons to shackle pregnant inmates while they're giving birth; and a little film clip about how Americans needed a new young woman to worry about, now that Amanda Knox has been freed. Colbert suggested that perhaps one of the interns could be put in a box and attacked by bees.\par \par \uc2 In early October, when Hank Williams Jr. and his ''Monday Night Football'' song ''Are You Ready for Some Football?'' were taken off the air by ESPN after Williams compared the golf game between Barack Obama and John Boehner to Hitler playing golf with Benjamin Netanyahu, and said that Obama and Joe Biden were like two of the Three Stooges (he failed to specify which), it seemed like a godsend. One of the writers suggested that they invent some phony video of Hitler out on the links, actually swinging a golf club. Another came up with the notion of a new song: ''Are You Ready for Some Foosball?'' Colbert had a better idea. Perhaps Stephen Sondheim could be persuaded to write a song about what it was like to be alone and forlorn after football, when the game is over and your life has not changed. He even wrote Sondheim, who is a friend of the show, an e-mail that began ''Will you help me save America and football?'' Sadly, Sondheim declined.\par \par \uc2 Colbert, who is good at compartmentalization, manages in spite of this exhausting schedule to make time for his family. For some of the writers, the job is more all-consuming. One of them, Opus Moreschi, told me that he solves the problem of how to balance the job and a life by forgoing the life. ''Basically, I've never had a life except for comedy, so it isn't that much of a problem,'' he said. Yet for all the demands that Colbert puts on his staff members, he is apparently beloved by them. ''There are a lot of unhappy people in comedy,'' Purcell said, ''and sometimes you get a very radioactive vibe. But Stephen has an excellent way of treating people. You should never underestimate the power of good manners.''\par \par \uc2 Emily Lazar, a supervising producer and the show's talent booker, said: ''When the show started, Stephen was 41, 42 -- something like that -- and he was one of us. He relates to being a worker bee. He understands what our lives are like.''\par \par \uc2 Many of the show's writers also have improvisational training and once a month or so put on an improv evening at the UCB Theater in New York. A couple of them are even bold enough to channel the Colbert persona during meetings, so that there are multiple Colberts in the room, and Colbert himself isn't even one of them. For all its scriptedness, the show has a loose, try-anything quality. One of the basic rules of improv is never to say ''no,'' but always ''yes'' or ''yes -- and'' -- to take a premise and expand on it.\par \par \uc2 Colbert's super PAC is in a way an extended improvisation with no end in sight. It just keeps adding new layers. Why does he have a super PAC? Because he can and because it's funny. On most evenings the show's best moments occur when Colbert is winging it with a guest. There's the Colbert persona listening and grinning while the other Colbert, the one who is surely not an idiot, processes what the guest is saying, invents a response and then translates it back into the language of his character. The process happens faster than most of us can think. ''The trouble with the jokes,'' Colbert said to me, talking about the ones scripted beforehand, ''is that once they're written, I know how they're supposed to work, and all I can do is not hit them. I'm more comfortable improvising. If I have just two or three ideas and I know how the character feels, what the character wants, everything in between is like trapeze work.''\par \par \uc2 Lazar said: ''Stephen has all these personalities that he's learned because he watches people and has an incredible intellectual and emotional memory. They are gathered in his lower extremity and he can call them forth at will and actually become those people.''\par \par \uc2 Colbert likes to say that the whole show is a ''scene,'' a term that in improv-speak means not just a unit of dramatic time but a transaction in which one character wants something from another. The other character in this instance is us, the audience, and what Colbert wants from us is love. The one moment on ''The Colbert Report'' that is not fake is when he sits at his desk and basks while the audience chants, ''Ste-phen, Ste-phen, Ste-phen!'' He can't get enough.\par \par \uc2 The show also enables a Walter Mitty side of Colbert, which is why he says he will never get tired of it. ''As executive producer of this show, I get to ask my character to do whatever I want,'' he said. Among other things, the character has so far visited troops in Baghdad; bottled and branded his own sperm; dueled light sabers with George Lucas; sung with Barry Manilow; sung as a trio with Willie Nelson and Richard Holbrooke; appeared on the Jimmy Fallon show, along with Taylor Hicks and the Abominable Snowman, in a big production of the hit song ''Friday''; harmonized on the national anthem with Toby Keith; and danced a passage from ''The Nutcracker,'' in suit jacket, tights and codpiece, with David Hallberg.\par \par \uc2 So why wouldn't the character -- this third Colbert, performing an extended improv in the real world -- want to run for president again? The last time I spoke with Colbert, before he left for his Christmas break, I brought this up. He looked at me for a moment, and then his eyes twinkled, and he underwent the same metamorphosis he does every evening. ''I don't think you ever say 'never,' '' he said. ''That's a discussion I'll have to have with my family. I'll need to pray on it.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: January 8, 2012, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Page 20 this weekend about Stephen Colbert misspells part of the title of a segment from ''The Daily Show'' that featured him when he was a regular performer on the program. It was ''Even Stevphen,'' not Stephven. The article also misspells the surname of an actor Colbert worked with in the Second City troupe. He is Steve Carell, not Carrell.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: 5:22 p.m. Dressing for a rehearsal of ''The Colbert Report'' on Dec. 8.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Obama administration officials announced on Friday they are proposing a fix to a Catch-22 in immigration law that could spare hundreds of thousands of American citizens from prolonged separations from \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  spouses and children.\par \par \uc2 Although the regulatory tweak appears small, lawyers said it would mean that many Americans will no longer be separated for months or years from family members pursuing legal residency. Even more citizens could be encouraged to come forward to bring \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  relatives into the system, they said.\par \par \uc2 The move was greeted with unusually broad praise from immigration lawyers and immigrant and Latino groups, which have been critical of the high rate of deportations under President Obama. Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles, called it a ''welcome rational solution to a simple problem'' that will mean ''thousands upon thousands of families will remain together.''\par \par \uc2 The fix is one of a number of recent measures by the administration that do not require the approval of Congress, designed to ease the effects on immigrant communities of contradictory or outmoded statutes. White House officials have been seeking ways to shore up sagging support for the president, particularly among Latinos.\par \par \uc2 In essence, officials at Citizenship and Immigration Services are proposing to change the procedures by which illegal immigrants with American family members apply for legal residency -- getting a document known as a green card -- allowing a crucial early step to take place in the United States rather than in the immigrant's home country.\par \par \uc2 Alejandro Mayorkas, the director of the agency, said the purpose was to relieve burdens on citizens while also streamlining a convoluted, costly process.\par \par \uc2 ''We are achieving a system efficiency, saving resources for the taxpayers and reducing the time of separation between a spouse or child and the U.S. citizen relative,'' Mr. Mayorkas said.\par \par \uc2 On Friday the agency published a formal notice in The Federal Register that it was preparing a new regulation. But Mr. Mayorkas stressed that step was only the beginning of a long process the agency hopes to complete by issuing a new rule before the end of this year.\par \par \uc2 The applause from lawyers, Latinos and immigrant organizations was a strikingly different message than the administration has heard for many months.\par \par \uc2 ''This will open up a huge door to bring a large number of people into the light,'' said Charles Kuck, an immigration lawyer in Atlanta who is a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Based on their caseloads and census data, lawyers estimate that many hundreds of thousands of Americans are married to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The new rule would make no change in the situation of illegal immigrants who do not have immediate American family members. White House officials acknowledge that there will be no progress before the November elections on legislation the president supports to give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Under the law, American citizens are entitled to apply for green cards for immigrant spouses and children, even those who entered the country illegally. But the law requires most to return to their home countries to receive their visas.\par \par \uc2 The catch is that once the immigrants leave the United States, they are automatically barred from returning for at least three years and often for a decade, even if they are fully eligible to become legal residents.\par \par \uc2 Citizenship and Immigration Services can provide a waiver from those bars, if the immigrants can show that their absence would cause ''extreme hardship'' to a United States citizen. But for the past decade, obtaining the waiver was almost as difficult and time-consuming as getting the green card.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants had to return to their countries to wait while the waiver was approved. Waiting times extended to months, even years. Sometimes waivers were not approved, and immigrants were permanently separated from their American families.\par \par \uc2 The journey toward green cards for which they were eligible was so risky that many families simply decided to live in hiding and not apply.\par \par \uc2 Now Citizenship and Immigration Services proposes to allow illegal immigrants to get a provisional waiver in the United States before they leave to pick up their visas. Having the waiver in hand will allow them to depart knowing they almost certainly will be allowed to return, officials said. The agency is also seeking to cut down wait times for immigrants overseas to only a few weeks.\par \par \uc2 ''Finally -- an opportunity,'' said one American citizen in North Carolina who has been married for seven years to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Honduras. The woman said she wept Friday when she heard the news of the waiver proposal.\par \par \uc2 The couple owns a construction business and has four children who are citizens. They tried to apply for his legal documents, she said, but immigration lawyers advised them that if he left for Honduras to pick up a visa, he would be unable to return for 10 years. ''If you try to come out of the shadows, your family will suffer,'' the lawyers told her.\par \par \uc2 Now they will start his application again, said the woman, who remained reluctant to publish her name until the new rule takes effect.\par \par \uc2 ''We can't survive without each other,'' she said. ''I should have a right as a U.S. citizen to live in my country with my husband.''\par \par \uc2 Republicans criticized the move as an effort by Mr. Obama to circumvent Congress. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called it ''an abuse of administrative powers.'' Mr. Smith was an author of legislation in 1996 that created the 3- and 10-year bars to return by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Nancy Kuznetsov, a leader of American Families United, a group of Americans who are struggling in the immigration system, said many members called her Friday, elated.\par \par \uc2 ''Yay!'' said Mrs. Kuznetsov, who was separated for more than four years from her husband, Vitali, who is from Belarus, while waiting for a waiver. ''There are so many families this will be a good thing for, I feel good in my heart that this is finally happening.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020120107e8170005r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc87}{\*\bkmkend toc87}\b \uc2 Nowhere to Go, Patients Linger In Hospitals, At a High Cost\b0\par\par\uc2 By SAM ROBERTS \par \uc2 1,261 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 January 2012\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hundreds of patients have been languishing for months or even years in New York City hospitals, despite being well enough to be sent home or to nursing centers for less-expensive care, because they are illegal immigrants or lack sufficient insurance or appropriate housing.\par \par \uc2 As a result, hospitals are absorbing the bill for millions of dollars in unreimbursed expenses annually while the patients, trapped in bureaucratic limbo, are sometimes deprived of services that could be provided elsewhere at a small fraction of the cost.\par \par \uc2 ''Many of those individuals no longer need that care, but because they have no resources and many have no family here, we, unfortunately, are caring for them in a much more expensive setting than necessary based on their clinical need,'' said LaRay Brown, a senior vice president for the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation. Under state law, public hospitals are not allowed to discharge patients to shelters or to the street.\par \par \uc2 Medicaid often pays for emergency care for illegal immigrants, but not for continuing care, and many hospitals in places with large concentrations of illegal immigrants, like Texas, California and Florida, face the quandary of where to send patients well enough to leave. Officials in New York City say they have many such patients who are draining money from the health system as the cost of keeping people in acute-care hospitals continues to escalate.\par \par \uc2 But even if Medicaid pays for some care, taxpayer dollars are ultimately being consumed by patients who could be cared for in nursing homes or other health facilities, and even at home if supportive services were available. Care for a patient languishing in a hospital can cost more than $100,000 a year, while care in a nursing home can cost $20,000 or less.\par \par \uc2 Patients fit to be discharged from hospitals but having no place to go typically remain more than five years, Ms. Brown said. She estimated that there were about 300 patients in such a predicament throughout the city, most in public hospitals or higher-priced skilled public nursing homes, though a smattering were in private hospitals.\par \par \uc2 One patient, a former hospital technician from Queens, has lived at the city's Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility on Roosevelt Island for 13 years because the hospital has no place to send him, Ms. Brown said. The patient, who is in his mid-60s, has been there since an arterial disease cost him part of one leg below the knee and left him in a wheelchair. The city's public health system declined to provide the names of any long-term patients or make them available for interviews, citing confidentiality laws.\par \par \uc2 Five years ago, Yu Kang Fu, 58, who lived in Flushing, Queens, and was a cook at a Chinese restaurant in New Jersey, was dropped off by his boss at New York Downtown Hospital, a private institution in Manhattan, complaining of a severe headache. Mr. Yu was admitted to the intensive-care unit with a stroke.\par \par \uc2 Within days, he was well enough for hospital personnel to begin planning for his release, but as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  (he had overstayed a work visa a decade ago), he was ineligible for health benefits. And no nursing home or rehabilitation center would take him. Neither would his son in China nor the Chinese government, although the hospital volunteered to fly him there at its expense.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Yu's protracted hospital stay was first chronicled in an article in The New York Times in 2008 about the treatment of uninsured immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Yu remained in the hospital for over four years until he was transferred last spring to the Atlantis Rehabilitation and Residential Health Care Facility, a private center in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, after the federal government certified him as a ''permanent resident under color of law,'' essentially acknowledging that he could not be returned to China and qualifying him for medical benefits.\par \par \uc2 ''This gentleman cost us millions of dollars,'' said Jeffrey Menkes, the president of New York Downtown. ''We try to provide physical, occupational therapy, but this is an acute-care hospital. This patient shouldn't be here.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Yu said that the hospital had treated him well, but that he had made enormous progress in regaining his ability to walk through his rehabilitation regimen at Atlantis. He hopes to return to China when he is well enough to be discharged.\par \par \uc2 ''Here, I am very happy,'' he said. ''This is very nice -- No. 1.''\par \par \uc2 New York Downtown serves a largely immigrant population, and many patients have no insurance or proof that they are in the United States legally, which is necessary for discharge purposes and eventual reimbursements, said Chui Man Lai, assistant vice president of patient services at the hospital.\par \par \uc2 ''These patients often arrive in the emergency room acutely ill and unaccompanied, and we have to treat them until they can be discharged safely,'' Ms. Lai said. ''The hospital is required, by law and its mission, to care for these patients.''\par \par \uc2 Health professionals refer to them as ''permanent patients,'' trussed in red tape and essentially living in hospitals already operating on thin margins. In some cases, health care professionals say, grown children leave ailing parents at the hospitals and go on vacation. Officials call that practice a ''pop drop.''\par \par \uc2 Though the problem is particularly severe in the municipal hospital system, longtime patients place a financial burden wherever they end up.\par \par \uc2 New York Downtown spends about $2 million annually for such patients out of an operating budget of about $200 million. An acute-care patient can cost the hospital more than $1,500 a day.\par \par \uc2 Hospitals are reluctant to complain publicly about such patients for fear of being perceived as callously seeking to dump nonpaying patients. Elected officials are generally loath to be seen as encouraging illegal immigrants by changing reimbursement formulas. The issue was never addressed during the debate over national health care legislation.\par \par \uc2 Longtime patients, meanwhile, risk getting sicker because they are exposed to diseases that fester in hospitals.\par \par \uc2 ''At times there is a fine line regarding who meets the criteria to be admitted to a hospital, but if there's no way to immediately contact a family member and the patient needs nonmedical help or is homeless, you're obligated to provide shelter,'' said Dr. Warren B. Licht, who recently retired as New York Downtown's chief medical officer after seven years to return to full-time clinical practice in the wellness and prevention center that he founded there. ''You can't kick a patient out of the hospital.''\par \par \uc2 New York Downtown, Dr. Licht said, has offered to pay for nursing home care for patents who are uninsured and are illegal immigrants, but care facilities are reluctant to risk taking patients for fear that they would be saddled with unexpected and unreimbursed expenses.\par \par \uc2 ''If the patient does not have or cannot obtain health insurance to pay for the next level of care, other non-acute-care health facilities won't routinely accept a patient,'' Dr. Licht said.\par \par \uc2 New York Downtown has four or five patients out of a total of 180 who have no place to go, he said, adding, ''It cost us several million dollars a year in a hospital struggling to keep its head above water.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Yu Kang Fu was moved to a care center in Brooklyn last spring after spending over four years at New York Downtown Hospital.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA -- A federal judge on Thursday blocked the most controversial parts of South Carolina's new immigration law from taking effect next month.\par \par \uc2 The decision, by Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court in Charleston, S.C., sets the stage for a legal showdown on immigration as the United States Supreme Court prepares to hear a challenge to a similar law in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Judge Gergel blocked the most contentious part of South Carolina's law, which requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of any suspect they believe may be in the country illegally. He also banned provisions that make it a crime to harbor or transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 South Carolina's Republican-controlled State Legislature passed the law in June, and it would have taken effect on Jan. 1. Federal judges have now struck down portions of state immigration laws in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana and Utah.\par \par \uc2 ''This is one more decision in favor of blocking these laws,'' said Andre Segura, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project. ''It further highlights that the weight of authority is that these laws are unconstitutional.''\par \par \uc2 This month, the Supreme Court announced that it would decide whether Arizona was entitled to impose its tough anti-immigration law, a ruling that could dictate the constitutionality of laws in South Carolina and other states. In a sense, legal experts say, these lower court battles are merely prologues to that decision.\par \par \uc2 ''This is all really just a way station on the way to the Supreme Court's ruling in the Arizona case,'' said Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University who specializes in immigration. ''The South Carolina ruling is important in the short term in putting the law on hold. But the Supreme Court will have the final say.''\par \par \uc2 Not all rulings have favored immigrants' rights groups. In Alabama, a federal judge upheld the majority of the state law. But in Georgia and Arizona, courts have struck down the most far-reaching provisions.\par \par \uc2 The South Carolina law was challenged by the Justice Department and a coalition of civil rights groups that included the A.C.L.U. and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Both challenges argued that the federal government had the constitutional authority to regulate immigration, not the states.\par \par \uc2 South Carolina, echoing a position that Arizona took when it passed its immigration law in April 2010, argued that the federal government had ceded that authority by failing to prevent an influx of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ''If the feds were doing their job, we wouldn't have had to address illegal immigration reform at the state level,'' Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for South Carolina's governor, Nikki R. Haley, said in a statement on Thursday. ''But, until they do, we're going to keep fighting in South Carolina to be able to enforce our laws.''\par \par \uc2 Governor Haley, a Republican, championed the immigration law, and she now hopes the Supreme Court ''will soon do what Congress and the executive branch have failed to do, which is allow the states to pick up the slack where Washington has failed,'' Mr. Godfrey said.\par \par \uc2 In his ruling, Judge Gergel noted the ''traditionally predominant role of the federal government in the field of immigration.'' He struck down provisions that make it a state crime for anyone to knowingly harbor or transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He also ruled against a provision that requires immigrants to carry federal registration documents. He did, however, uphold a portion of the law that requires illegal immigrants to be transferred from state to federal custody.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Marchers protested in front of Federal District Court in Charleston, S.C., on Monday against the state's new immigration law.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc89}{\*\bkmkend toc89}\b \uc2 For Illegal Resident, Line Is Drawn at Transplant\b0\par\par\uc2 By NINA BERNSTEIN   \par \uc2 1,554 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 December 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Without treatment to replace his failing kidneys, doctors knew, the man in Bellevue hospital would die. He was a waiter in his early 30s, a husband and father of two, so well liked at the Manhattan restaurant where he had worked for a decade that everyone from the customers to the dishwasher was donating money to help his family.\par \par \uc2 He was also an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . So when his younger brother volunteered to donate a kidney to restore him to normal life, they encountered a health care paradox: the government would pay for a lifetime of dialysis, costing $75,000 a year, but not for the $100,000 transplant that would make it unnecessary.\par \par \uc2 For nearly two years, the brothers and their supporters have been hunting for a way to make the transplant happen. Their journey has taken them through a maze of conflicting laws, private insurance conundrums and ethical quandaries, back to the national impasse between health care and immigration policies.\par \par \uc2 The waiter's boss sought private insurance, she and the brothers said, speaking on the condition that their names be withheld for fear of provoking immigration authorities. The Catch-22: for the first year, the waiter, called Angel, would get no coverage for his ''pre-existing condition,'' nor would he receive the dialysis that keeps him alive and able to work four days a week.\par \par \uc2 Doctors sought a transplant center that would take him. Hospitals in the city receive millions of taxpayer dollars to help offset care for illegal immigrants and other uninsured patients. But at one hospital, administrators apparently overruled surgeons willing to waive their fees. At another, Angel was told to come back when he had legal status or $200,000.\par \par \uc2 A last resort is a return to Mexico, where the operation costs about $40,000. But to pay off the necessary loans, Angel and his brother, a deli worker, would have to sneak back in through the desert. If they failed, they would be cut off from their children in Brooklyn, who are United States citizens.\par \par \uc2 ''As a physician, it puts you in a real ethical dilemma,'' said Dr. Eric Manheimer, Bellevue's medical director, noting that a transplant would sharply reduce Angel's risk of death from complications. ''The ultimate irony is it's cheaper to put in a transplant than to dialyze someone for the rest of their life.''\par \par \uc2 Bellevue performs no transplants but, as a trauma center, often supplies organs harvested, with family consent, from illegal immigrants fatally injured at work.\par \par \uc2 ''Here's the paradox: he could donate, but he can't receive,'' Dr. Manheimer said, calling the imbalance troubling. Organ registries do not record illegal status, but a study estimated that over a 20-year period noncitizens donated 2.5 percent of organs and received fewer than 1 percent.\par \par \uc2 To those focusing on immigration enforcement, however, the inequity runs the other way. ''They should not get any benefit from breaking the law, especially something as expensive as organ transplants or dialysis,'' said Representative Dana T. Rohrabacher, Republican of California, who contends that care for illegal immigrants is bankrupting American health care and has sought to require that emergency rooms report stabilized patients for deportation unless they prove citizenship or legal residence.\par \par \uc2 ''If they're dead, I don't have an objection to their organs being used,'' Mr. Rohrabacher added. ''If they're alive, they shouldn't be here no matter what.''\par \par \uc2 To Ruth Faden, the director of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, the brothers' case, like the transplant statistics, illustrates how quickly firm principles on both sides unravel in practice.\par \par \uc2 ''We tie ourselves up in knots,'' she said, ''because we've accepted as a country and in international human rights law that if someone shows up in extremis in your emergency room, the nurses and doctors and technicians are morally obligated, and legally obligated, to provide that life-saving care.''\par \par \uc2 How to begin refusing care, she added, becomes a dilemma for ''real people in real time.''\par \par \uc2 The sudden onset of the waiter's illness in January 2010 left no time to spare. At Bellevue, he underwent surgery to implant a temporary venous catheter in his neck, to cleanse his blood of lethal toxins. The cause of his renal disease is most likely genetic: when he was 8 -- about the age of his own sons now -- his father died of kidney failure.\par \par \uc2 Through quirks of legislative history, nearly everyone with end-stage renal disease in the United States, regardless of income, is covered under federal Medicare for dialysis and transplantation, except illegal immigrants. But regardless of a patient's immigration status, hospitals can be reimbursed for emergency care by Medicaid, the federal and state insurance program for the needy.\par \par \uc2 Unlike most states, New York, California and North Carolina define outpatient dialysis as an emergency measure. Studies show such regular dialysis is cheaper, with fewer life-threatening complications, than waiting until toxin levels require hospital treatment.\par \par \uc2 ''What do I have to do to become normal?'' Angel remembers asking. The medical answer was clear: a transplant, and anti-rejection drugs costing about $10,000 a year. But news that his brother and sister were compatible donors came with a blunt warning, the waiter recalled: ''As long as you don't have your papers, you won't get a transplant.''\par \par \uc2 Like many Mexican New Yorkers, Angel has relatives who migrated years ago without visas and are now citizens. An uncle still works for the restaurateur who helped him legalize. But immigration rules have changed, eliminating such paths.\par \par \uc2 ''My boss, she tried to help me,'' said the waiter, who supported his mother and half-siblings from the age of 16, and worked his way up from busboy, paying taxes, mastering English and learning enough French to counsel diners on the wine list. ''We find no way.''\par \par \uc2 His boss kept hunting. ''He deserves every break he can get,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 They consulted lawyers at LegalHealth, which counsels low-income patients. Randye Retkin, the director, said the waiter was one of a dozen patients in need of transplants who were referred to the nonprofit program by hospitals last year because of immigration barriers.\par \par \uc2 For many there is no remedy, Ms. Retkin said. She cited a Mexican mother of two who died without the small-bowel transplant she needed, just as lawyers won a yearlong legal battle for Medicaid to pay for it.\par \par \uc2 The waiter turned to the Mexican consulate, which appealed to Dr. Manheimer. The doctor said he persuaded surgeons at NYU Langone Medical Center to waive their $20,000 fees, but administrators would not absorb the rest. The hospital declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Two other doctors, Hector J. Castro, a critical care specialist, and Kann H. Patel, a hematologist, sent Angel to Mount Sinai Medical Center. But there a financial transplant counselor told him he would have to pay double the typical cost in advance, to cover any complications.\par \par \uc2 ''Personally, I'm troubled by it,'' said Dr. Sander Florman, who directs the Recanati/Miller Transplantation Institute at Mount Sinai. ''We're looking at human beings.''\par \par \uc2 But Dr. Florman confirmed that the waiter's experience reflected policies at the hospital. ''Our general approach is we're not the immigration police,'' he said. ''On the other hand, there has to be a mechanism to pay for it.''\par \par \uc2 Mount Sinai officials say they provided $67.3 million in uncompensated care last year, and received $25 million from the state to offset such costs. ''Mount Sinai struggles each day to balance its limited resources with its strong commitment to provide compassionate medical care,'' it said in a statement, noting that kidney transplantation, unlike dialysis, is not an emergency procedure under Medicaid.\par \par \uc2 For nearly everyone else, however, there is a Medicare option. Scholars trace the unusual program, now costing $40 billion a year, to a 1962 Life magazine article titled ''They Decide Who Lives, Who Dies,'' about laymen at a Seattle hospital who judged which patients would get scarce treatment on the first ''artificial kidney machine.'' The outcry that followed is often credited for the birth of bioethics and for the 1972 law guaranteeing coverage.\par \par \uc2 That law did not mention citizenship, said Dr. Scott Sanoff, who teaches medicine at the University of Virginia, but later restrictions, and murky state-by-state variations in Medicaid, left decisions on illegal immigrants' access to care to each medical center, often without any payment mechanism. The life-and-death nature of the decisions has been obscured, he added: In the case of Angel, ''his life expectancy could be more than doubled with the transplant compared to dialysis.''\par \par \uc2 The waiter now shuttles between a basement dialysis center, the restaurant and his family's cramped but well-kept walk-up. There, as their children clustered nearby, his brother, 26, said they would not give up.\par \par \uc2 ''He's more than my brother, he's like my father,'' he said. ''If I can give him life, I have to.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, called Angel, left, with his younger brother, who volunteered to donate a kidney to Angel.; Angel undergoing dialysis treatment.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A growing number of United States citizens have been detained under Obama administration programs intended to detect illegal immigrants who are arrested by local police.\par \par \uc2 In a spate of recent cases across the country, American citizens have been confined in local jails after federal immigration agents, acting on flawed information from Department of Homeland Security databases, instructed the police to hold them for investigation and possible deportation.\par \par \uc2 Americans said their vehement protests that they were citizens went unheard by local police and jailers for days, with no communication with federal immigration agents to clarify the situation. Any case where an American is held, even briefly, for immigration investigation is a potential wrongful arrest because immigration agents lack legal authority to detain citizens.\par \par \uc2 ''I told every officer I was in front of that I'm an American citizen, and they didn't believe me,'' said Antonio Montejano, who was arrested on a shoplifting charge last month and found himself held on an immigration order for two nights in a police station in Santa Monica, Calif., and two more nights in a teeming Los Angeles county jail cell, on suspicion he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Mr. Montejano was born in Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 This year the immigration agency has been rapidly extending its leading deportation program, known as Secure Communities, with a goal of covering the whole country by 2013. Under that program, fingerprints of every person booked at local jails are checked against Department of Homeland Security immigration databases. If the check results in a match, federal immigration agents can issue detainers, asking local law enforcement authorities to hold a suspect for up to 48 hours.\par \par \uc2 Detentions of citizens are part of the widening impact on Americans, as well as on immigrants, of President Obama's enforcement strategies, which have led to more than 1.1 million deportations since the beginning of his term, the highest numbers in six decades.\par \par \uc2 John Morton, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the agency gave ''immediate and close attention'' to anyone who claimed to be a citizen.\par \par \uc2 ''We don't have the power to detain citizens,'' Mr. Morton said in an interview on Tuesday. ''We obviously take any allegation that someone is a citizen very seriously.''\par \par \uc2 Later this month, Mr. Morton said, the immigration agency will publish new forms for its detainers. The forms, in several languages, will require the police to notify suspects who are being held on federal immigration authority, he said. They will also provide a hot line where detainees can call the immigration agency directly.\par \par \uc2 Exact numbers of Americans erroneously held by immigration authorities are hard to come by, since they are not systematically recorded. In one study, 82 people who were held for deportation from 2006 to 2008 at two immigration detention centers in Arizona, for periods as long as a year, were freed after immigration judges determined that they were American citizens.\par \par \uc2 ''Because of the scale of enforcement, the numbers of people who are interacting with Immigration and Customs Enforcement are just enormous right now,'' said Jacqueline Stevens, the study's author and a political science professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Stevens has concluded that ''a low but persistent'' percentage of the nearly 400,000 people held for deportation each year are citizens.\par \par \uc2 One was Mr. Montejano, when a holiday shopping outing on Nov. 5 to a Los Angeles mall with his four children ended badly. After his young daughter begged for a $10 bottle of cologne, Mr. Montejano said, he inadvertently dropped it into a bag of things he had already bought. As he left the store, he was arrested.\par \par \uc2 With no prior criminal record, Mr. Montejano, 40, expected to post bond quickly at the Santa Monica police station on the misdemeanor charge and go home. He had his driver's license and other legal identification, but because of an immigration detainer he was denied bail and held even after a criminal court judge canceled his fine and ordered the police to let him go.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Montejano was freed on Nov. 9 after American Civil Liberties Union lawyers sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement his United States passport and birth certificate.\par \par \uc2 ''Just because I made one mistake,'' Mr. Montejano said, ''I don't think they should have done all those things to me.''\par \par \uc2 He said he thought the police did not believe he was an American because of his appearance. ''I look Mexican one hundred percent,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Montejano had triggered a positive match in the Homeland Security Department databases, A.C.L.U. lawyers discovered, because immigration officials had failed once before to recognize his citizenship, mistakenly deporting him to Mexico in 1996. His records were not corrected.\par \par \uc2 An American college student, Romy Campos, was also trapped in a California jail last month for four days on an immigration detainer. After her Nov. 12 arrest in Torrance on a minor misdemeanor charge, Ms. Campos, 19, was denied bail and transferred to a Los Angeles County jail. A public defender assigned to her in state court said there was nothing he could do to lift a federal detainer.\par \par \uc2 ''Can't they see in my file or something that I'm a citizen?'' Ms. Campos said she asked him. ''He said: 'I'm sorry, but this is state court. I can't do anything about it.' ''\par \par \uc2 After four days, Ms. Campos was released, soon after Jennie Pasquarella, an A.C.L.U. lawyer, provided her Florida birth certificate to the immigration agency.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Campos said the experience was shocking. ''I felt misused completely, I felt nonimportant, I just felt violated by my own country,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Campos, a citizen of both the United States and Spain, later learned that she had a Department of Homeland Security record because she had once entered the United States on her Spanish passport.\par \par \uc2 United States citizens can also be tagged in a Secure Communities fingerprint check because of flukes in the department's databases. Unlike the federal criminal databases administered by the F.B.I., homeland security records include all immigration transactions, not just violations. An immigrant who has always maintained legal status, including those who naturalized to become American citizens, can still trigger a fingerprint match.\par \par \uc2 According to Margaret Stock, an immigration lawyer in Alaska, under the nation's complex citizenship laws, many foreign-born people become Americans automatically, through American parents or adoption. Often their citizenship is not recorded in homeland security databases, Ms. Stock said.\par \par \uc2 Other cases of possibly illegal detentions of citizens have been recently reported in Allentown, Pa., Indianapolis and Chicago.\par \par \uc2 I.C.E. agents generally cancel detainers immediately when they determine the suspect is a citizen. In no recent cases was an American placed in deportation.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Stevens cautioned: ''It's sort of like the canary in the mine. If those who have the full due process rights of U.S. citizens are being detained, it tells us a lot about potentially unlawful people who do not have those protections.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: An American college student, Romy Campos, was sent to a California jail on an immigration detainer.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- In the space of a month, the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  has thrust itself into the center of American political life, agreeing to hear three major cases that could help determine which party controls the House of Representatives and whether President Obama wins a second term.\par \par \uc2 The court announced Monday that it would decide whether Arizona was entitled to impose tough anti-immigration measures over the Obama administration's objections. The case joined a crowded docket that already included challenges to Mr. Obama's signature legislative achievement, the 2010 health care overhaul law, and a momentous case on how Texas will conduct its elections.\par \par \uc2 The Texas case, which on Friday the court agreed to hear, could cause as many as four seats in the United States House of Representatives to change party control.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not just that these are big cases, but these are big cases that echo in the political arena,'' said Nathaniel Persily, a professor of law and political science at Columbia University. ''There is now a judicial forum for airing these political disputes.''\par \par \uc2 Arizona enacted its immigration law last year, and the Obama administration promptly sued to block four parts of it, saying they could not be reconciled with federal laws and policies.\par \par \uc2 The challenged provisions include a requirement that state law enforcement officials determine the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest if officials have reason to believe that the individual might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . That provision also requires that the immigration status of people who are arrested be determined before they are released.\par \par \uc2 The law also makes it a crime under state law for immigrants to fail to register under a federal law and for illegal immigrants to work or to try find work. In addition, it allows the police to arrest people without warrants if they have probable cause to believe that they have done things that would make them deportable under federal law.\par \par \uc2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, blocked all four provisions.\par \par \uc2 Applauding the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's decision to review that ruling, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, was harshly critical of the administration.\par \par \uc2 ''I was stunned at the audacity of the Obama administration to file suit against an individual state seeking to safeguard its people,'' Ms. Brewer said in a statement. ''That shock turned to outrage as the federal government proceeded to file suit against three more states -- South Carolina, Alabama and now Utah -- that followed Arizona's lead.''\par \par \uc2 The health care and immigration decisions are likely to land in June, in the heat of the presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 The court must act much faster in the Texas case, where its decision on Friday to stay the use of a set of election maps, created by federal judges, has thrown election planning there into disarray. Political observers believe that the new maps would increase the influence of Hispanic voters and thereby increase the number of Democrats in the House.\par \par \uc2 The court's precedents point both ways in the health care case, and it is hard to say what the outcome will be. In the Arizona and Texas cases, recent decisions suggest that a majority of justices may look favorably on the positions of state officials, which would entail upholding the Arizona immigration law and rejecting at least a part of the court-drawn maps in Texas.\par \par \uc2 In May, the court upheld a different Arizona law, one that imposed harsh penalties on businesses that employed illegal immigrants. In a 2009 decision, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, expressed skepticism about the continuing vitality of a part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that the court in Texas relied on in substituting its own maps for ones drawn by the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Legal scholars and court historians struggled to think of another recent \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  term in a presidential election year with a similar pileup of cases with sharp political and societal consequences. The political impact of the term's rulings may, moreover, be amplified by the court's decision last year in Citizens United, which unleashed unlimited campaign spending by corporations and unions.\par \par \uc2 Some experts pointed to 1992, which featured a major abortion ruling and other big decisions. But the current term may be most reminiscent of the showdown between the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  and President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, when the court struck down major pieces of New Deal legislation as well as a New York law establishing a minimum wage for women and children.\par \par \uc2 ''There was a whole series of blockbuster cases, each with massive political implications and economic consequences for the country,'' said Jeff Shesol, the author of ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 .'' That description sounds rather like the current term.\par \par \uc2 There is a great deal of happenstance in the shaping of a \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  docket, and the fact that several cases arrived at the court at once does not necessarily suggest an agenda. The last term was lackluster; this one is lively.\par \par \uc2 ''In most of these cases, it's a coincidence of timing,'' said Justin Driver, a law professor at the University of Texas.\par \par \uc2 The justices had little choice, for instance, in agreeing to hear a challenge to the health care law, as federal appeals courts were divided over its constitutionality and the Obama administration joined its opponents in urging the court to act quickly. But the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  did not have to signal that the case was a once-in-a-generation blockbuster by scheduling an extraordinary five and half hours of arguments.\par \par \uc2 The court had more options in deciding how to act on a request from officials in Texas in the redistricting dispute. The court could have stayed out of the matter, effectively endorsing the maps that favored Democrats, which were drawn by a special three-judge court in San Antonio that ignored a separate set of maps drawn by the Republican-dominated Legislature.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  could have sent the case back to the special court, directing it to give more deference to the Legislature's maps. Or the justices could have jumped in feet first. They took the boldest route.\par \par \uc2 It was, similarly, not a sure thing that the justices would accept the Arizona case, which was one of several cases in the federal pipeline involving tough state anti-immigration laws. Lower courts had not issued a final ruling on the Arizona law, giving the justices plausible reasons to wait. Instead, they chose to weigh in on one of the most combustible issues in American politics.\par \par \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  decisions routinely have political consequences, of course, sometimes quite direct ones. In 2000, 11 years to the day before the court agreed to hear the Arizona case, the court effectively decided a presidential election, in Bush v. Gore.\par \par \uc2 Putting that case to one side (as the court has, never citing it), court watchers have to go back two decades, at least, to think of \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  terms as politically consequential as the current one.\par \par \uc2 Eric J. Segall, a law professor at Georgia State University, pointed to the term that ended in June 1992, which included major cases raising fundamental issues of abortion, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and school desegregation. The most important of those decisions was Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which reaffirmed the core of the right to abortion established by Roe v. Wade.\par \par \uc2 In the new crop of cases, too, the court may yet avoid creating political earthquakes.\par \par \uc2 ''I would not be surprised at all if they are looking at Solomonic ways to avoid trouble in an election year,'' Barry Friedman, a law professor at New York University, said of the justices.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: A demonstration in Phoenix in May 2010 against Arizona's strict immigration law, which the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  will consider.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MISSION, Tex. -- On the last night of his life, Joaquin Luna Jr., 18, filled the pages of a spiral notebook with goodbyes. In brief letters to relatives, friends and teachers, he asked one of his brothers to take care of his nephews and his niece and told a friend he had left a memento for her in his Bible.\par \par \uc2 One letter was different from the rest. It was addressed to Jesus Christ, and in it he asked for forgiveness. ''Jesus,'' he wrote, ''I've realized that I have no chance in becoming a civil engineer the way I've always dreamed of here ... so I'm planning on going to you and helping you construct the new temple in heaven.''\par \par \uc2 In the days since Mr. Luna took his own life last month and since some of his writings became public, his story -- of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who suddenly lost hope of becoming the first in his family to go to college -- has evolved into something more.\par \par \uc2 To the immigrant rights movement in Texas, Mr. Luna has become a symbol of the psychological toll that being in the country illegally can take on young people. To others, he has become a political pawn, with his death being used by those who support the passage of the Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who go to college.\par \par \uc2 Still others have questioned what role, if any, Mr. Luna's immigration status played in his suicide. Although his relatives claimed that he committed suicide because of the pressure he felt, none of the letters mentioned his illegal status. In his letter to Jesus, he suggested that another issue was troubling him, saying he was ''fearful to fall in any temptation,'' though he did not elaborate.\par \par \uc2 But beyond the reasons for his death, Mr. Luna's suicide has had an impact far past the border towns of the Rio Grande Valley. It has given other illegal immigrants in high school and college the courage to speak out about their own depression.\par \par \uc2 It has also thrust a low-income family of immigrants into the national spotlight and put a troubled teenager's final letters at the center of the immigration debate, with relatives, activists, politicians and reporters dissecting them seeking evidence for or against the family's claims.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Luna was a shy, lanky young man who played guitar in church bands and helped care for his diabetic mother near the border in Hidalgo County, one of the poorest counties in America, where 35.2 percent of the population lived below the poverty level in 2009. His neighborhood is a rural, ragged place, with run-down trailer homes and graffiti-tagged street signs. The skyline is dominated not by tall buildings but by windswept palm trees that tower over dirt yards, stray dogs and citrus groves.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Luna, who was born in Reynosa, Mexico, and came to the United States as an infant, was not like most teenagers in Mission. He drew the blueprints that were used to build his mother's new house and spoke often of becoming either an architect or a civil engineer. He joked that he did not have time for a girlfriend, spending many weekends mowing lawns to pay for his electric guitar and lessons. At Benito Juarez-Abraham Lincoln High School, he was ranked 89th out of 467 students in the senior class.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, administrators at the school and several people close to Mr. Luna said he had given no indication that anything was wrong. But on Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving, he put on a maroon shirt and a tie, lay down next to his mother and told her he was sorry he was never going to be the person he wanted to be, relatives said. Then he went into the bathroom, put a handgun underneath his chin and pulled the trigger.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Luna's family told local reporters that he had killed himself because of the despair he felt over his immigration status as he was applying to colleges and that he had been affected by the Senate's failure to pass the Dream Act last year. At that point, relatives had not read Mr. Luna's letters because the Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office had confiscated them as part of its investigation.\par \par \uc2 The story was quickly seized on by supporters of the Dream Act. College students in Austin painted posters reading ''I am Joaquin.'' At a vigil honoring Mr. Luna in Los Angeles, mourners listened to a message recorded by his relatives. In Washington, a Texas congressman, Representative Ruben Hinojosa, a Democrat from Edinburg, spoke of Mr. Luna on the floor of the House and urged Congress to pass the Dream Act.\par \par \uc2 Guadalupe Trevino, the Hidalgo County sheriff, said that Mr. Luna's death had been ruled a suicide, but that investigators had not established a motive.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm very disappointed that some folks, and even some of our elected leaders, have exploited and politicized this young man's ill decision to take his own life, especially when we have found no evidence that points to any particular motive,'' Sheriff Trevino said. ''Nobody knows why he did it. Only he knows for sure why he did what he did.''\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's office provided the letters to the family on Dec. 2. Relatives said that even though the letters failed to mention the issue, they continue to believe that Mr. Luna committed suicide because of his immigration status, based on their conversations with him and the references in the letters to his failure to realize his dreams.\par \par \uc2 ''We lived with him, so we know, and it doesn't matter what other people say,'' said one of Mr. Luna's brothers, Diyer Mendoza, 35, a truck driver who has become the family spokesman. ''Every time he would put in an application, the first thing that would pop up was 'Are you a U.S. citizen?' No. 'Resident?' No. 'Social Security number?' No. It was all just mounting and mounting on top of him. I truly believe that if that Dream Act would have already passed, he would still be here today.''\par \par \uc2 As it became clear that the letters mentioned neither immigration nor the Dream Act, immigrant rights advocates went on the defensive as their conservative opponents attacked their handling of the issue. On its Web site, Americans for Legal Immigration said the claims about Mr. Luna's suicide had been ''proven as a hoax by desperate and unscrupulous \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  invasion supporters.''\par \par \uc2 The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, which organized the vigil there, issued a statement saying it believed that the family was not being dishonest and was not exaggerating.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. Hinojosa said he stood by his remarks because of statements the family made to his staff. ''The congressman has no reason to doubt what the family has said,'' said the spokeswoman, Patricia Guillermo.\par \par \uc2 Greisa Martinez, a senior at Texas A&M University and the coordinator of the Texas Dream Alliance, said the contents of Mr. Luna's letters had not reduced the effect his suicide had on students who are in the country illegally. ''We can all share in that pain and that angst that he felt at that moment, because we've all been there,'' said Ms. Martinez, 23, who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One of the colleges Mr. Luna applied to was the University of Texas-Pan American, in nearby Edinburg. For a school project, he wrote that he wanted to attend the university because it was close to home and inexpensive. Mr. Luna was accepted, but he never found out: he died before his admission became official.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Joaquin Luna Jr. came to the United States as an infant.

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 What does the term ''anchor baby'' mean? If you were to look it up in the American Heritage Dictionary, you would find a new definition since last week.\par \par \uc2 The term was among some 10,000 new words and phrases in the fifth edition of the dictionary, published in November. It was defined as: ''A child born to a noncitizen mother in a country that grants automatic citizenship to children born on its soil, especially such a child born to parents seeking to secure eventual citizenship for themselves and often other members of their family.''\par \par \uc2 But when Steve Kleinedler, the executive editor of the dictionary, read that definition during a radio interview last month, it troubled Mary Giovagnoli, the director of the Immigration Policy Center, a pro-immigration research group in Washington.\par \par \uc2 The once-obscure term has been used frequently in the recent debate over whether to change the Constitution to deny automatic American citizenship to children born in this country to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents.\par \par \uc2 Last Friday morning, Ms. Giovagnoli posted an angry item on the center's blog, saying the dictionary ''masks the poisonous and derogatory nature of the term, a term which demeans both parent and child.'' Her item soared into the blogosphere. By Friday afternoon, Mr. Kleinedler had called Ms. Giovagnoli.\par \par \uc2 His editors huddled over the weekend, and on Monday a new definition of ''anchor baby'' was posted on the dictionary's Web site. It started with ''offensive,'' in italics: ''Used as a disparaging term for a child born to a noncitizen mother in a country that grants automatic citizenship to children born on its soil, especially when the child's birthplace is thought to have been chosen in order to improve the mother's or other relatives' chances of securing eventual citizenship.''\par \par \uc2 In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Kleinedler said the dictionary had rectified an error. ''The term is now treated similarly to how the dictionary treats a wide range of slurs,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020111209e7c900073\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Campaign rhetoric to the contrary, statistics show that the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border is less of a problem now than it has been for four decades.\par \par \uc2 While presidential candidates talk about how to secure the United States-Mexico border, data show that their focus might instead be on dealing in a positive way with the millions of illegal immigrants already here. Apprehensions by the United States Border Patrol are at their lowest level since the Nixon era, according to unofficial statistics from the agency that The Washington Post reported this month.\par \par \uc2 A sour economy, increased enforcement by the Border Patrol and skyrocketing smuggling fees are keeping more would-be crossers at home.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, the Border Patrol apprehended about 448,000 illegal immigrants on the Southwest border, roughly 93,000 fewer than in 2009. This year, apprehensions have dipped by more than 25 percent, to 327,500.\par \par \uc2 There are now 10.2 million \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  adults in the country and another 1 million illegal minors, according to data released this month by the Pew Hispanic Center. The center estimates that 35 percent of those adults have been in the country 15 years or longer, compared with 16 percent in 2000. Conversely, only 15 percent have been in the country five years or less, compared with 32 percent in 2000.\par \par \uc2 ''It's more expensive to get in, it's more dangerous to get in and there are no jobs to be had,'' said Jeffrey S. Passel, the senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center. ''It's not surprising that the inflows are way down.''\par \par \uc2 James W. Ziglar, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute and a commissioner of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service under President George W. Bush, said there are so many people in the country illegally because the system has long been dysfunctional.\par \par \uc2 ''We are not going to deport these people,'' Mr. Ziglar said. ''We need to deal with the problem and provide them with a way to a legal status.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ziglar's stance reflects the view of many of his fellow Republicans. In a poll this year, the Pew Research Center for People and the Press found that 58 percent of so-called Main Street Republicans supported a path to legalization while 39 percent opposed it. A poll by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a bipartisan group of mayors and business leaders, found that only 16 percent of likely attendees at the Iowa Republican caucuses were opposed to expanding legal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Along some parts of the Texas-Mexico border, violence is also down. Ciudad Juarez, for example, is on pace for 1,000 fewer homicides this year -- a rare bit of good news in a ravaged city. Howard Campbell, a professor of anthropology at the University of Texas at El Paso, said the violence in adjacent Ciudad Juarez has subsided because the gangs used by the Juarez drug cartel are weaker and the Sinaloa cartel -- which has waged a war in the city since 2008 -- is distracted with tougher battles to the west. Mr. Campbell also cited pressure on President Felipe Calderon to make the police and the military more accountable and to improve his country's image.\par \par \uc2 ''In general,'' Mr. Campbell said, ''things hit bottom, and so there is an almost natural cycle of improvement. Whether this improvement will last is impossible to say.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: A fence along the Rio Grande in Brownsville and a sign are meant to deter illegal crossers.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Two years ago, a community of Indonesians in central New Jersey was spared deportation after a Protestant pastor brokered an unusual agreement with immigration authorities that allowed them to stay in the country temporarily. The agreement was clear: The Indonesians would be able to stay and work, but the permission could be rescinded at any moment.\par \par \uc2 The 72 Indonesians and their supporters, led by the Rev. Seth Kaper-Dale, had appealed for the arrangement in the hope that with extra time, they would be able to figure out a way to secure permanent legal status, either though the courts or with the passage of immigration reform legislation in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates had hoped the deal signaled a broader use of humanitarian release for illegal immigrants without criminal records and with deep ties to the community.\par \par \uc2 Now, though, the reprieve for the Indonesians is ending.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, most of the Indonesians, many of whom fled persecution of Christians in Indonesia years ago, have received letters from the Department of Homeland Security ordering them to appear at the agency's Newark office, a one-way ticket to Indonesia in hand.\par \par \uc2 Their advocates have leapt into action, appealing to immigration officials for continued lenience and lobbying members of the state's Legislature and Congressional delegation to intervene.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney of New York and Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, both Democrats, plan to submit a bill that would provide relief to many of the Indonesians. The bill would allow certain Indonesians who fled persecution in their homeland between 1997 and 2002 to resubmit asylum claims that had been denied because they missed a one-year filing deadline.\par \par \uc2 ''It feels so un-American to not make room to keep families together, especially when folks came out of a time and place where there was tremendous violence,'' Mr. Kaper-Dale said in a telephone interview on Tuesday as he led a 24-hour vigil and fast at his parish, the Reformed Church of Highland Park, N.J., in support of the Indonesians.\par \par \uc2 The advocates said the decision to end the so-called orders of supervision was surprising in light of recent assurances by the Obama administration that it would focus its enforcement strategy on illegal immigrants with criminal records, while sparing those with strong ties to the community and no criminal record.\par \par \uc2 In June, senior officials at the Homeland Security Department announced a policy to encourage immigration agents and lawyers to use prosecutorial discretion when deciding whether to pursue deportation. The policy expanded the factors immigration authorities can take into account in such decisions, including how long an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has been in the United States and whether the immigrant was brought to the country as a child. In addition, the directive gave federal immigration lawyers the authority to dismiss deportation proceedings against immigrants without serious criminal records.\par \par \uc2 Last month, Homeland Security officials, seeking to speed deportation of convicted criminals, said they would begin a review of all deportation cases in the immigration courts and begin training enforcement agents and government lawyers in the application of the new prosecutorial discretion guidelines.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaper-Dale said all the Indonesians he had been helping would seem to be worthy candidates for this sort of relief. Most have been in the country for at least a decade and have American-born children, steady jobs and no criminal records, he said.\par \par \uc2 Most of the Indonesians have filed requests for prosecutorial discretion, he said. ''If these folks were good enough for discretion two years ago, why aren't they good enough for discretion now?'' the pastor asked.\par \par \uc2 Officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an arm of Homeland Security, would not explain on Tuesday why the orders of supervision were ending now. In response to media inquiries, an agency spokesman issued a statement saying that the agency was reviewing appeals ''on a case-by-case basis.''\par \par \uc2 The orders of supervision allowed ''individuals to remain in the community -- as opposed to in detention -- while they pursue legitimate forms of immigration relief,'' the statement said.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, however, 12 of the Indonesians, responding to an immigration agency order, appeared at the Newark office. They ignored demands that they bring plane tickets, Mr. Kaper-Dale said. Agency officials told them to return later this month and added that the agency would issue them plane tickets, the pastor said.\par \par \uc2 Among them was Grace Laloan, 42, who arrived in the United States in 2002 with her husband. She said the couple, both Christians of Chinese descent, had fled religious and ethnic persecution by the Muslim majority. They have an American-born daughter, now 7, and work in factories, Ms. Laloan said.\par \par \uc2 Officials told her they would inform her of her fate on Dec. 21. ''I don't know, maybe they're going to send me back,'' Ms. Laloan said. ''It feels bad because I want to stay here.''\par \par \uc2 Under the terms of the bill proposed by Representatives Maloney and Pallone, an applicant must be an Indonesian citizen; must have entered the United States after Jan. 1, 1997, and before Nov. 30, 2002; must have had an asylum application rejected because of a late filing; and must not have a criminal record or be otherwise barred from receiving asylum, among other conditions.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaper-Dale said more than 1,000 Indonesians might be affected by the bill, including clusters in New York and New Hampshire for whom he helped secure orders of supervision in 2010.\par \par \uc2 ''It is our hope through a pending Congressional action, I.C.E. will stay deportation proceedings,'' Representative Maloney said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Jacob Senewe, 9, of Edison, N.J., and his mother, Audrey Sondakh, at a vigil for Indonesians on Monday in Highland Park, N.J.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The state attorney general, Luther Strange, is recommending that the Legislature repeal the parts of Alabama's tough new immigration law that have been put on hold by federal courts and clarify some others. In a letter to legislative leaders, Mr. Strange recommended repealing a section that makes it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to fail to carry registration documents. He also suggested repealing the requirement that public schools collect information on the immigration status of students. Mr. Strange said the proposed changes would help law enforcement and remove burdens on law-abiding citizens. He also recommended repealing sections allowing lawsuits to compel public officials to enforce the law. He said that conflicts with the Alabama Constitution. The letter represents the first time the attorney general, a Republican, has expressed concerns since he started defending the law against a federal court challenge filed by about 30 organizations and individuals.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020111207e7c700062\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc97}{\*\bkmkend toc97}\b \uc2 Gingrich's Words on Immigration Become a Target\b0\par\par\uc2 By JEFF ZELENY and TRIP GABRIEL; Jeff Zeleny reported from Des Moines, and Trip Gabriel from New York.   \par \uc2 1,220 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 November 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 24\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DES MOINES -- An intense debate over immigration flared among the Republican presidential candidates on Wednesday as Mitt Romney declared that Newt Gingrich ''offered a new doorway to amnesty'' when he called for a ''humane'' immigration policy to avoid deportation for people who are deeply rooted in their churches and communities.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romney, who is eager to stop the rise of Mr. Gingrich with the Iowa caucuses only six weeks away, signaled that he intended to go after his rival with the same vigor he used against Gov. Rick Perry of Texas two months ago when he said Republicans were ''heartless'' for standing in the way of offering education to children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 With the controversy likely to shape the next phase of the nominating fight, Mr. Romney repeatedly used the word ''amnesty'' during a campaign visit here to describe the position Mr. Gingrich outlined at a debate Tuesday night. While aides to Mr. Gingrich forcefully refuted the characterization of his plan as ''amnesty,'' a swift backlash erupted among conservative activists that could present the biggest test of his resurgent candidacy.\par \par \uc2 Representative Steve King of Iowa, a leading voice against illegal immigration, said he was puzzled that Mr. Gingrich had suddenly injected such a red-hot issue into his campaign. He said it was difficult to overstate how potent of a problem it could be for Mr. Gingrich, saying it set off ''a viral discussion among activists.''\par \par \uc2 ''When you have a campaign that's ascending and you make a statement like that, it's like you're backing off on the throttle and diminishing yourself,'' Mr. King said in an interview. ''It's the same philosophy as the Dream Act. How many politicians have seen their campaigns end because of that?''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Gingrich stood his ground and fired back at Mr. Romney in a message on Twitter, saying, ''So what's your position on citizenship for illegals again?''\par \par \uc2 His retort was a reference to a 2007 interview when Mr. Romney spoke favorably of creating a path toward citizenship for many of the 12 million people living here illegally. Asked about that on Wednesday, Mr. Romney said that there was no discrepancy and added that he does not favor a ''special deal'' for anyone.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich's advisers said that he did not misspeak at the debate and pointed out that his comments were in line with decades of positioning on the subject, including his support for the 1986 immigration overhaul signed by President Ronald Reagan that extended amnesty to about three million illegal immigrants. And he backed a less extensive overhaul in the 1990s as House speaker.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich, who takes Spanish classes and has started a bilingual Web site, The Americano, was not offering a new position. But his long-held view was suddenly receiving scrutiny because he has emerged as a leading candidate for the nomination.\par \par \uc2 But the strategy -- sensible as it seems during a general election with independents to be courted -- faces far different prospects in a Republican primary season, particularly in Iowa and other early-voting, conservative states.\par \par \uc2 ''Iowa caucusgoers want a solution that does not include amnesty, and if they can paint Newt with an amnesty brush it will be toxic for his campaign,'' said Tim Albrecht, a top aide to Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Gingrich said he supported securing the border and proposed creating an anti-fraud application system for immigrants, his plan to deal with those who entered the country illegally drew fresh notice. He suggested turning cases over to local citizens boards that could weigh whether residents could be allowed stay in the country.\par \par \uc2 ''If you've been here 25 years, and you got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, you belong to a local church,'' Mr. Gingrich said, ''I don't think we're going to separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully and kick you out.''\par \par \uc2 His comments touched off a torrent of criticism. Still, he took a reprieve from campaigning on the day before Thanksgiving, a sign that he was not worried.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Romney, who is intensifying his efforts to win the Iowa caucuses, raised several questions about the plan put forward by Mr. Gingrich. He said Mr. Gingrich did not draw a distinction between someone who had been here for 25 years or had arrived illegally only recently.\par \par \uc2 ''How about someone who has been here 20 years? How about 12 years? How about 10? Five? Three?'' Mr. Romney said. ''The real issue is, are we going to spend our time talking about how extensive we have amnesty?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich's spokesman, R. C. Hammond, pushed back against Mr. Romney, who also has vulnerabilities of his own on immigration. ''It isn't hard to figure out what Mitt Romney is shoveling,'' Mr. Hammond said. ''The facts show Newt's plan is the opposite of amnesty.''\par \par \uc2 Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota pressed a similar line of attack in television interviews and in a statement from her campaign titled ''Newt Gingrich's Open Door to \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Amnesty.'' While she and other rivals have limited resources to spend on advertising campaigns, Mr. Romney has showed a willingness to play aggressively.\par \par \uc2 To respond to Mr. Perry's support for a Texas law allowing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, Mr. Romney sent sharply worded fliers across Iowa and organized teleconferences for voters with Sheriff Paul Babeu of Pinal County, Ariz., who has criticized Mr. Perry's opposition to building a fence along the Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 While aides to Mr. Gingrich said that he would be able to explain his position, several Republican activists in Iowa said it could be an uphill battle.\par \par \uc2 ''Some of the candidates will treat it like it's an amnesty-type issue, which is a buzzword -- a very negative word to a lot of conservatives,'' said Mark Lundberg, chairman of the Republican Party of Sioux County, one of the state's most Republican regions.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich does not have an active campaign organization here, which complicated efforts to respond to criticism. His supporters pointed voters to his Web site, where a 10-point plan on immigration policy has been posted for some time.\par \par \uc2 He said security at the borders took priority, followed by a ''path to legality,'' which stops short of citizenship with the right to vote. He proposes that illegal immigrants who have lived for years in the United States could remain, if they show a proficiency in English and buy health insurance. They would be approved by local citizens committees -- ''something like a World War II Selective Service board.''\par \par \uc2 Dr. Greg Ganske, a former congressman and a co-chairman of the Gingrich campaign in Iowa, said he did not think the issue would be damaging.\par \par \uc2 ''The fact he spoke honestly about this and wasn't willing to pander or just give a stock answer,'' he said, ''I think a lot of people in Iowa will see that as a positive.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS\par \par \uc2 CHART: Where the Candidates Stand on Immigration: A heated discussion on immigration took place during Tuesday night's Republican presidential debate.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020111124e7bo0006x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A new Obama administration policy to avoid deportations of illegal immigrants who are not criminals has been applied very unevenly across the country and has led to vast confusion both in immigrant communities and among agents charged with carrying it out.\par \par \uc2 Since June, when the policy was unveiled, frustrated lawyers and advocates have seen a steady march of deportations of immigrants with no criminal record and with extensive roots in the United States, who seemed to fit the administration's profile of those who should be allowed to remain.\par \par \uc2 But at the same time, in other cases, immigrants on the brink of expulsion saw their deportations halted at the last minute, sometimes after public protests. In some instances, immigration prosecutors acted, with no prodding from advocates, to abandon deportations of immigrants with strong ties to this country whose only violation was their illegal status.\par \par \uc2 For President Obama, the political stakes in the new policy are high. White House officials have concluded that there is no chance before next year's presidential election to pass the immigration overhaul that Mr. Obama supports, which would include paths to legal status for illegal immigrants. But immigration authorities have sustained a fast pace of deportations, removing nearly 400,000 foreigners in each of the last three years. With Latino communities taking the brunt of those deportations, Latino voters are increasingly disappointed with Mr. Obama. White House officials hope the new policy will ease some of the pressure on Latinos, by steering enforcement toward gang members and convicts and away from students, soldiers and families of American citizens.\par \par \uc2 In a June 17 memorandum, John Morton, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, laid out more than two dozen factors that its agents and lawyers should weigh when deciding whether to exercise prosecutorial discretion to dismiss a deportation. The memo called for ''particular care and consideration'' for veterans and active-duty troops, elderly immigrants and minors, and those brought here illegally as children. In August, the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, announced additional measures to put Mr. Morton's guidelines into effect, including a review of all deportation cases -- about 300,000 --currently in the immigration courts, with the aim of closing cases that do not meet the administration's priorities.\par \par \uc2 In a report released Wednesday, the American Immigration Lawyers Association and the American Immigration Council collected 252 cases from lawyers across the country who had asked Mr. Morton's agency, known as ICE, to exercise prosecutorial discretion to spare immigrants from deportation. ''The overwhelming conclusion is that most ICE offices have not changed their practices since the issuance of these new directives,'' the report found.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a classic example of leadership saying one thing and the rank and file doing another,'' said Gregory Chen, director of advocacy for the lawyers association. The report found that training for immigration officers on the new guidelines had been lacking. Officials at the Homeland Security Department acknowledge the policy's slow start. Mr. Morton's June guidelines were followed by a three-month lull, when resistance grew among agents in the field. In late September, Ms. Napolitano and Mr. Morton went on the offensive to press the policy, and since then Mr. Morton has been on the road inaugurating training programs.\par \par \uc2 ''Like any major change in enforcement policy, this is a work in progress,'' Mr. Morton said by telephone from Miami, where he was joining in a training session. ''I have been handling much of the initial explanation myself, because I feel so strongly about it.''\par \par \uc2 Officials say they need time to transform federal agencies accustomed to cut-and-dried immigration enforcement, with any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a target for deportation. Ms. Napolitano says immigration agents must become more like other police officers, using ''sound prosecutorial practice'' to follow priorities. Those priorities are to deport convicted criminals, serial violators of immigration law and recent border crossers, officials said.\par \par \uc2 The priorities did not apply for Neida Lavayen, 46, an American citizen in Elizabeth, N.J. After a three-year courtship, she had planned on Sept. 23 to marry Ruben Quinteros, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Uruguay. Mr. Quinteros, 43, had come legally to the United States, then stayed past his time limit. But once he and Ms. Lavayen married, he would be eligible for a permanent resident's green card as the spouse of a citizen.\par \par \uc2 Eight days before the wedding, Mr. Quinteros was arrested by immigration agents. His lawyer, Heather Benno, argued that he should benefit from prosecutorial discretion, since he was days away from resolving his immigration status. He had no criminal record, had paid taxes and had provided vital support for his fiancee, who suffered domestic abuse in her first marriage.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Benno's motions were denied. Ms. Lavayen found a pastor to marry the couple in the detention center, but immigration agents declined to release Mr. Quinteros for a few hours so he could go with Ms. Lavayen to get the marriage license, since registrars would not issue one without him. They were not able to marry, and Mr. Quinteros was deported Oct. 27.\par \par \uc2 ''I never thought I would fall in love again and have dreams again and live such a beautiful romance,'' Ms. Lavayen said in a telephone conversation, pausing often to cry. ''How did my country take away my happiness?''\par \par \uc2 By contrast, a student from Germany received good news that he had not asked for. Manuel Bartsch, now 24, was brought to the United States when he was 10 years old, then remained without documents. He stuck to his studies and is now nearing graduation from a private university in Ohio. After a legal fight in 2006, the immigration agency suspended Mr. Bartsch's deportation, said his lawyer, David Leopold. On Nov. 3, the agency surprised Mr. Bartsch by terminating his deportation case entirely.\par \par \uc2 Like others whose deportations are canceled under the new policy, Mr. Bartsch will remain in limbo without any positive immigration status, Mr. Leopold said. But he will be able to apply for a work permit, an identity document that can open many doors.\par \par \uc2 ''Hats off to ICE in the field for following the directives,'' Mr. Leopold said.\par \par \uc2 Outspoken resistance to the policy has come from Chris Crane, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees' union local that represents ICE deportation agents. In testimony last month before the immigration subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Crane said that Mr. Morton's guidelines were too complex and ''cannot be effectively applied in the field.''\par \par \uc2 Rather than adding flexibility, Mr. Crane said, the guidelines ''take away officers' discretion and establish a system that mandates that the nation's most fundamental immigration laws are not enforced.''\par \par \uc2 Still, uncertainty about the policy among agents appeared more widespread than outright rejection did. That was the experience of Shamir Ali, a 24-year-old student born in Bangladesh, who was detained Oct. 19 when the police raided a Miami car rental agency where he worked, looking for someone else. Mr. Ali seemed to fit within the discretion guidelines: he had no criminal record and had been brought by his parents to the United States when he was 7. But immigration agents denied his first requests to be spared from deportation.\par \par \uc2 Then student groups staged protests on Mr. Ali's behalf in eight cities. On Oct. 28, agents freed Mr. Ali on an order of supervision, also allowing him to apply for a work permit. For Mr. Ali, like Mr. Bartsch, that permit would be life-changing, since it would allow him to obtain a driver's license and to enroll at resident rates in a state college.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ali said he felt deeply grateful to the immigration agency. But he wondered: ''If I didn't have all that support, what would have happened to me?''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Shamir Ali, 24, faced deportation but was later freed under a new administration policy.

SEELYE; Marc Lacey reported from Mesa, and Katharine Q. Seelye from New York. Salvador Rodriguez contributed reporting from Phoenix.   \par \uc2 1,246 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 November 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MESA, Ariz. -- For years, Russell Pearce, Arizona's most powerful legislator and the architect of its tough immigration law, has sought to make life so uncomfortable for illegal immigrants in the state that they pack up and go.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Pearce, known for his gruff, uncompromising manner, was the one sent packing on Tuesday after disgruntled voters in this suburban neighborhood outside Phoenix banded together to recall him from the State Senate and replace him with a more moderate Republican.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm grateful for the battles that we've won,'' said Mr. Pearce as election results showed his opponent, the first-time candidate Jerry Lewis, ousting him from office late Tuesday night. ''If being recalled is the price for keeping one's promises, then so be it.''\par \par \uc2 Latino advocates saw Mr. Pearce's defeat, 53 percent to 45 percent, with some ballots still to be tallied, as a sign that Republican politicians like Mr. Pearce were pushing too far with their get-tough approach to illegal immigration and that there were consequences if they did not get in sync with voter concerns.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a game-changer for Arizona, politically speaking,'' said Representative Raul Grijalva, Democrat of Tucson. ''He's been the author of so much of what's been going on in this state. He's used race and division to get elected, and now he's gone.''\par \par \uc2 Some of his Republican colleagues, though, predicted that Mr. Pearce, given his hard-charging ways and the backing of the Tea Party movement, would find a way to return to politics -- and that there were plenty of others, from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County to Gov. Jan Brewer, who would press immigration in his absence.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm not going to stop,'' said Mr. Arpaio, who is known for his immigration raids and who was commiserating with Mr. Pearce, a longtime ally, on Tuesday night. ''I'm going to do more.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pearce had been a sheriff's deputy for 23 years before his election to the State Legislature in 2000, and his recent unpopularity was partly a result of his brusque demeanor, which resembled that of an annoyed beat cop during a traffic stop. But voters in east Mesa, a conservative, blue-collar district, also complained that he was consumed with one issue above all else.\par \par \uc2 One of his sons, a sheriff's deputy at the time, was shot by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and Mr. Pearce argued that the state was being overrun by outlaws without papers. He was behind a 2004 ballot measure that required proof of legal residency for those receiving state services or voting. He championed a 2007 law that allowed the state to take the business licenses of firms that hired illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But he became best known for his 2010 law, known as Senate Bill 1070, that would have, if a federal judge had not intervened, turned police officers throughout the state into de facto immigration agents. Despite fierce controversy, the law was popular in Arizona and beyond, and gave rise to copycat legislation in other states, including an even more stringent version in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 ''We are in the front of the parade,'' Mr. Pearce is fond of saying.\par \par \uc2 It was Mr. Pearce's follow-up to the 2010 law that got him in trouble. This year, he drafted a proposal to compel medical personnel to question patients about their immigration status and school officials to do the same with students. He also championed stripping the citizenship of children born in the Arizona to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's business community, stung by boycotts of the state after passage of the 2010 law, rose up against Mr. Pearce. Some of his Republican colleagues withheld their support, which Mr. Pearce considered betrayal. He also saw some of his initiatives vetoed by Ms. Brewer, who had her differences with Mr. Pearce, especially given his comments that it was her support for his proposals that propelled her to victory last November.\par \par \uc2 ''He engaged in a bullying type of politics,'' said Randy Parraz, a Democrat who founded Citizens for a Better Arizona, the group that organized the campaign against Mr. Pearce.\par \par \uc2 During the campaign, backers of Mr. Pearce helped a Mexican immigrant, Olivia Cortes, put her name on the ballot to siphon votes away from Mr. Lewis, but the tactic appeared to backfire.\par \par \uc2 Many of those who supported the ouster of Mr. Pearce had been his supporters in past elections.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm a sort of redneck conservative, but for me he just went way too far on immigration,'' said Tyler Montague, who like Mr. Pearce and Mr. Lewis is a member of Mesa's influential Mormon Church. ''I agree that we can't have everyone from the third world coming here, but it began to feel like he hated these people, and I don't. They go to our churches. I know some of them.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lewis, a charter school executive who is fluent in Spanish, said he would be more amenable to compromise, on immigration and everything else, than the man he is replacing.\par \par \uc2 ''What this says is that people, wherever they are, want their politicians to be responsive to them and listen to them and react when they say, 'You may be going too far,' '' Mr. Lewis said.\par \par \uc2 Despite tossing Mr. Pearce out of office, voters elsewhere showed little inclination to get rid of incumbents. Several big-city mayors were re-elected, even though most cities have been especially burdened by the sour economy.\par \par \uc2 In Houston, Mayor Annise Parker overcame low approval ratings and anti-gay attacks to hold on to office, but just barely. Ms. Parker, a lesbian, won with about 51 percent of the vote against five challengers. Mayors in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Indianapolis coasted to re-election.\par \par \uc2 In San Francisco, Edwin M. Lee, the interim mayor, became the city's first elected Chinese-American mayor, according to unofficial results Wednesday. The city is one-quarter ethnic Chinese and has the country's oldest Chinatown.\par \par \uc2 In Iowa, Republicans failed to win control of the State Senate.\par \par \uc2 In Virginia, the Republican drive to take over that state's Senate -- and thereby take complete control of the state government -- was teetering on the brink. In one district, the Republican candidate held an edge of just 86 votes, which will almost certainly lead to a recount that could take weeks. If the Republican wins, control of the Senate will be split in a 20-20 tie with Democrats.

The ID card will be free, but critics say the measure is still onerous because it will likely require voters to produce a birth certificate and Social Security card to obtain the new card.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Russell Pearce, far left, was recalled from the State Senate on Tuesday, losing to another Republican, Jerry Lewis, above.
