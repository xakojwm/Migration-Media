All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Victorina Morales was one of many undocumented workers at \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  golf properties who came forward. She was placed in removal proceedings this week. A judge will decide on her bid for asylum.\par \par \uc2 An undocumented immigrant who worked for years at President Trump's luxury golf resort in New Jersey and later revealed that he employed many immigrants who are in the country illegally has been placed in deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 Victorina Morales, 47, worked for more than five years as a housekeeper at the club in Bedminster, N.J., using counterfeit identification that she said her supervisors knew to be falsified. Her revelations, first disclosed by The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  in December 2018, prompted undocumented workers at several Trump properties to come forward.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of others were fired in ensuing months by the \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2 , which owns and operates golf resorts in several states, after the company began investigating employee records.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales, a Guatemalan immigrant, was notified by the federal authorities this week that she had been placed in removal proceedings that could result in deportation. She can remain in the country only if an immigration judge approves her petition for asylum.\par \par \uc2 In a letter reviewed by The Times, \uc2 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2  said that the agency had not approved her initial application for asylum because she had not proved that ''extraordinary circumstances'' had prevented her from making an asylum claim within a year of arriving in the country, as required.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales, who witnessed her father being murdered, crossed the border illegally in 1999. She filed the asylum application jointly with her husband late in 2018, and the latest decision applied to both of them.\par \par \uc2 The immigration agency emphasized that it was not denying her asylum application but was instead referring her case to the immigration courts for removal proceedings, where a judge will review her asylum status.\par \par \uc2 Because of the backlog in immigration cases, Ms. Morales almost certainly will be allowed to remain in the United States for several years while her case is under review. She was not available for an interview on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Anibal Romero\uc2 , her lawyer, said that the agency's ruling this week ''is a serious legal matter, and my concern right now is for the safety and well-being of my client.'' He said that he would have no other comment.\par \par \uc2 After Ms. Morales arrived in New Jersey, she worked at warehouses packing consumer goods, such as soap and baby diapers. She was hired at the Trump property in 2013.\par \par \uc2 During her time at the golf resort, she said, she often cleaned Mr. Trump's personal quarters and had several personal interactions with him. She said he had praised her for her meticulous cleaning and work ethic, at times dispensing large tips to her.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Morales said that she had been hurt by Mr. Trump's disparaging public comments after he took office about Latin American immigrants, equating them with violent criminals.\par \par \uc2 It was that, she said, along with what she said were abusive remarks from a supervisor at work about her intelligence and her immigration status, that made her decide that she could no longer keep silent.\par \par \uc2 ''We are tired of the abuse, the insults, the way he talks about us when he knows that we are here helping him make money,'' she said at the time.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales was trained by Sandra Diaz, a native of Costa Rica who is now a legal resident of the United States. Ms. Diaz also came forward admitting that she had been in the country without legal permission while employed at Bedminster.\par \par \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  executives have said that they had no way of knowing that the workers had presented false employment documents, and Mr. Trump has said that he was also unaware that his properties had hired undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 During the presidential campaign, when the Trump International Hotel opened in Washington, Mr. Trump boasted that he used an electronic employment system, E-Verify, to check that only those legally authorized to work there had been hired.\par \par \uc2 ''We didn't have one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  on the job,'' Trump said then.\par \par \uc2 But throughout his campaign and after he became president, Ms. Morales had been reporting for work at his golf course. A fellow employee drove her and other undocumented workers to the resort each day, she said, because it was known that they could not legally obtain driver's licenses.\par \par \uc2 After coming forward, Ms. Morales shot to fame. In February last year, she was among 20 immigrants, many of them facing possible deportation, on the list of those seated in the secure gallery for the annual State of the Union address. In December, she visited Las Vegas and received a hug from \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 ., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. At a campaign event, she brandished a copy of a certificate of service that she had received from the White House Communications Agency.\par \par \uc2 After applying for asylum, Ms. Morales received a work permit, which enabled her to secure a housekeeping job as a legal worker at a hotel in Manhattan. She lost that job because of the coronavirus pandemic.\par \par \uc2 Among nearly 50 undocumented workers identified as having worked at Trump properties since Ms. Morales's revelations, none are known to have been deported.\par \par \uc2 Victorina Morales, an undocumented worker, sometimes cleaned President Trump's quarters at his Bedminster, N.J., club.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ''Sitting in Limbo,'' a \uc2 BBC\uc2  drama, is inspired by one story from the ''Windrush generation,'' the British residents of Caribbean heritage who were mistakenly identified as illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ''They don't believe a word I say. They decided I'm a liar. They want me to be a liar.''\par \par \uc2 Midway through ''Sitting in Limbo,'' a recent feature-length drama from the \uc2 BBC\uc2 , Anthony Bryan (Patrick Robinson) articulates a fury with the \uc2 British government\uc2  shared by many Caribbean-born Britons over the last eight years.\par \par \uc2 Written by Mr. Bryan's half brother, Stephen S. Thompson, the 90-minute drama offers an intimate and fictionalized account of how a 2012 government policy with the stated aim of creating ''a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants'' in Britain upended Mr. Bryan's life, as well as the lives of thousands of other legal residents of the country, in what became known as the Windrush scandal.\par \par \uc2 ''I'd like it to concentrate people's mind on the fact that the Windrush scandal is ongoing,'' Mr. Thompson said in a recent phone interview. ''Despite a number of documentaries and books and articles, it being a national scandal, it was in danger of fading off the scene completely,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 In ''Sitting in Limbo,'' we meet Mr. Bryan in 2016, at which point he had been living in Britain for 50 years, a grandfather working as a painter and decorator in Edmonton, North London. We see him suddenly labeled an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , unable to get work, and arrested. The cost of applying for a passport almost tips him into destitution, as he and his partner are forced to move and face the looming threat of deportation to Jamaica, a country Mr. Bryan left at the age of 8.\par \par \uc2 This is the very human cost of the decision by the future prime minister \uc2 Theresa May\uc2 , when she was the cabinet minister responsible for immigration rules, to impose tough new requirements for people not born in Britain to prove their legal status. The policy left thousands of U.K. residents from former British colonies in the Caribbean mistakenly classified as being in Britain illegally.\par \par \uc2 In 1948, a passenger liner called ''Empire Windrush'' carried some of the thousands of colonial subjects who had been invited to rebuild Britain following World War II. They became known as the ''Windrush generation'' and under the law at the time had an automatic right to settle. Many children arrived on their parents' passports. The government did not keep track of those arriving from the Caribbean, and in 2010, landing cards recording arrivals were destroyed. As a result, come the 2010s, thousands of people were unable to provide paperwork to prove they were in the country legally under Mrs. May's new rules.\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 Twitter\uc2  last week, \uc2 Priti Patel\uc2 , the current holder of Mrs. May's old post as home secretary, said the drama ''epitomizes the unimaginable suffering endured by the Windrush generation'' and apologized. An hour before the film's release, Ms. Patel invited Mr. Bryan to join a video call, \uc2 The Guardian\uc2  reported, which he declined.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Thompson, this is all lip service. Last week, Britain's human rights watchdog said it would assess the hostile environment policy, but none of the measures that led to the Windrush scandal have been revoked. Many people are still awaiting compensation from the government's \u163\'00\'A3200 million hardship fund. Some have received little compensation for years of being unable to work, and others have since died.\par \par \uc2 For Glenda Caesar, 58, watching ''Sitting in Limbo'' revived traumatic memories of her own experiences over the last few years. ''His mental breakdown was them coming and knocking the door,'' she said in a phone interview, referring to Mr. Bryan. ''But mine was more of a depressive mode, trying to accumulate paperwork that I couldn't find, which the government had destroyed.''\par \par \uc2 Having arrived in Britain as a three-month-old child from Dominica in 1961, Ms. Caesar fought for the right to remain in the country for years as she faced unemployment and mounting debt after being classified as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Filming of ''Sitting in Limbo'' began late last year, and the release was then delayed by the global coronavirus pandemic. But in many ways, Mr. Thompson said, the timing couldn't be better, given that in the last month Black Lives Matter protests have sprung up across the world following the killing of George Floyd.\par \par \uc2 For decades, the legacy of Britain's empire has created fault lines across race and economic class. These tensions have revealed themselves in the racial abuse hurled at Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, by British tabloids, and, more recently, in the toppling of a statue of a slave trader by Black Lives Matter protesters.\par \par \uc2 In ''Sitting in Limbo,'' Mr. Bryan is forced to gather the paper trails of his life. As his story evolves, we see him motivated by a desire for belonging and for some validation of his dual identity. In the drama's final act, when he shows his new British passport to his partner, Janet McKay-Williams (Nadine Marshall), she can only muster a single sigh.\par \par \uc2 ''If you'd asked me how I felt whilst we were making the film,'' Mr. Thompson said, when asked what it meant to be a black man in Britain, ''I would have said 'At least I live in a country which allows me the opportunity to tell this story and reach a wide audience.'''\par \par \uc2 But now, he's reassessing. The public's response to the film on social media and in his inbox -- praise, but also outrage at the continuing scandal and Britain's structural racism -- has given him more to think about, he said: ''As a writer, but also as a black Briton, where do I go from here? What stories do I want to tell next?''\par \par \uc2 Above, Patrick Robinson as Anthony Bryan in ''Sitting in Limbo.'' From far left, Stephen S.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Several people have been killed as unrest spreads to new corners of the country. Many see the passage of a new law as anti-Muslim.\par \par \uc2 NEW DELHI -- Prime Minister \uc2 Narendra Modi\uc2 's government has rounded up thousands of Muslims in Kashmir, revoked the area's autonomy and enforced a citizenship test in northeastern India that left nearly two million people potentially stateless, many of them Muslim.\par \par \uc2 But it was Mr. Modi's gamble to pass a sweeping new citizenship law that favors every South Asian faith other than Islam that has set off days of widespread protests.\par \par \uc2 The law, which easily passed both houses of Parliament last week, is the most overt sign, opponents say, that Mr. Modi intends to turn India into a Hindu-centric state that would leave the country's 200 million Muslims at a calculated disadvantage.\par \par \uc2 Indian Muslims, who have watched anxiously as Mr. Modi's government has pursued a Hindu nationalist program, have finally erupted in anger. Over the past few days, protests have broken in cities across the country.\par \par \uc2 Mumbai. Chennai. Varanasi. Guwahati. Hyderabad. Bhopal. Patna. Pondicherry. The disturbances keep spreading, and on Monday they tied up several areas of the capital, New Delhi.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Modi's government has responded by calling out troops, shutting down the internet and imposing curfews, just as it did when it clamped down on Kashmir. In New Delhi, police officers beat unarmed students with wooden poles, dragging them away and sending scores to the hospital. In Assam, they shot and killed several young men.\par \par \uc2 India's Muslims had stayed relatively quiet during the other recent setbacks, keenly aware of the electoral logic that has pushed them to the margins. India is about 80 percent Hindu, and 14 percent Muslim, and Mr. Modi and his party won a crushing election victory in May and handily control the Parliament.\par \par \uc2 But Indian Muslims are feeling increasingly desperate, and so are progressives, many Indians of other faiths, and those who see a secular government as fundamental to India's identity and its future.\par \par \uc2 The world is now weighing in, too. United Nations officials, American representatives, international advocacy groups and religious organizations have issued scathing statements saying that the citizenship law is blatantly discriminatory. Some are even calling for sanctions.\par \par \uc2 Critics are deeply worried that Mr. Modi is trying to wrench India away from its secular, democratic roots and turn this nation of 1.3 billion people into a religious state, a homeland for Hindus.\par \par \uc2 ''They want a theocratic state,'' said B.N. Srikrishna, a former judge on India's Supreme Court. ''This is pushing the country to the brink, to the brink of chaos.''\par \par \uc2 ''This is how waves of communal violence start in the country,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Modi is no stranger to communal violence. The worst bloodshed that India has seen in recent years exploded on his watch, in 2002, in Gujarat, when he was the top official in the state and clashes between Hindus and Muslims killed more than 1,000 people -- most of them Muslims.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Modi was widely blamed for not doing enough to stop it. Courts have cleared him, but many people believe he was at least partly responsible for the brutality that unfolded.\par \par \uc2 His grip on power is still firm, even with a weakening economy. The political opposition, including the once-dominant Indian National Congress party, has been disorganized and shaky compared with the juggernaut he and his right-hand man, Amit Shah, the home minister, have built in their Bharatiya Janata Party.\par \par \uc2 But this contentious citizenship law, which paves a special path for non-Muslim migrants in India to become citizens, has galvanized the opposition. Rival opposition leaders who usually can't agree on anything are planning protests together. Students from across the country are rallying to each other's defense. Each episode of harsh police action captured by mobile phone and beamed around cyberspace catalyzes more sympathy, more protests -- and more prospects for violence.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Mr. Modi called for calm, saying on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that the law ''does not affect any citizen of India of any religion'' and ''the need of the hour is for all of us to work together.''\par \par \uc2 This citizenship law was a much touted campaign promise and a special wish of his Hindu base. His supporters see a future India as a place that emphasizes its Hindu heritage as much as possible and eliminates the special legal protections that exist for Muslims and other minorities.\par \par \uc2 Some analysts are quick to point out that the course Mr. Modi's party is charting could lead to an India dominated by one faith and one viewpoint, where existential tensions hold back the economy and hamstring politics -- as embodied by Pakistan, India's struggling, Islamic archenemy next door.\par \par \uc2 "We're chasing a failed dream,'' said \uc2 Yogendra Yadav\uc2 , a political commentator.\par \par \uc2 The new citizenship legislation, called the Citizenship Amendment Act, expedites Indian citizenship for migrants from some of India's neighboring countries if they are Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Sikh, Parsee or Jain. Only one major religion in South Asia was left off: Islam.\par \par \uc2 Indian officials have denied any anti-Muslim bias and said the measure was intended purely to help persecuted minorities migrating from India's predominantly Muslim neighbors -- Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.\par \par \uc2 The legislation follows hand in hand with a divisive citizenship test conducted this summer in one state in northern India and possibly soon to be expanded nationwide.\par \par \uc2 All residents of Assam, along the Bangladesh border, had to produce documentary proof that they or their ancestors lived in India since 1971. Around two million of Assam's population of 33 million -- a mix of Hindus and Muslims -- failed to pass the test and now risk being rendered stateless. Huge new prisons are being built to house anyone determined to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A widespread belief is that the Indian government will use both these measures -- the citizenship tests and the new citizenship law -- to strip away rights from Muslims who have been living in India for generations. The way this will happen, many Muslim Indians fear, is that they will be asked to produce old birth certificates or property deeds necessary to prove citizenship and they will be unable to do so. And while Hindu residents in the same situation will be given a pass, it seems, Muslim residents will not have the same legal protections.\par \par \uc2 The protests started last week in Assam, led by Hindus and joined by Assamese Muslims and Christians. Many Hindus in Assam don't like the new law either: They fear it could open the floodgates to poor migrants who will settle in Assam and take their land. And so, despite the legislation's potential to drive a sectarian wedge across India, in Assam it backfired, unifying protesters across religious lines.\par \par \uc2 Witnesses said that security forces fired live ammunition into a crowd, killing a 17-year-old Christian student as he walked home. Outraged demonstrators then burned down train stations and attacked the police.\par \par \uc2 Struggling to maintain control, the central government sent in the army and shut down the internet. The angry crowds only grew.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, the protests spread to Delhi. Students of Jamia Millia Islamia University, a predominantly Muslim institution, gathered peacefully, witnesses said. But chaos broke out after a separate group of violent protesters joined the fray and began clashing with the police, witnesses said.\par \par \uc2 The police response was swift and indiscriminate, according to witnesses, and videos widely circulated on social media showed officers beating students. In one video, a group of female students tries to rescue a young man from the grasp of the police. A squad of officers in riot gear tears him away and knocks him down with heavy blows. Even after the women form a protective circle around him, officers can be seen jabbing the young man with their wooden poles.\par \par \uc2 Observers said that while police brutality was common in poorer, more rural areas of India, it was extremely unusual to see it explode on such a scale in the capital.\par \par \uc2 Waqar Azam, a 26-year-old student, was studying in the university library when students burst in and yelled that the police were coming. The students locked the doors. Moments later, tear gas canisters crashed through the windows, filling the library with choking smoke.\par \par \uc2 ''What is happening to Indian Muslims today did not happen overnight,'' Mr. Azam said. ''If we don't protest against it now, we will end up living like slaves.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Modi's supporters have dismissed the protesters as being exclusively Muslim, or from a die-hard political opposition group. But in Assam, many protesters said they had voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party and now regretted it.\par \par \uc2 On Monday morning, some 5,000 protesters, of many faiths, gathered in central Guwahati, Assam's capital.\par \par \uc2 One chant echoed across town: ''Down with Modi!''\par \par \uc2 Reporting was contributed by Suhasini Raj from Guwahati, India, by Vindu Goel from Mumbai and by Hari Kumar, Shalini Venugopal, Sameer Yasir and Karan Deep Singh from New Delhi.\par \par \uc2 Students protesting a citizenship law seen as anti-Muslim faced off with the police on Monday.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The government says it is trying to protect religious minorities from being persecuted in Muslim countries. Indian Muslims say the bill is discriminatory, and protests are spreading.\par \par \uc2 NEW DELHI -- The upper house of the \uc2 Indian Parliament\uc2  passed a contentious citizenship bill on Wednesday, bringing a religiously polarizing measure one step closer to law as new protests erupted across the country.\par \par \uc2 The measure, called the Citizenship Amendment Bill, uses religion as a criterion for determining whether illegal migrants in India can be fast-tracked for citizenship. The bill favors members of all South Asia's major religions except Islam, and leaders of India's 200-million-strong Muslim community have called it blatant discrimination.\par \par \uc2 The Rajya Sabha, India's version of a senate, approved the bill in a 125-to-105 vote. It next goes to the president's desk, where it is expected to be signed into law in the coming days.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the legislation in India and international rights groups have called the bill a major blow to India's long-held commitment to a secular democracy. Officials in Prime Minister \uc2 Narendra Modi\uc2 's government have insisted that the legislation would protect human rights.\par \par \uc2 ''The bill provides expedited consideration for Indian citizenship to persecuted religious minorities already in India from certain contiguous countries,'' said \uc2 Raveesh Kumar\uc2 , a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. ''It seeks to address their current difficulties and meet their basic human rights. Such an initiative should be welcomed, not criticized by those who are genuinely committed to religious freedom.''\par \par \uc2 The bill is a central piece of a far-reaching agenda by Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, which has long espoused a Hindu-centric worldview.\par \par \uc2 India is around 80 percent Hindu, with a large Muslim minority, and many of Mr. Modi's supporters believe India should emphasize its Hindu identity as much as possible and become more of an overtly Hindu nation. India's founding leaders, Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, resisted this, insisting on keeping India a secular state and carving out special protections for minorities, including Muslims.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Modi is popular and powerful, and his political party is one of the most dominant forces that India has produced in decades. Still, it has plenty of detractors, and protests over the bill have grown bigger and more violent throughout the week.\par \par \uc2 Late Wednesday, the Indian government shut down the internet in many districts in the state of Assam and called up the army in other areas to quell the chaos. The police were already battling demonstrators with water cannons and tear gas.\par \par \uc2 Protests have broken out in Aligarh, Bhopal, Deoband, Jaipur and several cities in the northeast, where the bill could have the largest effect by allowing Hindu migrants to settle legally in areas where locals have expressed anti-migrant sentiments.\par \par \uc2 The Indian government has promised to protect indigenous rights in these areas, but that has failed to quash suspicions or resentments.\par \par \uc2 More than 1,000 protesters gathered in the heart of Assam's commercial capital, Guwahati, yelling: ''Go Back Modi!'' In other places, angry men set fire to tires and stomped on effigies of Mr. Modi.\par \par \uc2 As the protests spread, many people debated what kind of country India should be.\par \par \uc2 ''The idea of India that emerged from the independence movement,'' said a letter signed by more than 1,000 Indian intellectuals, ''is that of a country that aspires to treat people of all faiths equally.''\par \par \uc2 But this bill, the intellectuals said, is ''a radical break with this history'' and will ''greatly strain the pluralistic fabric of the country."\par \par \uc2 The citizenship legislation, which passed through the lower house of Parliament on Monday, follows hand in hand with a divisive citizenship test conducted this summer in one of India's states and possibly soon to be expanded nationwide.\par \par \uc2 All residents of the state of Assam, along the Bangladesh border, had to produce documentary proof that they or their ancestors had lived in India since 1971. Around two million of Assam's population of 33 million -- a mix of Hindus and Muslims -- failed to pass the test, and these people now risk being rendered stateless. Huge new prisons are being built to incarcerate anyone determined to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some of those who have been arrested have lived in India for generations.\par \par \uc2 The citizenship bill would allow Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsees or Jains who have migrated from Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan a clear path to naturalization in India.\par \par \uc2 Migrants who are Muslim -- which might include people who have lived in India for generations but were unable to produce an old property deed or birth certificate to prove it -- would not be afforded the same protection.\par \par \uc2 The bill excludes Muslim members of religious minorities from neighboring countries, such as the Rohingya who have been persecuted ruthlessly in neighboring Myanmar.\par \par \uc2 International organizations have seized on that in criticizing the legislation.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 United States Commission on International Religious Freedom\uc2 , a federal body, called the measure a ''dangerous turn in the wrong direction'' and said that the United States should consider sanctions against India if the bill passes.\par \par \uc2 Indian officials and other supporters of the bill cite attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all of which are predominantly Muslim, and the shrinking Hindu populations in those countries.\par \par \uc2 Kanwal Sibal, a former foreign secretary and a supporter of Mr. Modi's foreign policy, said the bill ''certainly expresses a pro-Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist sentiment for objective reasons as they are a beleaguered community with no other option.''\par \par \uc2 But, he said, the citizenship bill has ''nothing to do with the Muslims of India. It relates to foreign Muslims who have infiltrated into India over the years."\par \par \uc2 The big question many Muslims in India are now asking is: Who will be considered an Indian citizen? And who will be considered an illegal foreigner?\par \par \uc2 Many of the people who failed to pass the citizenship test in Assam had lived in India all their lives, felt deeply Indian and were despondent to be stricken from the citizenship rolls. Some even killed themselves, including a 14-year-old girl from a small village.\par \par \uc2 Where all of this is going is hardly clear. Even if India rounds up thousands of people the government considers illegal migrants and puts them into the newly built prisons, it will not be easy to deport them.\par \par \uc2 Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan will be unlikely to accept India's determination of citizenship, especially if it seems that most of those being slated for removal are Muslims.\par \par \uc2 India's home minister, Amit Shah, considered the second most powerful man in the country, has vowed two things: to bring the citizenship tests nationwide and to protect Hindus knocked off the citizenship rolls.\par \par \uc2 Harsh Mander, a well-known human rights defender, said in a newspaper column that these measures posed ''the gravest threat to India's secular democratic constitution since India became a republic.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mander, who said he was born a Sikh, said that if the bill passed he would declare himself a Muslim to stand in solidarity with ''my undocumented Muslim sisters and brothers."\par \par \uc2 Protests on Wednesday in New Delhi, left, and Guwahati, above, against a citizenship bill favored by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and, below, Home Minister Amit Shah. The bill could lead to mass arrests.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PARIS -- Hundreds of undocumented migrants stormed the Panth\u233\'00\'E9on monument on Friday, demanding that the French government pay more attention to their plight and grant them legal status.\par \par \uc2 The protesters, many of whom were from West Africa, called themselves ''Black Vests,'' an allusion to the recent antigovernment ''Yellow Vests'' protests. They surged the memorial in the early afternoon, where luminaries such as Victor Hugo, Voltaire and Simone Veil, champions of human rights, are buried.\par \par \uc2 Occupying the memorial for a couple of hours, they sat peacefully under the monument's dome, waving papers and chanting, ''Black Vests, Blacks Vests'' and ''Solidarity with migrants.''\par \par \uc2 ''We are undocumented, the voiceless and faceless of the French Republic,'' read a leaflet shared by La Chapelle Debout!, an advocacy organization for migrants and refugees. ''We come to the graveyards of your great men to denounce your desecration.''\par \par \uc2 As France has grappled with an increasing number of asylum requests in recent years, it has closed its border with Italy, fought illegal immigration in cities like Calais and adopted tougher policies against migrants. Yet studies show that immigration issues remain a top concern among the French, just as they do in other Western European countries like Germany or Italy.\par \par \uc2 The situation has been tense in France's largest cities. Since the immigration crisis of 2015, Paris has been struggling to house migrants, who live in appalling conditions in the northern and eastern parts of the city, where there are not enough shelters. ''The situation is unacceptable,'' Mayor \uc2 Anne Hidalgo\uc2  of Paris, said in April.\par \par \uc2 She and the mayors of 12 other cities urged the government to provide temporary accommodation centers. Between 700 and 1,200 migrants slept on the streets of Paris in March, according to figures released then by the city. That figure is not thought to have changed significantly because the city has provided no new numbers since then.\par \par \uc2 The protesters -- many of whom live in the Paris region in migrant shelters, in precarious hotels or on the streets -- have staged other protests during the past few months.\par \par \uc2 In May, hundreds of ''Black Vests'' protesters occupied a terminal at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport to denounce the ''collaboration of \uc2 Air France\uc2 '' in the repatriation of undocumented migrants to their countries of origin. In June, they stormed the entrance hall of a catering services group in the financial district of Paris, claiming that the company, Elior, exploited undocumented migrants.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, protesters were evacuated by the police a couple of hours after they surged the Panth\u233\'00\'E9on. Videos on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  showed protesters sitting in the streets around the monument's plaza, an area popular with tourists and students on the city's Left Bank. Some chanted: ''What do we want? Documents!'' Others were seen being arrested by the Paris police.\par \par \uc2 The far-right leader \uc2 Marine Le Pen\uc2  called the occupation unacceptable. ''In France, the only future for any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  should be getting kicked out, because that's the law,'' she wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A lawmaker from the far-left party France Unbowed, Eric Coquerel, and a Green Party senator, Esther Benbassa, supported the movement. ''We can't keep having such a restrictive immigration policy, with a reception that doesn't stand up to the humanitarian principles that France accustomed us to,'' Ms. Benbassa said in front of the monument.\par \par \uc2 Since he was elected in 2017, France's president, \uc2 Emmanuel Macron\uc2 , has vowed to tackle illegal immigration and to contain an ever increasing number of asylum requests -- more than 122,000 in 2018, up from 100,000 in 2017 and from 85,000 in 2016. With a tough approach to migrants, he has also tried to head off any progress of the far-right and anti-immigration National Rally, which won the most seats of any French party in the European elections in May.\par \par \uc2 From an asylum outpost in Niger, a hub for African migrants, France has aimed to discourage would-be migrants tempted to try a perilous journey toward Europe and France. To those coming from West African countries deemed safe by France -- Benin, Senegal, Ghana -- chances to be granted asylum are slim. Many others can linger for months before receiving an answer.\par \par \uc2 But the most stringent measure has been an asylum and immigration law passed in 2018 that human rights organizations and lawmakers in Mr. Macron's own party have denounced as too harsh on migrants.\par \par \uc2 Migrants who enter France illegally now have 90 days to apply for asylum under this law, down from the 120 they had before the new law. Rejected applicants now have 15 days to appeal instead of a month, while those deemed ineligible can be held in ''administrative detention'' for 90 days instead of 45, before being expelled.\par \par \uc2 Interior Minister \uc2 Christophe Castaner\uc2  said in November that the number of deportations in 2018 increased by 20 percent from 2017.\par \par \uc2 Follow Elian Peltier on Twitter: @ElianPeltier.\par \par \uc2 Undocumented migrants demonstrated around the Panth\u233\'00\'E9on monument in Paris on Friday. Some chanted: ''What do we want? Documents!'' After a few hours, they were evacuated by the police.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc5}{\*\bkmkend toc5}\b \uc2 The Tricky Language of Border-Speak\b0\par\par\uc2 By CAITLIN DICKERSON \par \uc2 739 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2019\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In all things, words matter, and the emotions they convey can be powerful. For evidence, look no further than the opposing sides in our national debate over immigration, which seem to draw from entirely separate dictionaries when they describe the situation at the border. One person's ''refugee'' is another one's ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .'' It's often a gut-based evaluation in which political views shape language and vice versa.\par \par \uc2 Some Americans look to the border and see huddled masses of desperate mothers and fathers fleeing with their children from violence and destitution. They see asylum seekers who should be offered not just protection, but also opportunity, by their more prosperous northern neighbor.\par \par \uc2 Others view the new arrivals as opportunistic and reckless because they have chosen to put vulnerable children at risk, bringing them on a dangerous, sometimes deadly journey in order to exploit the American legal system to get an unearned leg up in life.\par \par \uc2 Almost no one calls the newcomers ''foreigners,'' though it would be an accurate and relatively dispassionate term to use.\par \par \uc2 For its part, the federal government takes a clinical approach to the discussion. Some people argue that doing so dehumanizes migrants, which can also tilt the debate. For example, in government parlance, the foreign-born are referred to as ''aliens.'' Youth who migrate alone are called ''unaccompanied alien children'' or ''unaccompanied minors.'' Anyone intercepted by the Border Patrol while crossing the Rio Grande into Texas is considered ''wet,'' which, to many ears, sounds too much like a racist term for Mexican people. Even asylum seekers who look for Border Patrol agents and turn themselves in and ask for protection are counted in official data as ''apprehended,'' suggesting, inaccurately, that they were caught trying to sneak into the United States.\par \par \uc2 Readers pay close attention to the words we use as journalists to describe these issues, and for good reason. A few choice terms can shift the entire tone of a story. Years ago, the complaint I heard most often was about whether to call immigrants living in the United States without legal status ''illegal'' or ''undocumented'' (I see problems with both and try to avoid them). But now the questions are evolving. Should the situation with large numbers of people overwhelming Border Patrol stations be called a ''crisis,'' even if some of the chaos is self-imposed by the administration? Should rules intended to protect the welfare of children be called ''loopholes'' because they also make it easier for children to enter and remain in the United States?\par \par \uc2 Recently, a reader pointed out that our Crossing the Border newsletter used the word ''deployment'' to describe a temporary assignment that sent two of my colleagues to live on the southern border for several months. While inside newsrooms, editors and reporters often use that word to describe story assignments of all kinds -- ''Caitlin, you're being deployed to help with coverage of the royal wedding'' -- the phrase itself doesn't typically appear in print, except in stories about a military response in a violent conflict. In this case, ''deployment'' may have conjured images of chaos and danger along the border that don't match up with reality, so we scrapped it. Likewise, President Trump's favorite way of describing the process of detaining and then freeing migrants captured at the border -- ''catch and release,'' he calls it. Sounds like fishing, many people pointed out, and desperate migrants, whatever you call them, are not quarry. Our preference now is to avoid the phrase, unless referring to the way the administration describes it.\par \par \uc2 The challenge here is not that a few of the words that are used in the immigration debate are politically charged, but that the majority of them are. In light of that, one useful exercise might be to pause for a moment, wherever you stand in the debate, and switch out the terms you typically use for those of people who see things differently -- not as a way to make your views more like theirs, but to more fully understand the space between them.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 A federal Border Patrol agent carries a young girl who was too tired to walk after crossing the Rio Grande river south of Granjeno, Tex.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The detention of a high school student in Arizona by Border Patrol authorities has shaken his classmates in Tucson, prompting a protest this week in front of the campus and a march to a sheriff's department headquarters.\par \par \uc2 The student, Thomas Torres-Maytorena, 18, was detained on Thursday during a traffic stop, a statement from the Pima County Sheriff's Department said on Monday. He did not have a driver's license or registration or insurance for the vehicle he was in, and he ''admitted to the deputy that he was in the country illegally,'' the statement said.\par \par \uc2 A sheriff's incident report said that Mr. Torres-Maytorena ''indicated'' he had an ''overstayed visa,'' and that a deputy then contacted Border Patrol. A Customs and Border Protection official confirmed on Tuesday that Mr. Torres-Maytorena was in its custody, and referred to him as a Mexican citizen who is facing immigration charges.\par \par \uc2 The detention of Mr. Torres-Maytorena, a senior at Desert View High School, and the protest reflected a wider unease among students in schools along the country's southern border. Schools have been considered sanctuaries for immigrant students, but immigrant groups point out that it has not stopped federal agents from picking up parents as they drop off their children, or prevented school officials from helping to build cases for \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  cases.\par \par \uc2 A 1982 Supreme Court decision says schools cannot deny undocumented students an education.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, as news of Mr. Torres-Maytorena's detention spread, more than 100 of his classmates gathered in front of the school and then marched several miles to the sheriff's department headquarters, holding signs calling for justice and for his release. Some students said he should be released and allowed to return to classes for the remaining weeks before graduation on May 22.\par \par \uc2 ''We feel that any of us could be taken,'' Daffne Anselmo, a friend of Mr. Torres-Maytorena's, told reporters at the protest, according to footage by \uc2 CBS News\uc2 . He said they could be detained ''just because of a race that we are.''\par \par \uc2 [Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.

Victor Mercado, a spokesman for the Sunnyside Independent School District, said the protest by about 120 students lasted for about four hours.\par \par \uc2 The district is predominantly made up of Hispanic students, he said. ''Issues of immigration are pretty sensitive,'' Mr. Mercado said. ''If they do not have a family member who is in that situation, they know of somebody somewhere whose documentation might have a different status. It is a sensitive issue.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mercado said that Mr. Torres-Maytorena's hearing for the traffic citation was scheduled for May 22 in Pima County Justice Court, but that he did not know when there might be a hearing regarding immigration charges. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Torres-Maytorena had a lawyer.\par \par \uc2 The protest also highlighted tension with the roles played by local law enforcement in the work of federal immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 The statement from Sheriff Mark D. Napier said that the department wanted to prevent what was described as possible ''misinformation'' about the traffic stop before a vote on Tuesday of the Pima County Board of Supervisors on whether to approve federal funds to support coordination between border agents and local law enforcement. Last year, community outrage over new federal border policies and family separations prompted the board to reject those funds, The Arizona Daily Star reported.\par \par \uc2 According to the sheriff's incident report, a deputy was conducting a traffic stop for driving under the influence just before 10 p.m. on Thursday in Tucson. Mr. Torres-Maytorena was driving, and two other Hispanic men were inside the vehicle, the report said. Mr. Torres-Maytorena was given civil citations for having expired plates and for not having a driver's license, registration or insurance papers, it said.\par \par \uc2 The vehicle was registered to Lorena Rodriguez, whom Mr. Torres-Maytorena described in the report as his stepmother. Relatives were allowed to speak with him after he was placed, without handcuffs, in the back of a patrol vehicle, the statement said. Mr. Torres-Maytorena passed a sobriety test, it said.\par \par \uc2 The report said Mr. Torres-Maytorena ''indicated'' he was an ''undocumented \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' with an ''overstayed visa.'' He had a student identification card, the report said.\par \par \uc2 According to an online fund-raising campaign that was started in Ms. Rodriguez's name to help pay for his legal fees, Mr. Torres-Maytorena moved to the United States from Mexico when he was young, along with his mother and two younger sisters.\par \par \uc2 On the campaign website, Ms. Rodriguez described Mr. Torres-Maytorena as a hardworking student and sportsman who has worked in restaurants; he has also done side jobs like yard work.\par \par \uc2 ''People like Thomas are needed in this country,'' she wrote. ''He's a hardworking young man and willing to better his future.''\par \par \uc2 More than 100 students from Desert View High School in Tucson marched on Monday to protest the detention of Thomas Torres-Maytorena, a senior at the school.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MIAMI -- In Florida, immigrants make up more than a fifth of the population, coming from places as diverse as Cuba, Haiti, Mexico and parts of South America. The Republicans who dominate state government have usually kept that carefully in mind.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Legislature gave undocumented children in-state tuition at public colleges. A year earlier, the conservative State House voted to grant driver's licenses to immigrants in the country illegally, though the governor ultimately rejected that policy.\par \par \uc2 But as the national political pendulum swings, so does the country's largest presidential battleground state.\par \par \uc2 In a closely watched debate that has drawn attention across the country, Florida is set to adopt one of the strictest laws in the nation against so-called sanctuary cities and counties. The legislation, expected to be approved by the State Senate as early as Friday, would require local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, and penalize public officials who fail to do so.\par \par \uc2 At play in Florida are Republican base politics under President Trump and the state's new governor, \uc2 Ron DeSantis\uc2 , who ran as a Trump ally and staunch opponent of sanctuary cities even though most analysts agree Florida does not have any. Mr. Trump has talked about releasing migrants apprehended at the border to sanctuary cities run by his Democratic foes.\par \par \uc2 The law would require local governments to use their ''best efforts'' to support federal immigration law, including complying with requests from \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  to detain suspected undocumented immigrants held in local jails until ICE is able to pick them up. Any officials who violate the law could be suspended or removed from office -- or, in the House version of the bill, fined up to $5,000 a day.\par \par \uc2 ''This is about public safety,'' said Senator \uc2 Joe Gruters\uc2  of Sarasota, the bill's sponsor in the Senate and the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. ''If you're a hardworking \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  that is not breaking the law, you have nothing to worry about. If you want to be a criminal and be here illegally, my advice is to go to California or one of those other sanctuaries.''\par \par \uc2 At stake, opponents say, are not just the civil liberties of immigrants, but also Florida's thriving economy and its identity -- at least in the state's biggest cities -- as a melting pot that welcomes outsiders. About 20 percent of Florida's population is foreign-born, though that share is far higher, 53 percent, in Miami and Orlando.\par \par \uc2 ''I really thought we were past this already, truth be told,'' said former Senator Ren\u233\'00\'E9 Garc\u237\'00\'EDa, a Republican from the Miami-area city of Hialeah, where 96 percent of residents are Hispanic. ''It's not the right thing to do. It makes no sense. We're trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. It is politically motivated.''\par \par \uc2 Similar laws have been enacted or considered by Republican legislatures amid anguishing debates in a handful of other states. But some defiant local officials seem to ignore the laws anyway. The Miami police chief has said he would rather be out of a job than order officers to ask someone about their immigration status before helping them.\par \par \uc2 In Texas, where lawmakers passed a law two years ago requiring that local authorities cooperate with ICE, several of the state's largest cities challenged the mandate in court but lost. The Florida bill appears based on the Texas law, though its penalties for local officials are lighter, said Jessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies.\par \par \uc2 ''It's designed to be bulletproof against the inevitable lawsuits that will be filed by advocacy groups in Florida,'' she said. ''Those are going to have a tough time, considering that the Texas law has already passed muster.''\par \par \uc2 Unlike other states, however, Florida's immigrant population includes people from countries that Republicans -- starting with Mr. Trump -- have enthusiastically courted: Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, who are seen as more likely to align politically with conservatives.\par \par \uc2 Democratic state lawmakers, who have been united in their opposition to the sanctuary cities bill, have cast Republicans as hypocritical for saying they want to help Venezuelan immigrants while voting for legislation that could make it easier to deport them.\par \par \uc2 Cuban-American lawmakers have had to grapple with the fact that their families received special immigration privileges when they arrived. One of them, Senator Anitere Flores of Miami, is the lone Republican to oppose the bill in the Senate so far.\par \par \uc2 ''I have an incredibly diverse district that has a lot of migrant communities, a lot of farmworkers,'' she said. ''But I also think that there's a responsibility to represent your community as a Hispanic woman, and to understand that in my family's situation, but for unique laws that were in place for Cubans when my parents came, they could have very well been undocumented immigrants.''\par \par \uc2 Debates in the Capitol have been long and emotional. Last week, the parents of a 21-year-old man killed by a man who had been twice deported spoke to a committee of senators. Then an 11-year-old girl and her 7-year-old cousin spoke to them about their parents who immigrated from Honduras.\par \par \uc2 Representative Cindy Polo, a Democrat from Miami, said on the House floor that her parents came from Colombia on a visa and overstayed it. ''Is that who we are referring to as criminals?'' she said, fighting back tears.\par \par \uc2 National immigration advocacy groups have urged their members to call Florida state senators seen as potential swing voters to oppose the bill or at least support amendments that would narrow its scope. Some organizations have mobilized scores of protesters to Tallahassee, the state capital, where they have held signs and prayed outside the offices of key lawmakers. The Florida chapter of \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  issued a ''travel alert'' this month warning that immigrants' rights could be at risk should the legislation be signed into law.\par \par \uc2 The A.C.L.U. has claimed that ICE issued mistaken requests to detain 420 immigrants who were actually American citizens in the Miami-Dade County jail over the past two years. Miami-Dade was the first municipality in the country to begin complying with the detention requests again, after vowing not to when Mr. Trump threatened in 2017 to withhold federal funds from ''sanctuaries.''\par \par \uc2 Leaders from more than 120 state businesses signed an open letter to the governor and lawmakers cautioning them that the legislation could hurt numerous sectors of the state's economy.\par \par \uc2 ''There goes agriculture,'' said \uc2 Mike Fern\u225\'00\'E1ndez\uc2 , a billionaire health care executive who helped organize the opposition. ''There goes construction. There goes home health service.''\par \par \uc2 But other important business interests have been less vocal in their opposition, at least publicly, than they were during an earlier immigration debate in 2011. That year, \uc2 former Gov. Rick Scott\uc2 , fueled into office by tea-party fervor, tried unsuccessfully to pass a stringent immigration law. The difference, according to Mr. Fern\u225\'00\'E1ndez, is that this year's proposal does not include employers' biggest worry: a mandate to use the E-Verify electronic system to check employees' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Still, business interests might not carry the political weight they used to with Florida Republicans.\par \par \uc2 ''I say this very respectfully: I don't care what the business community thinks,'' Representative Cord Byrd of Neptune Beach, the bill's sponsor in the House, said on the floor earlier this week.\par \par \uc2 After his first year in office, Mr. Scott, who is now in the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2 , distanced himself from harsh immigration rhetoric and the pursuit of contentious enforcement bills, a move seen as wise for his political future.\par \par \uc2 ''He worked really hard to thread this needle: He was tough on enforcement without demagoguing the immigrant community,'' said Ali Noorani, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum. ''DeSantis has kind of thrown that strategy out the window. It makes me wonder what the long-term plans are for Republicans in Florida.''\par \par \uc2 The Republican-led State Senate in Florida could approve legislation against so-called sanctuary cities and counties as early as Friday.

SHEAR and ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS; Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Zolan Kanno-Youngs from San Francisco. \par \uc2 1,219 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 April 2019\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- President Trump's top aides considered an idea to pressure immigration agencies to release apprehended migrants into so-called sanctuary cities represented by Democratic lawmakers, according to several people familiar with the proposal.\par \par \uc2 The idea was floated in an email by a top White House policy adviser in November, when Mr. Trump was furiously condemning migrant caravans from Central America headed toward the southwestern border, the people, including two government officials, said.\par \par \uc2 In the email dated Nov. 16, with the subject line ''Sanctuary City Proposal,'' May Davis, the deputy White House policy coordinator, raised the idea with officials from the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  and Customs and Border Protection.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Davis suggested that migrants who had been apprehended and were slated to be released into border towns could instead be taken to one of several sanctuary cities, which limit how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration officers.\par \par \uc2 The proponents of the idea inside the White House argued at the time that it would help with overcrowding at nonprofit shelters in border towns by transferring the migrants to cities that already embrace the idea of having more immigrants, one official said.\par \par \uc2 Once there, the migrants would be released onto the streets -- potentially sending a message to the Democratic politicians who oppose Mr. Trump's immigration agenda and his demands for a wall along the border with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 ''The idea has been raised by one to two principals that, if we are unable to build sufficient temporary housing, that caravan members be bused to small- and mid-sized sanctuary cities,'' Ms. Davis wrote to the officials at the agencies. She added, ''There is not a White House decision on this.''\par \par \uc2 Matthew Albence\uc2 , the acting deputy director of ICE, objected to the idea, telling the White House that there would be liability issues if a migrant were injured during transport. He also raised concerns that the agency's budget had not been appropriated for that purpose.\par \par \uc2 In an email, Mr. Albence responded that the proposal would create ''an unnecessary operational burden'' on the department and added that he did not know how paying extra to transport migrants to another location was ''a justified expenditure.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Albence is in line to run \uc2 ICE\uc2  after the departure this week of \uc2 Ronald D. Vitiello\uc2 , whom Mr. Trump pushed out because the president said he was not responding to the surge of immigrants in a tough enough fashion.\par \par \uc2 ''This was a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion,'' a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on Thursday evening.\par \par \uc2 In a statement from the White House, an official called the proposal a ''nonstory'' and said that ''these are illegal aliens already being released and sent to U.S. communities every day.''\par \par \uc2 ''The administration's position is that we want to deport -- not release -- illegal aliens,'' the official said.\par \par \uc2 The plan to transport migrants to sanctuary cities, which was first reported Thursday evening by The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , did not go into effect, according to the officials.\par \par \uc2 But the White House did raise the idea again several months later, in February, suggesting that releasing the immigrants into the sanctuary cities would be a way of punishing Democrats for resisting budget requests for more money to detain undocumented immigrants, according to one person familiar with it.\par \par \uc2 A White House official denied that punishing the Democratic lawmakers was the primary purpose of the idea. The official said that it was an effort to deal more efficiently with migrants who were already going to be released.\par \par \uc2 But at that time, officials at the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  once again raised significant concerns about the idea's legality, and the proposal was not carried out.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 , Democrat of California, who represents San Francisco, one of the most high-profile sanctuary cities in the country, condemned the idea on Thursday night.\par \par \uc2 ''The extent of this administration's cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated,'' said Ashley Etienne, a spokeswoman for Ms. Pelosi. ''Using human beings -- including little children -- as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable, and in some cases, criminal.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Etienne added, ''The American people have resoundingly rejected this administration's toxic anti-immigrant policies, and Democrats will continue to advance immigration policies that keep us safe and honor our values.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has frequently, and harshly, criticized sanctuary cities, saying their actions are a violation of federal immigration laws and allow violent criminals who are undocumented immigrants back onto the streets instead of being deported.\par \par \uc2 During his campaign for the presidency, Mr. Trump often cited the case of \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 , who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco. He mentioned the case during a key immigration speech in 2016, months before the election.\par \par \uc2 ''Another victim is \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 ,'' Mr. Trump said. ''Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.''\par \par \uc2 As president, he has continued to lash out at sanctuary cities. In remarks in the East Room in January 2018, Mr. Trump said that sanctuary cities were ''the best friends of gangs and cartels.''\par \par \uc2 One person familiar with the proposal to transport migrants to sanctuary cities said that none of the proposals came directly from \uc2 Stephen Miller\uc2 , the architect of the president's immigration agenda and the top domestic policy adviser in the White House.\par \par \uc2 But the person said that \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  officials understood that Mr. Miller was a chief advocate of the idea. Mr. Miller did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday night.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Albence said in a statement issued late Thursday by the department that ''as the acting deputy, I was not pressured by anyone at the White House on this issue.''\par \par \uc2 ''I was asked my opinion and provided it and my advice was heeded,'' he said. ''The email exchange is clear, and suggesting that it indicates inappropriate pressure is inaccurate.''\par \par \uc2 The idea's existence was revealed as Mr. Trump and Mr. Miller have begun to purge the immigration agencies of officials they believe have not worked aggressively enough to prevent the surge of migrants at the border and to advance the president's hard-line immigration agenda.\par \par \uc2 In addition to Mr. Vitiello, Mr. Trump pushed out \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2 , the secretary of homeland security, and Claire Grady, the acting deputy secretary of the department. The president also appears poised to oust two other top immigration officials at the department in the coming days.\par \par \uc2 A senior administration official told reporters this week that when it comes to the administration's core priorities on immigration, many of them have been ''moving too slowly or moving in the wrong direction'' at immigration agencies.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Protesters outside the federal courthouse in San Antonio in 2017 rallying against a bill in Texas that bans so-called sanctuary cities.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- President Trump delivered a message of bipartisan unity on Tuesday night in his first address to Congress in the new era of divided government, but signaled that he will continue to wage war for the hard-line immigration policies that have polarized the capital and the nation.\par \par \uc2 In a nationally televised speech that toggled between conciliation and confrontation, Mr. Trump presented himself as a leader who can work across party lines even as he pressed lawmakers to build a wall along the nation's southwestern border that leaders of the newly empowered congressional Democrats have adamantly rejected.\par \par \uc2 ''We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good,'' the president said. ''Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future.''\par \par \uc2 Any hopes for a newfound spirit of cooperation, however, seemed elusive as the president and Democrats spent the hours before, during and after the address exchanging partisan political fire, making clear that ritualistic calls for across-the-aisle collaboration were unlikely to transform an environment that has turned increasingly toxic.\par \par \uc2 Republicans jumped to their feet at the president's calls to curb immigration, limit late-term abortions and ensure that the United States does not turn to socialism, even chanting ''U-S-A, U-S-A'' a couple of times as if at a Trump campaign rally. ''That sounds so good,'' he exulted.\par \par \uc2 Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 , sitting behind Mr. Trump for the first time, and other Democrats largely remained in their seats without applauding and expressed only tepid enthusiasm even for his mention of goals intended to appeal to them, like infrastructure and paid parental leave. Ms. Pelosi maintained a polite, even amused smile on her face for much of the speech.\par \par \uc2 But the evening was filled with political theater as the president introduced World War II veterans, Holocaust survivors, the Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, a 10-year-old cancer survivor, a police officer shot seven times at last fall's synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh and the teary-eyed relatives of a couple killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , all sitting with the first lady, Melania Trump.\par \par \uc2 The change in the power structure in a Capitol long dominated by men was on display as Ms. Pelosi and scores of House Democratic women wore white, the color of the suffrage movement, reflecting the fact that 131 women were sworn into the new Congress, the most in American history.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Trump noted this breakthrough, the women leapt to their feet, cheering, dancing and high-fiving each other. ''That's really great,'' he said. ''Congratulations.''\par \par \uc2 He made no direct mention of the issues that may yet come to dominate the year, such as the Russia investigation by the special counsel, \uc2 Robert S. Mueller III\uc2 , or the parallel inquiries that House Democrats intend to conduct into his campaign's ties with Russia and efforts to impede investigations.\par \par \uc2 Instead, he alluded to them only in passing, but pointedly. ''An economic miracle is taking place in the United States,'' he said, ''and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Trump indicated no retreat from his almost singular pursuit of a border wall, directly taking on Ms. Pelosi, who has called it ''immoral.'' He devoted 15 minutes of the hour-and-22-minute speech to immigration with no concession to Democratic priorities like a path to citizenship for immigrants brought into the country illegally as children.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a moral issue,'' Mr. Trump said as Ms. Pelosi sat unmoved behind him. ''No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration,'' he added. ''Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.''\par \par \uc2 In the official Democratic response, \uc2 Stacey Abrams\uc2 , who lost a close race for governor of Georgia in November, scorned the idea of unity from a president who has practiced the politics of division. ''We know bipartisanship could craft a 21st-century immigration plan,'' she said, ''but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abrams, who is African-American, challenged Mr. Trump's history of racial provocation, saying, ''We must hold everyone from the highest offices to our families accountable for racist words and deeds and call racism what it is -- wrong.''\par \par \uc2 The president's speech, built on a theme of ''choosing greatness,'' came at a pivotal moment halfway through the president's term as he seeks to regain momentum after the midterm election defeat that handed control of the House to Democrats and after his failed effort to use a partial government shutdown to extract money for the wall.\par \par \uc2 Stung by his retreat on the government shutdown, Mr. Trump has hardly been in the mood for collaboration with the other party. As he and his team drafted his address in recent days, he has groused about the text, complaining that it was too gentle on Democrats, according to people briefed on the matter.\par \par \uc2 The president insisted on sharpening some of the lines in the speech and rebuffed aides, who urged him to congratulate Ms. Pelosi on her ascension to the speakership.\par \par \uc2 During an off-the-record lunch for television anchors on Tuesday before the speech, Mr. Trump offered scathing assessments of a number of leading Democrats, including some lining up to run against him next year.\par \par \uc2 He dismissed former Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 . as ''dumb,'' called Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2  of New York a ''nasty son of a bitch'' and mocked Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, who he said ''choked like a dog'' at a news conference where Mr. Northam tried to explain a racist yearbook photograph, according to multiple people in the room.\par \par \uc2 Democrats did not wait for the address to pan it. ''It seems every year the president wakes up and discovers the desire for unity on the morning of the State of the Union, then the president spends the other 364 days of the year dividing us, and sowing a state of disunion,'' Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor. He added, ''The blatant hypocrisy of this president calling for unity is that he is one of the chief reasons Americans feel so divided now.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. Schumer via Twitter. ''I see Schumer is already criticizing my State of the Union speech, even though he hasn't seen it yet,'' the president wrote. ''He's just upset that he didn't win the Senate, after spending a fortune, like he thought he would. Too bad we weren't given more credit for the Senate win by the media!''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump arrived at this point in his presidency with the approval of just 37 percent of the public, according to Gallup. In the past four decades, the only times a president headed into a State of the Union address with as little or less support were in 1983 when \uc2 Ronald Reagan\uc2  was struggling with a painful recession and in 2007 and 2008 when \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  was trying to turn around the Iraq war.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump is the only president in the history of Gallup polling to have never drawn the support of a majority of the public at any point in his first two years in office. But while he is the fourth president in a row to lose at least one house of Congress during a midterm election, \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  both bounced back to win re-election, and Mr. Trump has privately expressed confidence that he will, too.\par \par \uc2 After presidents suffer setbacks in midterms, they often reach out to the victorious opposition with words of conciliation, however artificial or short-lived they may be. In Mr. Trump's case, he opened this period of partisan power sharing with a relentless confrontation over his proposed border wall, resulting in a record-breaking 35-day partial government shutdown.\par \par \uc2 That impasse nearly cost Mr. Trump his opportunity to deliver his State of the Union address, as Ms. Pelosi refused to let him come to the House chamber as long as federal agencies were closed and workers unpaid. Mr. Trump backed down and accepted a measure reopening the government for three weeks, but negotiations in the interim have made no more progress toward winning money for his wall -- and the government could close again on Feb. 15.\par \par \uc2 Given that, Mr. Trump's calls for unity were almost surely destined to fall on deaf ears. Even Republicans have publicly rebuked him lately for his plans to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, and party leaders have pressed him not to declare a national emergency bypassing Congress to build the wall.\par \par \uc2 Among those invited by the president to join the first lady during the speech was Joshua Trump, a sixth-grade student from Wilmington, Del., who ''has been bullied in school due to his last name,'' according to the White House.\par \par \uc2 Democrats were making points with their guests, as well. Among those they invited were air traffic controllers who went unpaid during the government shutdown, illegal immigrants who worked at Mr. Trump's properties and transgender soldiers who will be banned under the president's new policy.\par \par \uc2 In addition to Ms. Abrams, other Democrats sought to get in on the action. Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is running for president, delivered her own response shortly before the speech, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who may also run, delivered his afterward.\par \par \uc2 In his address, Mr. Trump assailed Democrats like Mr. Northam for comments in support of easing restrictions on late-term abortions and called for federal legislation cracking down on such procedures, a nod to Mr. Trump's conservative base. He made no mention of the racist medical school yearbook picture that has threatened Mr. Northam's political career, after aides cautioned him about raising that issue.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump also sought to frame the opposition Democrats as too extreme, suggesting that the country was in danger of a socialist takeover. ''Here in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,'' he said, as Republican lawmakers booed. ''We are born free and we will stay free. Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.''\par \par \uc2 The president highlighted what he sees as the accomplishments of his first two years in office, including a growing economy, rising energy production, increased military spending, deregulation and tax cuts. He pressed Congress to approve his new trade pact with Canada and Mexico updating the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump did not outline the traditional laundry list of new initiatives, the way other presidents have, but he did plan to make a national commitment to end transmission of the virus that causes AIDS, with a goal of stopping its spread in the United States by 2030. He repeated past calls for bipartisan measures to rebuild ''America's crumbling infrastructure,'' curb the cost of prescription drugs and approve paid parental leave.\par \par \uc2 The president also talked about his goal of bringing an end to the ''endless wars'' in places like Syria and Afghanistan, the threat he sees from Iran and his bid to force President Nicol\u225\'00\'E1s Maduro of Venezuela to step down. He announced that he will meet for the second time with North Korea's leader, \uc2 Kim Jong-un\uc2 , in Vietnam on Feb. 27-28 to seek his nuclear disarmament.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump ended his address with an uncharacteristic effort at poetry, an ode to America and its common purpose. ''I am asking you to choose greatness,'' he said. ''No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.''\par \par \uc2 Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.\par \par \uc2 Many Democratic women wore the suffrage movement's color.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc10}{\*\bkmkend toc10}\b \uc2 Trump Organization Will Use System to Verify Workers' Documentation\b0\par\par\uc2 By MIRIAM JORDAN; Eric Lipton contributed reporting. \par \uc2 896 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 January 2019\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Trump Organization\uc2  said late Tuesday that it was implementing a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobs at its properties. The move followed reports in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  last month that the president's company was employing people at its flagship golf club in New Jersey who are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 ''We are actively engaged in uniforming this process across our properties and will institute E-verify at any property not currently utilizing this system,'' \uc2 Eric Trump\uc2 , an executive vice president of the company, said in a statement. ''As a company we take this obligation very seriously and when faced with a situation in which an employee has presented false and fraudulent documentation, we will take appropriate action.''\par \par \uc2 Thousands of employers have enrolled voluntarily in the government's E-Verify electronic system, which checks documents provided by new hires against \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  and \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  records. A mismatch suggests that the person is unauthorized to work.\par \par \uc2 All federal contractors must use E-Verify, and 22 states require at least some private and public employers to do so. The federal E-Verify database suggested that the \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  did not use heightened employment document verification procedures at several of its properties, meaning that the chances of employing undocumented workers was high.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  reported in December that undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff.\par \par \uc2 They were kept on the payroll despite the fact that management was aware that they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Victorina Morales, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala, said that a manager at Bedminster helped her secure a new fake Social Security Number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.\par \par \uc2 Since the articles were published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester earlier this month, a development first reported by the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,'' Mr. Trump said in the statement on Tuesday. ''Our employees are like family but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.''\par \par \uc2 He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2 , and that it ''demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.''\par \par \uc2 The Trump Organization\uc2  said last month that it would immediately terminate those who were not authorized to work in the United States. But for several weeks it failed to respond to questions about what measures it was taking to rectify the situation.\par \par \uc2 President Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, from the border wall he has pledged to build -- it recently resulted in the partial government shutdown -- to the workplace raids and payroll audits that his administration has carried out.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump launched his bid for the G.O.P. presidential nomination in June 2015, declaring that the United States had become a ''dumping ground for everybody else's problems.'' Mexico was ''sending people'' to commit crimes and bring drugs. ''They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In a speech in Arizona shortly after, he deemed illegal immigration ''a major, major problem in this country,'' vowing to erect a wall along the southwest border.\par \par \uc2 In August 2015, Mr. Trump told The Times that his companies employed only people with legal work papers.\par \par \uc2 When the Trump International Hotel opened for business in Washington, the president boasted that he had used E-Verify to ensure that only those legally entitled to work were hired.\par \par \uc2 ''We didn't have one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  on the job,'' Mr. Trump said then.\par \par \uc2 About 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States and about eight million of them are in the labor force, according to the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 , a nonpartisan think tank. It is an open secret that many businesses, especially in the service sector, employ them.\par \par \uc2 To deter illegal hiring, \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  conducts audits of businesses, having slapped tens of millions of dollars in administrative and criminal penalties on those found to employ undocumented workers since the early 2000s. These inspections have intensified under the Trump administration.\par \par \uc2 From Oct. 1, 2017, through July 20, 2018, ICE opened 6,093 work-site investigations and made 675 criminal and 984 administrative work-site-related arrests, several times more than in the entire 2017 fiscal year from Oct. 1, 2016 to Sept. 30, 2017.\par \par \uc2 Employers who use E-Verify contend that they struggle to attract enough workers to perform menial, physically onerous jobs. The vast majority of businesses simply require applicants to fill out a federal form, the I-9, and present identification and Social Security card, which they assume are genuine.\par \par \uc2 Victorina Morales was an undocumented worker at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J.

RUEB and ELISHA BROWN; Doris Burke contributed research. \par \uc2 751 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 January 2019\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On the night of Jan. 10, someone walked into a home tucked near the forests that blanket Nevada's northwest border and fatally shot 56-year-old Connie Koontz, the authorities said. Three days later, again under the cover of darkness, someone walked into another Douglas County home about a mile up the road and shot and killed Sophia Renken, 74.\par \par \uc2 Then, three days after that, Washoe County sheriff's deputies searched a home about 40 miles farther north on La Guardia Lane. There, they found 81-year-old Gerald David and his wife, Sharon David, 80, both with gunshot wounds; they, too, were dead.\par \par \uc2 For nine days, law enforcement officials from across the region banded together to both reassure and ready residents who had been shaken by what prosecutors would call ''brutal murders.'' Lock your doors and windows, the authorities said; turn on outdoor lights; keep your cellphones handy.\par \par \uc2 By Sunday -- the 10th day of regionwide panic -- they were able to deliver some calming news: A suspect was in custody; they believed the man, who they have varyingly identified as Wilbur or Wilber Martinez-Guzman, was responsible for all four homicides.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Martinez-Guzman, who is either 19 or 20 years old, had been arrested at a home on Saturday afternoon on felony burglary and immigration charges, Sheriff Ken Furlong of Carson City said, though prosecutors added that they intended to charge him with the murders. Law enforcement officials did not discuss the motive in the killings.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials, Sheriff Furlong said, had notified law enforcement that Mr. Martinez-Guzman had been in the Carson City area for about a year, but ''was likely in the United States illegally and was detainable.'' Jail records show that he is under a hold from \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , which Sheriff Furlong said prevented him from being released on bail. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 ''Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who should not have been in our Country,'' President Trump said in a tweet on Monday. ''We need a powerful Wall!''\par \par \uc2 The disclosure that Mr. Martinez-Guzman may be in the United States illegally has thrust the case into a set of high-profile murders that President Trump has leveraged to bolster his arguments about immigration and the need for a wall along the country's southwest border. The dispute over funding for such a wall remains at the center of a government shutdown.\par \par \uc2 The president has previously called attention to the murder of Mollie Tibbetts, a 20-year-old college student, who the police have said was killed by an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. (Her father has called on people to not exploit her death to promote a political agenda.) Mr. Trump also said it was ''time to get tough on Border Security'' after the authorities arrested a man in California in December who they said fatally shot a police officer and had entered the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, friends and family of the four Nevada victims -- some of whom flanked the police at the Sunday news conference -- were left to grieve.\par \par \uc2 Eddie England, 70, who met Ms. Renken through the Carson Valley chapter of the Antique Automobile Club of America, said in an interview on Tuesday that four lives could have been saved if Mr. Martinez-Guzman had been expelled from the country.\par \par \uc2 He described Ms. Renken as an independent and tough woman who drove a 1930s Ford Model A. Still, she moved to Gardnerville in Douglas County a few years ago to be closer to people -- a situation she felt would be safer, Mr. England said.\par \par \uc2 ''And this,'' he said, ''is what happened to her.''\par \par \uc2 ''It's hard to take.''\par \par \uc2 Alan Squailia, a friend of Mr. David, described Gerald and his wife as ''salt-of-the-earth people,'' who were active community servants and animal lovers.\par \par \uc2 ''If you needed a friend, and needed someone to help you, it was this couple,'' Mr. Squailia, 75, said.\par \par \uc2 Looking at a photograph of Mr. Martinez-Guzman, Mr. Squailia said he could imagine that Mr. David would have invited the young man into his home if he had been looking for help.\par \par \uc2 ''The whole city of Reno is devastated over this,'' he said. ''We still can't wrap our minds around it.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020190123ef1n0006r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump delivered an address to the nation on Tuesday night from the Oval Office to make a broad-based public push for border wall funding.\par \par \uc2 After his speech, Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  of California and Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2  of New York, the Democratic leaders, delivered a response from Capitol Hill.\par \par \uc2 [Read our live analysis and fact checks of the remarks here.]\par \par \uc2 The following are transcripts of both Mr. Trump's speech and the Democratic rebuttal, as prepared by The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 __________\par \par \uc2 The President's Speech\par \par \uc2 PRESIDENT TRUMP: My fellow Americans, tonight I'm speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.\par \par \uc2 Every day, Customs and Border Protection agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country. America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration.\par \par \uc2 It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone. Ninety percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.\par \par \uc2 In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.\par \par \uc2 This is a humanitarian crisis. A crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.\par \par \uc2 This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem.\par \par \uc2 Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe. In fact, safer than ever before.\par \par \uc2 The proposal from homeland security includes cutting edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges to process the sharp rise of unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.\par \par \uc2 Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked congress to close border security loopholes so that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children can be safely and humanely returned back home.\par \par \uc2 Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense.\par \par \uc2 The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year. Vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from congress. The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president.\par \par \uc2 Democrats in congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis and they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.\par \par \uc2 The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only, because Democrats will not fund border security. My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation, but the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government.\par \par \uc2 This situation could be solved in a 45 minute meeting. I have invited congressional leadership to the white house tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.\par \par \uc2 Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.\par \par \uc2 America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders.\par \par \uc2 In California, an air force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.\par \par \uc2 Over the last several years I have met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I have held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief stricken fathers. So sad, so terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before congress does its job?\par \par \uc2 To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask, imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken. To every member of congress: pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen, call congress, and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.\par \par \uc2 This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve. When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country and that is what I will always do so help me god.\par \par \uc2 Thank you and good night.\par \par \uc2 __________\par \par \uc2 The Democratic Response\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER \uc2 NANCY PELOSI\uc2 : Good evening.\par \par \uc2 I appreciate the opportunity to speak directly to the American people tonight about how we can end this shutdown and meet the needs of the American people. Sadly much of what we heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice. The president has chosen fear. We want to start with the facts.\par \par \uc2 The fact is on the very first day of this congress, house Democrats passed senate Republican legislation to reopen government and fund smart, effective border security solutions. But the president is rejecting these bipartisan bills which would reopen government over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall, a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for.\par \par \uc2 The fact is, President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety, and well-being of the American people, and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation, many of them veterans.\par \par \uc2 He promised to keep the government shutdown for months or years, no matter whom it hurts. That's just plain wrong. The fact is, we all agree we need to secure our borders while honoring our values. We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry. We can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation. We can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border. We can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.\par \par \uc2 The fact is, the women and children at the border are not a security threat. They are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened. And the fact is, President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage and stop manufacturing a crisis, and must reopen the government.\par \par \uc2 Thank you. Leader Schumer.\par \par \uc2 SENATOR \uc2 CHUCK SCHUMER\uc2 : Thank you, Speaker Pelosi.\par \par \uc2 My fellow Americans, we address you tonight for one reason only. The president of the United States, having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the congress or the American people to foot the bill, has shut down the government.\par \par \uc2 American democracy doesn't work that way. We don't govern by temper tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down. Hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, and throughout this debate and throughout his presidency, president trump has appealed to fear, not facts. Division, not unity. Make no mistake, Democrats and the president both want stronger border security. However, we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it.\par \par \uc2 So, how do we untangle this mess? Well, there's an obvious solution. Separate the shutdown from arguments over border security. There is bipartisan legislation supported by Democrats and Republicans to reopen government while allowing debate over border security to continue.\par \par \uc2 There is no excuse for hurting millions of Americans over a policy difference. Federal workers are about to miss a paycheck. Some families can't get a mortgage to buy a new home. Farmers and small businesses won't get loans they desperately need.\par \par \uc2 Most presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\par \par \uc2 My fellow Americans, there is no challenge so great that our nation cannot rise to meet it. We can reopen the government and continue to work through disagreements over policy. We can secure our border without an ineffective, expensive wall. And we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security.\par \par \uc2 The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a 30 foot wall. So our suggestion is a simple one. Mr. President, reopen the government, and we can work to resolve our differences over border security. But end this shutdown now.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020190109ef190004u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES -- The police in California's Central Valley are hunting for a man who they believe killed a police officer and is in the country illegally, according to authorities.\par \par \uc2 The shooting occurred around 1 a.m. Wednesday, when Ronil Singh, a 33-year-old officer, was gunned down after pulling over a driver he suspected was drunk in east Newman, Calif., a town of about 10,000 people not far from Modesto. The case was soon thrust into the nation's fractious debate over immigration when President Trump tweeted about it Thursday afternoon.\par \par \uc2 ''There is a full scale manhunt going on in California for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop,'' Mr. Trump wrote. ''Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall!''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Singh, officials said, was an immigrant himself, from Fiji, and had worked for the Newman Police Department since July 2011. He was married and had a 5-month-old son, and after spending Christmas morning with his family went on duty that night.\par \par \uc2 ''I did not know Christmas morning, at four o'clock in the morning when I said goodbye to him and sent him off to his family, that it would be the last time that I saw him,'' Randy Richardson, Newman's police chief, said through tears at a news conference.\par \par \uc2 Chief Richardson called Mr. Singh an ''American patriot,'' and noted that English was not his first language.\par \par \uc2 ''I believe it was his third language,'' said Chief Richardson, who hired Mr. Singh. ''When I sat with him in the chief's interview, he told me he came to America to become a police officer. That's all he wanted to do.''\par \par \uc2 Officials said they knew the suspect's name but did not reveal it, although they did release a photograph of a heavyset, dark-haired man from a convenience store, where the man was buying beer. Authorities said they believed the suspect had entered the United States illegally. ''He doesn't belong here; he is a criminal,'' Adam Christianson, the Stanislaus County sheriff, said at a news conference.\par \par \uc2 The suspect's vehicle, a silver Dodge Ram truck, was later found at a mobile home park.\par \par \uc2 Officer Ronil Singh, 33, was shot to death early Wednesday morning after pulling over a driver he suspected was drunk in Newman, Calif.

Simmons, Handel's 'Messiah'\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE NEW YORK TIMES \par \uc2 1,288 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 December 2018\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Pop Music: Chris Thile With St. Vincent and Jon Batiste\par \par \uc2 Dec. 15 and 22; ticketmaster.com .\par \par \uc2 Yes, Chris Thile is based in New York City, and yes, he is the voice of the nation's folksiest variety show. Since 2016, he's been host of \uc2 American Public Media\uc2 's ''Live From Here,'' a revamped version of ''A Prairie Home Companion,'' Garrison Keillor's decades-long paean to storytelling and Midwestern values. But the dissonance dissolves when considering that Thile is a virtuoso mandolinist for the groups Nickel Creek and the Punch Brothers.\par \par \uc2 For the month of December, Thile and his band, led by super-producer Mike Elizondo, have been broadcasting live weekly from Town Hall in Manhattan. The two remaining shows will star indie rock favorite St. Vincent and ''The Late Show'' bandleader Jon Batiste; and classical ensemble The Knights.\par \par \uc2 There are still stories told and winkingly political sketches performed, but those musical A-listers form the show's core. Expect all the visiting artists to step outside their musical comfort zones. NATALIE WEINER\par \par \uc2 [Video: Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 TV: J.K. Simmons's Double Duty in 'Counterpart'\par \par \uc2 Dec. 9; starz.com .\par \par \uc2 Can there ever be too much of J.K. Simmons? For fans of ''Counterpart'' -- with the masterful character actor Simmons doing leading-man double duty -- the answer is a walloping no.\par \par \uc2 In its first season, ''Counterpart'' chased Simmons around Berlin, playing two versions of Howard Silk that are subtly, yet strikingly distinct. One is a meek office drone at an international agency called the Office of Interchange, while his badass doppelg\u228\'00\'E4nger operates in a secret parallel realm called the Other Side. Their mission: to swap identities and keep the gentler Howard's comatose wife, Emily (Olivia Williams), alive. Then a terrorist attack sends the portal doors slamming shut, leaving the Howards stranded in each other's world.\par \par \uc2 Season 2 of Justin Marks's sci-fi espionage thriller, returning to Starz on Sunday, Dec. 9, finds an awakened Emily bewildered by her faltering memory and the nagging sense that something about her husband isn't quite right. It also sends Peter Quayle (Harry Lloyd), the Office's deputy director of strategy, in search of evildoers within his organization -- while trying to save himself from his wife, Clare (Nazanin Boniadi), now revealed to be the other, deadlier version of the woman he fell in love with. KATHRYN SHATTUCK\par \par \uc2 Classical: 'Messiah' Season Is Here\par \par \uc2 Dec. 11-17; nyphil.org ; trinitywallstreet.org .\par \par \uc2 The holidays are upon us, which means that most of the world's classical music organizations are dedicated, at some point this month, to performing Handel's ''Messiah.'' Two organizations in New York this week offer noteworthy approaches.\par \par \uc2 Billed, flatteringly, as the ''Messiah'' of all ''Messiahs,'' the \uc2 New York Philharmonic\uc2 's run features the conductor Jonathan Cohen overseeing a strong cast that includes the countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo, fresh off his much more outr\u233\'00\'E9 approach to Baroque arias with the glittery ''Glass Handel'' project.\par \par \uc2 The Trinity Wall Street church has been presenting ''Messiah'' since the 1770s, and its choral and orchestral forces, led by its music director Julian Wachner, should provide an invigorating and unorthodox take on the holiday staple. (The Trinity performances will also be livestreamed). WILLIAM ROBIN\par \par \uc2 Art: A Two-Woman Show Full of Contradictions\par \par \uc2 Through Dec. 22; perrotin.com .\par \par \uc2 Through rigorous executions of distorted or surreal forms, Emily Mae Smith's oil paintings and Genesis Belanger's ceramics dramatize the painful contradictions of inhabiting a female body. The high point of ''A Strange Relative,'' their astute two-woman show at Perrotin Gallery in Manhattan, is an installation in which a sculpture and a painting, both on the subject of a woman at her dressing mirror, also mirror each other.\par \par \uc2 On Belanger's table are a loose eyeball, crushed cigarettes, a wad of gum and a tongue emerging from a lipstick tube; in Smith's painting ''Medusa Moderne,'' a disconsolate broomstick with a serpentine green coiffure hunches over a lineup of similar objects. With so many layers of performance and reflection, how can you tell what's real? WILL HEINRICH\par \par \uc2 Dance: Getting Political With Dancenoise\par \par \uc2 Dec. 12-15; newyorklivearts.org .\par \par \uc2 In 1983, the dancers Anne Iobst and Lucy Sexton joined forces as the irreverent duo Dancenoise. Regulars on the East Village performance scene, they quickly became known for their hard-core feminism and gory, kitschy comedy. Knives and fake blood were recurring accessories, as indispensable as combat boots and lingerie.\par \par \uc2 Their appearances grew more sporadic after Ms. Iobst moved to San Francisco in the late '90s, but in recent years they have regained momentum, with a program at the \uc2 Whitney Museum of American Art\uc2  in 2015 and now a 35th-anniversary show at \uc2 New York Live Arts\uc2  in Chelsea.\par \par \uc2 While repurposing some tried-and-true material, the Dancenoise of today dives into the vortex of our current political moment. ''Lock 'em Up!,'' as the Live Arts evening is titled, features the performers Tyler Ashley, Laurie Berg, Heidi Dorow, Connie Fleming, Greta Hartenstein and Madison Krekel, along with films by Charles Atlas and dramaturgy by the choreographer Sarah Michelson. SIOBHAN BURKE\par \par \uc2 Theater: A Ghostly 'Turn of the Screw' at BAM\par \par \uc2 Dec. 12-15; bam.org .\par \par \uc2 There is some chance that the young governess was overeager for the job. At 20, a parson's daughter, she didn't ask many questions of the disarmingly handsome Londoner who hired her to look after his young niece and nephew in the country -- not even when he stipulated that her chief duty would be to leave him undisturbed.\par \par \uc2 So when she starts spotting ghosts around the grand old house, in Henry James's spine-tingling novella ''The Turn of the Screw,'' she doesn't trouble her employer about it. She says not a peep, either, about her conviction that these menacing spirits are eyeing her suspiciously angelic charges.\par \par \uc2 Is she imagining it? Have her sleepless nights sent her over the edge? With onstage cameras rolling, the governess (Lucia Roderique) recounts the eerie episode in ''Strange Window: The Turn of the Screw,'' a new multimedia adaptation by the Obie Award-winning experimental company the Builders Association. Directed by Marianne Weems, the show arrives on Wednesday, Dec. 12, at the BAM Harvey Theater as part of the \uc2 Brooklyn Academy of Music\uc2 's Next Wave Festival. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES\par \par \uc2 [Video: Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Film: After a Cannes Ovation, 'Capernaum' Arrives\par \par \uc2 Dec. 14.\par \par \uc2 When Nadine Labaki's ''Capernaum'' had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, it received a 15-minute standing ovation and predictions of a Palme d'Or win. (It lost out to Hirokazu Koreeda's ''Shoplifters,'' but took home the Jury Prize.)\par \par \uc2 Heart-rending and raw, ''Capernaum'' chronicles the chaotic existence of Zain (Zain Al Rafeea), an impoverished 12-year-old delivery boy full of brooding and bravura in Beirut who is desperate to save his younger sister Sahar (Haita ''Cedra'' Izzam) from marriage to a much older man. Fleeing his callous parents' overcrowded home, he ends up living with Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Ethiopia, and caring for her baby. When Zain is sentenced to five years in prison for a stabbing, he sues his mother and father for, he says, ''giving me life.''\par \par \uc2 Labaki shot 520 hours of footage across six months as she coaxed inhabitants of the city's slums -- including Zain, a Syrian refugee now resettled with his family in Norway -- into re-enacting their struggles. ''Capernaum,'' Lebanon's Oscar entry for best foreign-language film, opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday, Dec. 14, before a national rollout.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc15}{\*\bkmkend toc15}\b \uc2 In America Illegally, and Employed by Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By MIRIAM JORDAN \par \uc2 2,944 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 December 2018\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BEDMINSTER, N.J. -- During more than five years as a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., Victorina Morales has made \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2 's bed, cleaned his toilet and dusted his crystal golf trophies. When he visited as president, she was directed to wear a pin in the shape of the American flag adorned with a Secret Service logo.\par \par \uc2 Because of the ''outstanding'' support she has provided during Mr. Trump's visits, Ms. Morales in July was given a certificate from the White House Communications Agency inscribed with her name.\par \par \uc2 Quite an achievement for an undocumented immigrant housekeeper.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales's journey from cultivating corn in rural Guatemala to fluffing pillows at an exclusive golf resort took her from the southwest border, where she said she crossed illegally in 1999, to the horse country of New Jersey, where she was hired at the Trump property in 2013 with documents she said were phony.\par \par \uc2 She said she was not the only worker at the club who was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Sandra Diaz, 46, a native of Costa Rica who is now a legal resident of the United States, said she, too, was undocumented when she worked at Bedminster between 2010 and 2013. The two women said they worked for years as part of a group of housekeeping, maintenance and landscaping employees at the golf club that included a number of undocumented workers, though they could not say precisely how many. There is no evidence that Mr. Trump or \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  executives knew of their immigration status. But at least two supervisors at the club were aware of it, the women said, and took steps to help workers evade detection and keep their jobs.\par \par \uc2 ''There are many people without papers,'' said Ms. Diaz, who said she witnessed several people being hired whom she knew to be undocumented.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has made border security and the fight to protect jobs for Americans a cornerstone of his presidency, from the border wall he has pledged to build to the workplace raids and payroll audits that his administration has carried out.\par \par \uc2 During the presidential campaign, when the Trump International Hotel opened for business in Washington, Mr. Trump boasted that he had used an electronic verification system, E-Verify, to ensure that only those legally entitled to work were hired.\par \par \uc2 ''We didn't have one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  on the job,'' Mr. Trump said then.\par \par \uc2 [Read more immigration coverage from Miriam Jordan]\par \par \uc2 But throughout his campaign and his administration, Ms. Morales, 45, has been reporting for work at Mr. Trump's golf course in Bedminster, where she is still on the payroll. An employee of the golf course drives her and a group of others to work every day, she says, because it is known that they cannot legally obtain driver's licenses.\par \par \uc2 A diminutive woman with only two years of education who came to the United States speaking no English, Ms. Morales has had an unusual window into one of the president's favorite retreats: She has cleaned the president's villa while he watched television nearby; she stood on the sidelines when potential cabinet members were brought in for interviews and when the White House chief of staff, \uc2 John Kelly\uc2 , arrived to confer with the president.\par \par \uc2 ''I never imagined, as an immigrant from the countryside in Guatemala, that I would see such important people close up,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Morales said she has been hurt by Mr. Trump's public comments since he became president, including equating Latin American immigrants with violent criminals. It was that, she said, along with abusive comments from a supervisor at work about her intelligence and immigration status, that made her feel that she could no longer keep silent.\par \par \uc2 ''We are tired of the abuse, the insults, the way he talks about us when he knows that we are here helping him make money,'' she said. ''We sweat it out to attend to his every need and have to put up with his humiliation.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales and Ms. Diaz approached The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  through their New Jersey lawyer, Anibal Romero, who is representing them on immigration matters. Ms. Morales said that she understood she could be fired or deported as a result of coming forward, though she has applied for protection under the asylum laws. She is also exploring a lawsuit claiming workplace abuse and discrimination.\par \par \uc2 In separate, hourslong interviews in Spanish, Ms. Morales and Ms. Diaz provided detailed accounts of their work at the club and their interactions with management, including Mr. Trump. Both women described the president as demanding but kind, sometimes offering hefty tips.\par \par \uc2 While they were often unclear on precise dates of when events occurred, they appeared to recollect key events and conversations with precision.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales has had dealings with Mr. Trump that go back years, and her husband has confirmed that she would on occasion come home jubilant because the club owner had paid her a compliment, or bestowed on her a $50 or sometimes a $100 tip.\par \par \uc2 To ascertain that she was in fact an employee of the club, The Times reviewed Ms. Morales's pay stubs and W-2 forms, which list the golf course as her employer. She also made available her Individual Taxpayer Identification, a nine-digit number that is issued by the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  to foreigners to enable them to file taxes without being permanent residents of the United States. Having a number does not confer eligibility to work.\par \par \uc2 The Times also examined the documents Ms. Morales presented as proof that she was entitled to work -- a permanent resident card, or green card, and a Social Security card, both of which she said she purchased from someone in New Jersey who produced counterfeit documents for immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Times ran Ms. Morales's purported Social Security number through several public records databases and none produced a match, which is often an indication that the number is not valid. The number on the back of the green card that Ms. Morales has on file at the golf course does not correspond to the format of numbers used on most legitimate resident cards. For example, it includes initials that do not match those of any immigration service centers that issue the cards.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Diaz produced similar documents, though since she has gained legal residence she has been issued a genuine Social Security card and green card.\par \par \uc2 The Trump Organization\uc2 , which owns the golf course, did not comment specifically on Ms. Morales or Ms. Diaz. ''We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices,'' Amanda Miller, the company's senior vice president for marketing and corporate communications, said in a statement. ''If an employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately.''\par \par \uc2 The White House declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 That Ms. Morales appeared able to secure employment with what she said were fake documents is not surprising: An estimated eight million unauthorized immigrants are in the labor force, and it is an open secret that many businesses, especially in the service sector, hire them.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has a long history of relying on immigrants at his golf and hotel properties. Though he signed a ''Buy American, Hire American'' executive order in 2017 tightening the conditions for visas for foreign workers, his companies have hired hundreds of foreigners on guest-worker visas.\par \par \uc2 In hiring workers who are already in the United States, employers are required to examine identity and work authorization documents and record them on an employment eligibility form. But companies are not required in most cases to take additional steps to verify the authenticity of documents. Because falsifying these documents is so easy, E-Verify, which is required in 22 states, goes the extra step of checking them against records kept by the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  and the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The federal list posted online of employers who use the E-Verify system includes Mr. Trump's golf club in North Carolina, a state that requires it, but the Bedminster club in New Jersey, where it is not required under state law, does not appear on the list.\par \par \uc2 During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for expanding the program to workplaces around the country. So far, that has not happened.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump opened his trophy club in the affluent horse country of Somerset County, N.J., in 2004. After buying the 504-acre property from a group of investors in 2002, Mr. Trump planted a sweeping colonnade of maple trees at the entrance and built two 18-hole golf courses, their design inspired by the gardens of Versailles. The membership initiation fee is more than $100,000.\par \par \uc2 The property has an estimated 40 to 80 employees, depending on the season; the bulk of the basic service workers are foreign-born. Immigrants keep the greens watered and manicured. They clean and maintain the cottages and suites that surround the junior Olympic-size heated pool.\par \par \uc2 The president has spent all or part of about 70 days at Bedminster since taking office. He has a two-story residence on the property; his daughter \uc2 Ivanka Trump\uc2  and her husband, \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2 , were married at the club in 2009, and also have a cottage.\par \par \uc2 The job at Bedminster, at which Ms. Morales earns $13 an hour, is one of several she said she has held since arriving in the United States in 1999, crossing undetected into California after a journey of nearly six weeks by bus and on foot.\par \par \uc2 After she first arrived in Los Angeles, a contact provided her with a false Social Security number and an identification card that she was told would enable her to secure employment. She then flew to New Jersey, where she joined her husband, who had arrived months earlier.\par \par \uc2 In early 2013, a friend who worked at the Trump golf club told her that management was looking for housekeepers.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales was keen: The pay would be $10 an hour, higher than the $8.25 that she was earning cleaning guest rooms at a hotel.\par \par \uc2 According to her account, when she arrived for her interview, the housekeeping supervisor showed her around and asked her to demonstrate how she cleaned. The supervisor asked her to report to work the next morning at 6 a.m. -- with her documents.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales said she told her she had no legal working documents. ''I told her I don't have good papers. She told me to bring what I used at the hotel,'' Ms. Morales recalled.\par \par \uc2 By the time Ms. Morales was hired, Ms. Diaz had been working at the club since 2010 and had the job of cleaning Mr. Trump's residence.\par \par \uc2 She said she washed and ironed Mr. Trump's white boxers, golf shirts and khaki trousers, as well as his sheets and towels. Everything belonging to Mr. Trump, his wife, Melania, and their son, Barron, was washed with special detergent in a smaller, separate washing machine, she said.\par \par \uc2 ''He is extremely meticulous about everything. If he arrives suddenly, everyone runs around like crazy'' because Mr. Trump inspects everything closely, Ms. Diaz said.\par \par \uc2 She recalled a nervous moment in 2012, when Mr. Trump approached her and asked her to follow him to the clubhouse, a renovated 1930s Georgian manor, where he proceeded to run his fingers around the edges of frames on the wall and over table surfaces to check for dust.\par \par \uc2 ''You did a really great job,'' she said he told her, and handed her a $100 bill.\par \par \uc2 That same year, she said, Mr. Trump had an outburst over some orange stains on the collar of his white golf shirt, which Ms. Diaz described as stubborn remnants of his makeup, which she had difficulty removing.\par \par \uc2 When Ms. Morales joined the housekeeping team in 2013, Ms. Diaz was in charge of training her, and began to take her to tend to Mr. Trump's house. In November of that year, when Ms. Diaz quit, Ms. Morales and the housekeeping supervisor took on the job of cleaning Mr. Trump's house together.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales said she will never forget the day Mr. Trump pulled up to the pro shop in his cart as she was washing its large, arched windows. Noticing that Ms. Morales, who is shy of five feet tall, could not reach the top, he said, ''Excuse me,'' grabbed her rag and wiped the upper portion of the glass.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump then asked Ms. Morales her name and where she was from, she recalled. ''I said, 'I am from Guatemala.' He said, 'Guatemalans are hard-working people.''' The president then reached into his pocket and handed her a $50 bill.\par \par \uc2 ''I told myself, 'God bless him.' I thought, he's a good person,'' Ms. Morales recalled.\par \par \uc2 Soon after Mr. Trump launched his campaign for the presidency, in June 2015, Ms. Morales recalled, one of the managers summoned her to tell her that she could no longer work inside Mr. Trump's house.\par \par \uc2 Around the same time, she said, several workers, who she said were also working illegally, had their work days shaved from five days to three days. ''The workers panicked. A lot of people just left,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Two months after Mr. Trump's inauguration, in March 2017, Ms. Morales said that she and other workers received a new employee handbook.\par \par \uc2 Under a section titled ''Immigration Compliance,'' the handbook stated that employees were required to present documents specified by the federal government. ''Those that are found to have falsified information will not be eligible for employment,'' the handbook stated.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales said she was given a new employment form to sign. She could not understand the form, she said, but her lawyer, Mr. Romero, said it was likely an updated I-9 employment eligibility document -- a form that, like the previous one, referenced her falsified documents.\par \par \uc2 Sometime last year, she said, one of the managers told her she must get both a new green card and new Social Security card because there were problems with her current ones.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales provided a detailed account of what transpired, but it was not possible to independently confirm what happened. According to her recollection, she told the manager that she did not know how to obtain new forgeries.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know where to get them,' '' she said she told him.\par \par \uc2 The manager, she said, suggested she speak with a maintenance employee who he said knew where to acquire new documents. When the maintenance employee told her that the new papers would cost $165, Ms. Morales told the manager that she did not have the money. ''He said, 'don't worry. I will lend you the money,''' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales said the maintenance worker drove her to a house in Plainfield, N.J., where she waited in his car while he met with someone inside. Ms. Morales said that she had no record or recollection of the address.\par \par \uc2 The next day, she said, the maintenance worker brought her a new Social Security card and a realistic-looking green card to replace the one that had ''expired.'' She said the manager made copies of them for files kept at the club's administrative headquarters.\par \par \uc2 Now that Mr. Trump was president, there was more than the usual excitement whenever he arrived. Ms. Morales was still asked to clean Mr. Trump's residence on occasion, and had to wear a Secret Service pin whenever the president was on site, she said, most likely identifying her as an employee, though the pins did not mean employees had a security clearance.\par \par \uc2 As the months went on, she and other employees at the golf club became increasingly disturbed about Mr. Trump's comments, which they felt demeaned immigrants from Mexico and Central America. The president's tone seemed to embolden others to make negative comments, Ms. Morales said. The housekeeping supervisor frequently made remarks about the employees' vulnerable legal status when critiquing their work, she said, sometimes calling them ''stupid illegal immigrants'' with less intelligence than a dog.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Morales expects she will have to leave her job as soon as her name and work status are made public. She understands she could be deported. On Thursday, she spent the day with her lawyer, and as news of her disclosures spread, she did not answer a phone call from her supervisor at the golf course. She said she did not expect to return to work.\par \par \uc2 She said she is certain that her employers -- perhaps even Mr. Trump -- knew of her unlawful status all along.\par \par \uc2 ''I ask myself, is it possible that this se\u241\'00\'F1or thinks we have papers? He knows we don't speak English,'' Ms. Morales said. ''Why wouldn't he figure it out?''\par \par \uc2 Maggie Haberman and Ben Protess contributed reporting from New York. Kitty Bennett contributed research.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Victorina Morales has worked at a Trump golf club since 2013.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc16}{\*\bkmkend toc16}\b \uc2 Suspect's Dark Turn on Social Media: From Food Photos to Partisan Fury\b0\par\par\uc2 By KEVIN ROOSE \par \uc2 1,508 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 October 2018\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Until 2016, Cesar Altieri Sayoc Jr.'s life on social media looked unremarkable. On his \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page, he posted photos of decadent meals, gym workouts, scantily clad women and sports games -- the stereotypical trappings of middle-age masculinity.\par \par \uc2 But that year, Mr. Sayoc's social media presence took on a darker and more partisan tone. He opened a new \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account and began posting links to sensational right-wing news stories, adding captions like ''Clinton busted exposed rigging entire election.'' On \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , his anodyne posts gave way to a feed overflowing with pro-\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  images, news stories about Muslims and the Islamic State, far-fetched conspiracy theories and clips from Fox News broadcasts.\par \par \uc2 By the time he was arrested in Florida on Friday, charged with sending pipe bombs to at least a dozen of President Trump's critics, Mr. Sayoc appeared to fit the all-too-familiar profile of a modern extremist, radicalized online and sucked into a vortex of partisan furor. In recent weeks, he had posted violent fantasies and threats against several people to whom pipe bombs were addressed, including Representative \uc2 Maxine Waters\uc2 , a California Democrat, and former Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 . His vehicle, a white van plastered with right-wing slogans, came to resemble a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  feed on wheels.\par \par \uc2 ''He went from posting pictures of women, real estate, dining and cars to posting pictures of ISIS, guns and people in jail,'' said Jonathan Albright, the research director for Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism. ''It's a remarkable change.''\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  was warned at least once about Mr. Sayoc's threatening behavior, but failed to act. On Friday, the company took down Mr. Sayoc's accounts after he was named as a suspect.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , which also took down his account on Friday, condemned his actions in a statement. ''There is absolutely no place on our platforms for people who attempt such horrendous acts.''\par \par \uc2 But before Mr. Sayoc's accounts were taken down, The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  archived their contents. And a closer study of his online activity reveals the evolution of a political identity built on a foundation of false news and misinformation, and steeped in the insular culture of the right-wing media. For years, these platforms captured Mr. Sayoc's attention with a steady flow of outrage and hyperpartisan clickbait and gave him a public venue to declare his allegiance to Mr. Trump and his antipathy for the president's enemies.\par \par \uc2 On social media, none of this behavior is particularly out of the ordinary. In fact, to many of his followers, Mr. Sayoc may have appeared to be just one of many partisan keyboard warriors working through their rage.\par \par \uc2 ''There are tons of people like this,'' said Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah who studies social media. ''He took these memes to their most violent extreme, but this is a pretty big world on social media.''\par \par \uc2 The genesis of Mr. Sayoc's partisan awakening may never be known, but hints of it first appeared on his \uc2 Facebook\uc2  feed in early 2016, as the primary season for the presidential election was starting.\par \par \uc2 That February, he posted a link to a conspiracy theory video on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  titled, ''Is \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  THE ANTICHRIST -- 100% PROOF Is There!'' Days later, he posted a second \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video, ''Satan Sent Obama to Destroy America,'' and a clip featuring \uc2 Sean Hannity\uc2 , the Fox News host, which was called, ''MUST HEAR: Sean Exposes \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Crime Stats.'' He posted several anti-Obama videos multiple times on his feed, interspersed with stories about personal finance and his favorite soccer players.\par \par \uc2 By the summer, Mr. Sayoc's social media activity was all politics, all the time.\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , he posted stories from Infowars, World Net Daily, Breitbart and other right-wing websites. His posts, which rarely included commentary apart from the links, showed a fascination with Islamist terrorism, illegal immigration and anti-Clinton conspiracy theories. (On one post, a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  link, he wrote: ''The Clinton have funneled two billion dollars through Clinton foundation.'')\par \par \uc2 In October, a month before Mr. Trump's election, Mr. Sayoc posted a series of photos of himself at a Trump campaign rally, watching from the crowd in a red ''Make America Great Again'' hat.\par \par \uc2 Despite his prolific posting, Mr. Sayoc does not appear to have gained a wide audience. His \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account was followed by fewer than 1,200 people as of Friday morning, and although he had nearly 3,000 friends on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , many of his posts were never commented on or shared.\par \par \uc2 He did, however, display an unusual tendency to post stories and images over and over again, sometimes dozens of times.\par \par \uc2 But while Mr. Sayoc may have been an outlier in frequency, the content he posted resembled the kind of highly charged outrage bait that is a staple of partisan internet circles. On social platforms, where polarized content is often better at generating engagement than nuanced conversations, there can be a temptation to veer into more extreme territory to stand out.\par \par \uc2 ''People find people with similar interests, and it naturally leads them to encounters and relationships and information they wouldn't necessarily find offline,'' Mr. Albright said. ''Being able to find similar communities can really lead you down a path of radicalization.''\par \par \uc2 For years, many of Mr. Sayoc's posts simply reshared existing images, links and videos. But in recent months, he began to create more of his own posts. He began posting less on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and dialed up his efforts on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , where he could engage directly with his political heroes and foes.\par \par \uc2 In March, he cheered on Republican tax policies, saying, ''You don't have pay taxes on bonus yea Trump Trump Trump.''\par \par \uc2 In June, he tweeted a birthday card to Mr. Trump and wrote: ''Happy Birthday to greatest gift from God President Trump Trump Trump. The greatest result President ever and economy for all American Soaring 2016-2024 Trump Trump Trump.''\par \par \uc2 And on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , he began to attack prominent liberals, especially those who had either criticized or been criticized by Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 He called Lena Dunham, the outspoken creator of ''Girls'' on HBO, ''Hollywood slime'' and told her to ''stick your show where sun doesn't shine.''\par \par \uc2 He became obsessed with David Hogg, a student who survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida and had become a prominent advocate for gun control. He tweeted out dozens of photos of Mr. Hogg, accusing him of being a ''fake fraud'' and being paid by the billionaire \uc2 George Soros\uc2 , a benefactor of liberal causes and a frequent target of the right.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, Mr. Sayoc's behavior changed. His posts took on a darker, more obsessive tone, often accompanied by threats of violence and gory images of bloody animal carcasses. No longer mistakable as an everyday internet partisan, he posted repeatedly about ''unconquered Seminoles,'' a reference to the tribe that he appears to have adopted. (It also appeared on his van.) And on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , his messages turned dark and sinister.\par \par \uc2 He directed a tweet at Ms. Waters, the California Democrat, with a photo of what appeared to be her house. The message read: ''see you soon.''\par \par \uc2 He sent another to \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 ., an attorney general under Mr. Obama, that read, ''See u soon Tick Tock.'' And he told Zephyr Teachout, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for attorney general in New York, that he had a surprise waiting for her. ''We Unconquered Seminole Tribe have a special Air boat tour lined up for you here in our Swamp Everglades,'' he wrote. ''See u real soon. Hug your loved ones.''\par \par \uc2 Many recipients of Mr. Sayoc's social media wrath most likely disregarded it, or wrote him off as just another overzealous troll. But the few who tried to sound the alarm appear to have been ignored. This month, Rochelle Ritchie, a Democratic political commentator, complained to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that Mr. Sayoc had sent her a threatening message after she appeared on Fox News. The company replied that Mr. Sayoc's tweet did not violate its rules against abuse.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, after Mr. Sayoc was named as the bombing suspect, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  apologized for the decision, saying Mr. Sayoc's threatening tweet to Ms. Ritchie ''clearly violated our rules and should have been removed.''\par \par \uc2 ''We are deeply sorry for that error,'' \uc2 Twitter\uc2  added.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sayoc continued to post unabated until as recently as Wednesday, even as the authorities were conducting a manhunt for the sender of the explosives that had been mailed to prominent Democrats. He sent a tweet to the \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account at the website TMZ that criticized \uc2 Andrew Gillum\uc2 , the Democratic candidate for governor in Florida, for raising campaign funds from Mr. Soros and other liberal donors.\par \par \uc2 ''$500,000 Soros puppet,'' read the text over the image.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, Cesar Sayoc Jr.'s posts on Twitter and Facebook took on a more obsessive tone. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020181028eeas000ab\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ROME -- ''Jackal!'' the activists shouted as \uc2 Matteo Salvini\uc2 , the strongman of Italy's populist government, arrived at the other end of the street. ''Jackal!''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Salvini, the leader of the anti-migrant League party and the country's tough interior minister, had arrived to leave a rose at the entrance of a drug den where the police had discovered the body of a 16-year-old girl, Desir\u233\'00\'E9e Mariottini, who they believe had been repeatedly raped, perhaps while unconscious, and left for dead by African migrants.\par \par \uc2 But the activists in San Lorenzo, a traditionally left-wing neighborhood still scarred from the bombings of the Second World War and now bearing the fresh wounds of drug dealers and lawlessness, refused to let Mr. Salvini pass.\par \par \uc2 They carried banners reading: ''Salvini exploits tragedies. San Lorenzo is not your campaign's catwalk,'' and shouted for him to leave.\par \par \uc2 ''He's using this for his constant electoral campaign,'' said Isabella Troisi, 22, one of the activists. ''Lots of people are afraid of migrants now and he is trying to make them more scared.''\par \par \uc2 The standoff this past week laid bare Italy's widening polarization. But if Mr. Salvini's opponents on the left are now attuned to his media tactics and use of the migration issue to whip up his supporters, they have yet to blunt his deepening political inroads, outside this Roman neighborhood at least.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Salvini's march has only continued. The leader of the formerly separatist party (it used to be called the Northern League) has used a new nationalist ''Italians First'' message to eclipse his governing partners in the Five Star Movement and become the driving force of Italy's government.\par \par \uc2 He has cracked down on migrants, raised the alarm about a drug and security emergency, led a rebellion against the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , insulted its leaders as drunks, sated the news media with a constant stream of outrageous sound bites, baited the left into overreactions by purposefully echoing Mussolini and filled the widespread Italian demand for a law-and-order heavy.\par \par \uc2 On Friday afternoon on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , he applauded the capture of, as he put it, a ''fourth maggot'' who ''(what a coincidence), is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 His support has grown so strong around Italy that he appears to have started thinking the unthinkable: conquering Rome with a League candidate for mayor, and thus governing a capital his party once explicitly ran against and disparaged as the ''Great Thief.''\par \par \uc2 Virginia Raggi, the mayor of Rome with the Five Star Movement, is deeply embattled as the city has fallen into disastrous degradation, with garbage strewn across dark, broken streets and drug use spiking in bleak neighborhoods. She is also facing a sentence in November on charges that she had lied to the local authorities, which she denies.\par \par \uc2 If she were to resign, which is unlikely, elections could be held next May, and Mr. Salvini's League is in a better position than ever to capture the capital. ''A League Mayor in the Capitol,'' read an exuberant headline of the conservative newspaper Il Tempo.\par \par \uc2 In the death of Ms. Mariottini, Mr. Salvini, one of the most politically attuned leaders in Europe, heard a clarion call that he has heard before and that has helped propel his political rise.\par \par \uc2 A month before the Italian elections in March that brought him to power, the dismemberment of another troubled Roman teenage girl, Pamela Mastropietro, allegedly by a Nigerian drug dealer, inflamed a nation already fed up with illegal migration. Mr. Salvini helped it along, calling her alleged assailants maggots and proof that migration had gotten out of control.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Mastropietro's death soon led to a shooting spree against migrants by a right-wing extremist in the small town of Macerata, where she had died, and it prompted a more lasting national uproar that has fed the dramatic rise of the League party and Mr. Salvini.\par \par \uc2 The death of Ms. Mariottini provided a similar opening for Mr. Salvini, who uses social media as a constant and attention-demanding megaphone: He wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  Wednesday morning that he had attended an emergency public order meeting with Ms. Raggi.\par \par \uc2 (While the mayor has ordered an end to drinking after 9 p.m. in San Lorenzo, Mr. Salvini has proposed the ''chemical castration'' of rapists.)\par \par \uc2 Then, he wrote, he would go to San Lorenzo: ''A 16-year-old girl can't die, raped like this, in a receptacle of crime and drug dealers. I'm going to see it in person. #ZeroTolerance.''\par \par \uc2 But before he arrived, cameramen, TV anchors and activists crowded in front of Via dei Lucani 22, the entrance to the drug den where the girl had been found and where the words ''Justice for Desir\u233\'00\'E9e'' was now written amid red hearts.\par \par \uc2 ''We don't want xenophobes in San Lorenzo,'' said Carlo Caponi, a member of the anti-fascist National Association of Italian Partisans, who waved his organization's flag. ''We defend the Constitution and everyone's civil rights.''\par \par \uc2 The protesters exchanged sharp words with a few of Mr. Salvini's supporters, who made sure their voices were heard.\par \par \uc2 ''Pamela was killed by four Nigerians, and Desir\u233\'00\'E9e was killed by Moroccans!'' screamed Ilenia Curti, 39, of San Lorenzo. (The police have so far held two Senegalese men, a Nigerian and a Ghanaian in connection with Ms. Mariottini's death.) When the activists challenged her, she screamed, ''Italians First!''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Curti, whose \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page is peppered with posts expressing rage at the killing of Ms. Mastropietro in Macerata and admiration for Mussolini, screamed that the students and activists were ''filthy'' and ''pimps.''\par \par \uc2 Suddenly, a stir ran through the crowd.\par \par \uc2 ''He's coming,'' one reporter shouted, and the scrum rushed away from Ms. Curti and the protesters to the other end of the street.\par \par \uc2 Moments later, Mr. Salvini, wearing a cobalt blue suit and open-collar white shirt, was encapsulated in the warm cocoon of the press. The former disc jockey immediately began talking.\par \par \uc2 He said that by February, there would be 154 more police and 100 more paramilitary police officers in Rome ''thanks to a courageous economic budget that Brussels would like us to change, but we will not change a comma.''\par \par \uc2 He said he would have gladly left the rose that he had brought with him in the car if it weren't for ''those imbeciles.'' He said, ''We're going to hurt the drug dealers.'' He said he would act to get rid of an ''idiotic law of the left-wing government'' that had decriminalized drug use.\par \par \uc2 He would bulldoze the drug den and nearly 100 more abandoned buildings like it around the city. (He said that clearing a famous squat of post-fascists, called CasaPound, was not a top priority.)\par \par \uc2 ''I am here to pledge myself to the normal people from the neighborhood who don't want drug dealing, chaos, prostitution, rackets. To clean it up,'' he said, adding that he couldn't explain why no one had done anything before, but he would act with a ''heavy hand.''\par \par \uc2 At a certain point, Mr. Salvini broke free from the scrum and ran up the street, but the protesters, screaming that he should leave the neighborhood, held firm. Mr. Salvini stopped, and the protective orbit of camera satellites surrounded him again.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Salvini's movable news conference seemed stuck. After more than 20 minutes, he retreated to his car and drove off.\par \par \uc2 ''We had had a good result in not allowing him onto the street,'' Ms. Troisi, the activist, said triumphantly. But she acknowledged that Mr. Salvini seemed always more popular in the city and the country, and that he always seemed to come out on top.\par \par \uc2 A couple hours after the rally broke up, Mr. Salvini returned unannounced and left a rose in front of the gate.\par \par \uc2 La Stampa, one of the nation's leading newspapers, published a picture of it on its front page. The headline: ''The League Prepares to Conquer Rome.''\par \par \uc2 A memorial in the San Lorenzo district of Rome, where the body of Desir\u233\'00\'E9e Mariottini, 16, was found. African migrants were arrested.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 An Oct. 2 editorial criticized the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  and our unaccompanied immigrant children program for doing what The Times recommended that our agency do during the previous administration.\par \par \uc2 During 2014's surge of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children, you wrote that the department ''badly needs to increase its ability to shelter thousands properly as they wait to reunite with their parents and be seen in immigration courts.''\par \par \uc2 Now you are claiming that, by opening stopgap shelters to house children while more permanent shelters come on line, the department is letting children ''rot in the desert.''\par \par \uc2 So which is it? In temporary shelters, as required by law, we provide housing, food, recreation, health care and, contrary to your implication, legal aid and educational services. Even though we have the highest ever number of children in our program, no children have been backed up at border stations waiting for beds, as happened in 2014.\par \par \uc2 When insufficient background checks for sponsors who receive unaccompanied immigrant children led to human trafficking and other horrible situations, the previous administration was rightly criticized. Yet when the Trump administration instituted further vetting for sponsors, reducing reports of mistreatment, you expressed outrage at any delays that can result.\par \par \uc2 The only solution is for Congress to address our broken immigration system. Until then, the department will compassionately and professionally administer a large-scale child welfare program for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children, providing for their security, safety and well-being.\par \par \uc2 Lynn Johnson\par \par \uc2 Washington\par \par \uc2 The writer is assistant secretary for children and families, Department of Health and Human Services.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''Migrant Children Are Moved in Darkness to Tent City in Texas'' (news article, Oct. 1):\par \par \uc2 In their asylum cases, I represent Ms. L. and the 6-year-old daughter of Ms. L., who is the Congolese plaintiff in the class action lawsuit that stopped the Trump administration's separation of immigrant families this summer.\par \par \uc2 When I took on these asylum cases pro bono, I thought that our country had hit rock bottom in its inhumane treatment of migrant children and families. But the administration continues to up the ante in its cruelty.\par \par \uc2 As it takes unaccompanied immigrant children away from federal shelters in the middle of the night to a tent city in Texas that resembles an internment camp, there is apparently no plan to ensure that the children can maintain contact with their immigration lawyers.\par \par \uc2 As a lawyer who has provided pro bono representation to unaccompanied children, I know how detrimental this separation will be to their cases and their well-being. They face an increasingly hostile and labyrinthine immigration court system, many while still coping with trauma from the persecution that forced them to flee home in the first place.\par \par \uc2 With the children's families and other potential sponsors increasingly fearful that stepping forward to get their children out of government custody might result in their own deportation, the rapidly expanding population of detained unaccompanied children -- held in tents, deprived of lawyers and due process, with no apparent oversight -- is this administration's next crisis in the making.\par \par \uc2 Ann Marie Walsh\par \par \uc2 Chicago\par \par \uc2 The writer is co-chairwoman of the National Immigrant Justice Center Leadership Board.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020181005eea500031\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In his first appearance before the nation, Judge \uc2 Brett M. Kavanaugh\uc2  positioned himself as an ally of social change for women in America. Standing beside President Trump at the White House, Judge Kavanaugh spoke of being a father of daughters and a coach to a girls' basketball team. He hailed his mother's legal career. He boasted that most of his clerks had been women.\par \par \uc2 Coming in the era of #MeToo and the Women's March, of greater attention to wage inequality for women and campus sexual assaults, Judge Kavanaugh was trying to reassure the many women around the country who may have been assessing him, and the president beside him, warily. He was, after all, a 53-year-old jurist and ambitious veteran of Republican politics who would be a potentially decisive vote on litigation over women's rights -- including the right to terminate a pregnancy.\par \par \uc2 But if Judge Kavanaugh's nomination was freighted with import for women, the battle over his confirmation has swelled into an event of titanic consequence in the country's evolution on matters of gender and women's equality. A judge who could well overturn Roe v. Wade -- handpicked by a president who has faced allegations of sexual misconduct -- now faces an accusation of sexual assault that has plunged the Senate into chaos less than seven weeks before an election. Judge Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.\par \par \uc2 The fate of his nomination and the Senate's treatment of his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, who said Saturday she was willing to testify in the coming week, have the makings of a pivot point in American politics -- the crest of a wave building since Mr. Trump's election. Women have marched and voted in powerful numbers. They have run for office with record-breaking success. And women of all political stripes have come forward with new confidence to identify and challenge men who have exploited them. Dr. Blasey, a 51-year-old California professor, was 15 at the time of the alleged assault.\par \par \uc2 The likely public testimony by Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh would be a wrenching apex in the decades-long struggle over the legal and social status of American women, unfolding in the shadow of a presidency that has profoundly alienated many women.\par \par \uc2 Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, which opposes Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, described the confirmation struggle and the Senate's handling of Dr. Blasey's allegation as a clarifying moment and a test for the country.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a distillation of the entire two years' trajectory for women in this country,'' Ms. Laguens said. ''Are we respected? Are we believed? Are we equal?''\par \par \uc2 Fatima Goss Graves, president of the \uc2 National Women's Law Center\uc2 , said the Senate's reaction to Dr. Blasey's account had already exposed an enormous gulf between the country's political institutions and the outlook of many American women. Ms. Graves warned that attacks on Dr. Blasey would leave a deep mark on the country.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not just a message about Dr. Blasey Ford, it's about survivors and about women,'' Ms. Graves said. ''And if they ignore that, I do not see how that is something that goes away fast. It will be a stain that they carry for a very long time.''\par \par \uc2 [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.]\par \par \uc2 With Dr. Blasey saying she wants to testify before the Senate, her appearance would represent a moment of extreme peril for Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee -- an all-male panel, on the Republican side, where most members have answered Dr. Blasey's allegation with suspicion or resentment.\par \par \uc2 Underscoring the potential for backlash from women, a Republican staff member for the committee, Garrett Ventry, resigned on Saturday after NBC News inquired about allegations of sexual harassment involving him.\par \par \uc2 Yet Republicans -- including conservative women -- have been deeply resistant to reconsidering Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.\par \par \uc2 Their determination to confirm him may put Republicans at odds with the clear tide in American politics since Mr. Trump's election. The victory of a man captured on tape boasting about groping women, over a candidate who would have been the first female president, touched off an anguished backlash among women that has fueled mass marches and huge turnout among female voters as well as the record number of female candidates.\par \par \uc2 But if the cultural mood of the country has appeared to turn strongly in favor of a progressive women's rights agenda, Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is also the pinnacle of a different social movement: the 45-year quest by activists on the right to overturn Roe v. Wade, the court decision that made abortion legal nationwide. For decades, tens of thousands of people have marched in the annual March for Life, and two in five women believe abortion should be illegal in most or all cases, according to the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And allies of Judge Kavanaugh say they are unwilling to back down over a single accusation they distrust, and one that comes after a contentious and highly partisan nomination hearing, calling the stakes far too high.\par \par \uc2 ''The left wants this to be about the veracity of #MeToo, but it's not,'' said Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, a group that led a ''Women for Kavanaugh'' bus tour this summer. ''The election was about the direction of the country. This was a reckoning of what was promised. There's been millions of dollars spent, thousands of volunteer hours spent on behalf of this nominee, it's finally coming to the vote.''\par \par \uc2 At stake for conservatives are not only future court decisions to restrict abortion rights, but also to advance religious liberty laws and define the rights of gay and transgender Americans.\par \par \uc2 Rebecca Hagelin, a conservative columnist backing Judge Kavanaugh, cast the allegation and the way it has been handled as a last-ditch effort to derail the court's pivotal fifth conservative voice. If the issue at stake was primarily women's rights, she says, Senator \uc2 Dianne Feinstein\uc2  would have raised Dr. Blasey's allegation earlier in the summer for better due process.\par \par \uc2 ''They further discredit the entire #MeToo movement if they take down an innocent man,'' said Ms. Hagelin, a former vice president of the Heritage Foundation. ''If the nomination goes through, it will be a victory for anybody who has ever been falsely charged with some sexual abuse accusation.''\par \par \uc2 Critics of Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, who overwhelmingly believe Dr. Blasey's claims, say her allegation has brought the significance of his nomination into sharper focus, after months of efforts by Kavanaugh allies to downplay its potential impact on women. A poll published Friday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal found more Americans now oppose Judge Kavanaugh than support him.\par \par \uc2 Among women, just 28 percent supported Judge Kavanaugh while 42 percent were opposed, including half of college-educated women.\par \par \uc2 That Judge Kavanaugh would become such a contentious figure is in some ways a bitter irony for his supporters. The president selected him over several contenders including Amy Coney Barrett, an appellate judge who is seen as a ferocious opponent of abortion. Hewing to the practice of other recent Supreme Court nominees, Judge Kavanaugh declined throughout his confirmation hearings to address his views on Roe v. Wade.\par \par \uc2 Yet Judge Kavanaugh's nomination was entangled with the politics of sex and gender: He was scrutinized over memos he wrote, as an investigator examining \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 's affair with \uc2 Monica Lewinsky\uc2 , that recommended graphic, even anatomical lines of questioning.\par \par \uc2 Judge Kavanaugh faced questions about his relationship with Alex Kozinski, a mentor of his who abruptly retired as a judge last year amid extensive allegations that he harassed female clerks. Judge Kavanaugh said he had no knowledge of that behavior.\par \par \uc2 In a highly contentious case last year, Judge Kavanaugh ruled against an teenager who, as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was seeking to obtain an abortion while in government custody. Judge Kavanaugh reversed a lower court's ruling -- which was later reinstated -- that would have allowed the woman to get an abortion immediately, instead permitting the government to take more time seeking a sponsor to facilitate the procedure.\par \par \uc2 Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the American Civil Liberty Union's Reproductive Freedom Project, who litigated the case on behalf of the minor, said it had revealed how Judge Kavanaugh or another nominee could ''eliminate access to abortion.''\par \par \uc2 ''All of these decisions about women's ability to make decisions about their bodies, to protect their bodies, are connected,'' Ms. Amiri said, alluding to Dr. Blasey's account.\par \par \uc2 But it is the rhetoric around sexual assault, and Senate Republicans' questionable openness to considering Dr. Blasey's story, that appears most likely to make the ordinarily dry process of confirming a judge a source of lasting division and even trauma.\par \par \uc2 Several important Republican leaders, led by Mr. Trump, have spoken with open contempt about Dr. Blasey, who said in a \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  interview that Judge Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand and sought to remove her clothes by force during a party in high school.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump -- who has consistently expressed skepticism or hostility toward women who accuse men, including him, of sexual misconduct -- has been dismissive of Dr. Blasey. The president wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  Friday that she surely would have filed charges decades ago if the assault ''was as bad as she says.''\par \par \uc2 In North Dakota, where an important Senate race is unfolding and opposition to abortion runs strong, Representative \uc2 Kevin Cramer\uc2 , a Republican challenging Senator \uc2 Heidi Heitkamp\uc2 , waved aside Dr. Blasey's claims in a radio interview on Friday. ''They were drunk,'' Mr. Cramer said. ''Nothing evidently happened in it all, even by her own accusation.''\par \par \uc2 And Republicans in the Senate, including Senator \uc2 Mitch McConnell\uc2  of Kentucky, the majority leader, have largely vowed to confirm Judge Kavanaugh even as they offer Dr. Blasey a limited window to testify.\par \par \uc2 Tarana Burke, who created the #MeToo movement for survivors of sexual assault, said the response to Dr. Blasey from congressional Republicans represented a painful contrast with a larger cultural moment in which women have gained new confidence to confront harassment and abuse by men.\par \par \uc2 Invoking the last Supreme Court nomination to turn on allegations of sexual misconduct, Ms. Burke said the current process might be more wrenching than the 1991 hearings involving \uc2 Clarence Thomas\uc2  and \uc2 Anita Hill\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''It feels almost worse, because we have social media this time around to see vocal pushback from the people around the country,'' Ms. Burke said, ''and we still have an unresponsive set of politicians.''\par \par \uc2 Judge Kavanaugh is facing a sexual assault allegation in the era of the Women's March and other protests, such as one in June outside the Justice De- partment, above. His Supreme Court nomination is also the pinnacle of a quest by activists to overturn Roe v. Wade. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ERIN SCHAFF FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES; AL DRAGO/THE NEW YORK TIMES); Judge Brett M.
