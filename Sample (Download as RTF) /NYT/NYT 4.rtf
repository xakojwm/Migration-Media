All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Americans are usually forgiving when they vote a man into the White House and he wants a second term. Of the last eight elected presidents, all but two -- George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter -- got their four more years. Which is why the conventional wisdom long held that Barack Obama would most likely weather his midpresidency slump to win another term.\par \par \uc2 Then came the debt-ceiling debates of July and August, which seemed to crystallize Obama's vulnerabilities in a way that even the Democrats' midterm disaster of 2010 did not. It's probably because he handled the situation so poorly, simultaneously managing to annoy his base, frustrate swing voters, concede a major policy victory to Republicans and -- through the fear imported into the market by the brinksmanship in Congress and the credit-rating downgrade that followed -- further imperil the economic recovery. On Aug. 12, a week and a half after the debate ended in Congress, Obama's stock on Intrade, a popular political betting market, dipped below 50 percent for the first time. It has hovered just below the 50 percent threshold, usually at about 48 percent, ever since.\par \par \uc2 Obama has gone from a modest favorite to win re-election to, probably, a slight underdog. Let's not oversell this. A couple of months of solid jobs reports, or the selection of a poor Republican opponent, would suffice to make him the favorite again.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, this is an unusual circumstance. Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton and both Bushes all looked like the favorite to win a year in advance of their re-election battles, either having strong approval ratings or good-enough ones accompanied by robust economic numbers. When we look at the last eight elected presidents, only Carter faced a situation worse than Obama's: approval ratings in the low 30s rather than low 40s, the likelihood rather than the mere possibility of a recession, a primary challenge rather than a clear path to renomination and a crisis in Iran rather than a string of foreign-policy victories.\par \par \uc2 The other seven had stronger fundamentals heading into the election year. This includes the elder Bush, who lost despite an extremely high approval rating and a disarrayed Democratic field (Mario Cuomo and others skipped the race at a time when Bush appeared unbeatable). It also includes Reagan and Clinton, who had grave problems early in their terms but who saw their numbers tick upward at the very moment in their presidencies that Obama's have continued to slide. None of this is news to the White House. Following the debt-ceiling debate, Obama's strategists started comparing their boss with the original comeback kid, Harry Truman -- an implicit concession that the president will most likely fight 2012 from behind.\par \par \uc2 The fundamental flaw with much of what passes for political analysis is the tendency to think small. I blame soccer moms for this. Not the moms themselves -- or their more rough-and-tumble companions from four years later, Nascar dads -- but the narrow worldview that these demographic labels represent. The sophomoric strategist thinks he can slice the American electorate into a million little pieces and make it more than the sum of its parts. The smart one recognizes our common bonds.\par \par \uc2 A recent example of the flawed type of thinking came in September, after Democrats lost a special election to fill Anthony Weiner's old seat in a Brooklyn district with a heavy concentration of Orthodox Jewish voters. There was much commentary about Obama's popularity among Jewish Americans and about what this could mean -- most importantly for his prospects in Florida.\par \par \uc2 Obama does indeed have a ''Jewish problem.'' Polls find that his standing among Jews has deteriorated: only about 54 percent of them approved of his performance in the most recent Gallup survey. But this is to be expected when a president has a 40-something approval rating. He also has a Hispanic problem and a problem among the white working class. He has a problem in Ohio and a problem in Florida and a problem in New Hampshire. He even has, to a mild extent, an African-American problem: Obama's approval ratings among black voters are still high, but down to about 80 percent from 90 percent.\par \par \uc2 All of these, however, are symptoms of Obama's larger problems, a set of three fundamental misgivings shared by much of the American electorate.\par \par \uc2 First, many of us understand that Barack Obama inherited a terrible predicament. We have a degree of sympathy for the man. But we have concerns, which have been growing over time, about whether he's up to the job.\par \par \uc2 Second, most of us are gravely concerned about the economy. We're not certain what should be done about it, but we're frustrated.\par \par \uc2 Third, enough of us are prepared to vote against Obama that he could easily lose. It doesn't mean we will, but we might if the Republican represents a credible alternative and fits within the broad political mainstream.\par \par \uc2 Each of these factors, in turn, can be quantified.\par \par \uc2 The first factor, Americans' performance reviews of Obama, can be measured through his approval ratings.\par \par \uc2 The second factor, economic performance, can be measured through statistics like G.D.P.\par \par \uc2 The third factor -- essentially, the ideological positioning of the Republican candidate -- is sometimes thought of as an ''intangible.'' But it can be measured too, and it matters a great deal.\par \par \uc2 As we get closer to the election and more data become available, we can indulge -- even encourage! -- greater complexity in the analysis. Figuring out how Obama is performing in individual states and how this translates to the Electoral College, for instance, requires a fair amount of attention to detail. But it is premature to do that now. Instead we should think big, and focus on the three fundamentals.\par \par \uc2 APPROVAL RATINGS\par \par \uc2 A president's approval rating at the beginning of his third year in office has historically had very little correlation to his eventual fate. In January 1983, Reagan had an approval rating of just 37 percent, but he won in a landslide. George H. W. Bush had a 79 percent approval rating in January 1991 and was soundly defeated. But voters start to think differently about a president over the course of his third year; they view him more on the basis of his performance and less on the hopes they had for him. These perceptions are sharpened by the beginning of the opposition party's primary campaign, which, of course, accentuates the negatives.\par \par \uc2 A president's approval rating toward the end of his third year, therefore, has been a decent (although imperfect) predictor of his chances of victory. Reagan saw his approval rating shoot up to 51 percent in November 1983 amid the V-shaped recovery from the recession of the previous year -- the first sign that he was headed for a big win. Obama's approval rating may have rebounded by a point or two from its lows after the debt-ceiling debacle -- but not by much more than that. In late October, it ranged between 40 and 46 percent in different polls and averaged about 43 percent.\par \par \uc2 There have been two presidents stuck with similarly low approval ratings a year in advance of the next election. Gerald Ford had a 44 percent approval rating a year before his loss to Carter. Johnson had a 41 percent approval rating in November 1967, and although he was eligible for another term, he opted not to run. His vice president, Hubert H. Humphrey, did, and he lost.\par \par \uc2 In fact, since 1944 (when approval ratings first became reliable), there have been five cases in which the incumbent party's president had an approval rating below 49 percent a year ahead of the election -- as Obama almost certainly will, unless he finds the cure for cancer after our issue goes to print -- and each time the incumbent party lost.\par \par \uc2 It would be possible, however, to draw some improper conclusions from this. The more robust way to analyze these data is not just to consider the winners and losers, but also their margins of victory or defeat. Ford and Humphrey (serving as Johnson's surrogate) may have lost their elections, but not by much -- Ford by just 2 points, and Humphrey by 1. The correct conclusion, then, is that other factors being equal, an approval rating in the low 40s a year before the election makes a president a slight but not overwhelming underdog.\par \par \uc2 If Obama's approval ratings were in the low 30s or worse instead of the 40s, that would be another story. The three presidents to fit this description -- Carter in 1979, George W. Bush in 2007 and Harry Truman in 1951 -- saw their parties take big defeats the next year. It would also be another matter if Obama's approval rating were closer to 50 percent. Of the six presidents to have approval ratings in that range a year ahead of the election -- Nixon, Clinton, Bush the younger, Truman in 1947 and Reagan in 1983 and 1987 (with Bush the elder running as his proxy in the latter case) -- all six won.\par \par \uc2 As you go farther up the approval-ratings chart, you begin to see exceptions to the rule: George H. W. Bush's approval ratings were still high in late 1991, but he lost. So were Bill Clinton's in 1999 and Dwight Eisenhower's in 1959, but their coattails were not strong enough to carry their vice presidents to victory. Thus, approval ratings have been a useful indicator but not an infallible one.\par \par \uc2 ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE\par \par \uc2 The direction of the economy over a president's fourth year is also a huge factor in his chances of re-election. Here, there is some good news and bad news for Obama.\par \par \uc2 The good news is that voters have short memories. If there are hopeful signs during an election year, they may be willing to forget earlier problems. Reagan, Nixon, Eisenhower and Truman all won despite recessions earlier in their terms. Moreover, voters' evaluations of the economy are relatively forward-looking. Even if the economy is below its full productive capacity -- as it was in November 1984 when the unemployment rate was 7.2 percent, and as it certainly was in 1936, when it was still around 17 percent -- voters may be willing to overlook this, provided it seems headed in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 The bad news for Obama is that he has already missed his opportunity for a V-shaped recovery, and the prospects for a U-shaped recovery seem uncertain. In October, a panel of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal forecast 2.3 percent G.D.P. growth (adjusted for inflation) in 2012, somewhat below the election-year average of 3 or 4 percent and only enough to provide for modest job creation.\par \par \uc2 Growth rates during an election year are a good but imperfect indicator of electoral performance. The two times that economic activity actually shrank during an election year, 1980 and 2008, the incumbent party lost badly. The two times that it grew by more than 6 percent, 1944 and 1972, it won overwhelmingly. But Eisenhower won a landslide in 1956 despite tepid 1.8 percent growth, and George W. Bush won in 2004 with only 2.9 percent. The economy grew about 5 percent in 1968, but that wasn't enough to save Humphrey.\par \par \uc2 Some political scientists have tried to explain these exceptions by resorting to an alphabet soup of economic indicators, conjuring obscure variables like R.D.P.I.P.C. (real disposable-personal-income per capita), which they claim can predict elections with remarkable accuracy. From the standpoint of responsible forecasting, this is a mistake. The government tracks literally 39,000 economic indicators each year. Although many (say, privately owned housing starts in Alabama) are obscure or redundant, perhaps two or three dozen of them are looked at regularly by economists.\par \par \uc2 When you have this much data to sort through but only 17 elections since 1944 to test them upon, some indicators will perform superficially better based on chance alone, the statistical equivalent of the lucky monkey from a group of millions who banged out a few Shakespearean phrases on his typewriter. Conversely, indicators like the unemployment rate have historically had almost no correlation with election results despite their self-evident importance. The advantage of looking at G.D.P. is that it represents the broadest overall evaluation of economic activity in the United States.\par \par \uc2 There is, however, another problem: economic forecasts are not very good. In fact, they are completely terrible. In November 1995, economists expected the economy to grow at 2.6 percent the next year; it actually zoomed upward by 4.4 percent. In November 2007, they expected it to grow at 2.5 percent, but it shrank by 3.3 percent, as the effects of the global financial crisis became manifest. Frighteningly enough, the margin of error on an economic forecast made a year in advance is about plus or minus 4 percent of G.D.P. Advance forecasts of election results must account for this uncertainty, either by expanding their own margins of error to accommodate it or by making their predictions conditional upon different economic situations (we will pursue the latter approach).\par \par \uc2 OPPONENT'S IDEOLOGY\par \par \uc2 The other major unknown is the identity of the Republican nominee. This year it could make an unusually large amount of difference. In recent polls against Mitt Romney, Obama's lead is just 1 percentage point -- but he leads Herman Cain by 8, Rick Perry by 11 and Michele Bachmann by 14.\par \par \uc2 At some point early next summer, head-to-head polls like these will become the most important predictors of the November result. But this far out they can be misleading and inaccurate. In a survey conducted in late September 1983, Ronald Reagan actually trailed Walter Mondale by 2 points, and in October 1991, George H. W. Bush led Bill Clinton 55 to 20.\par \par \uc2 In this case, though, the relative standing of the Republican opponents against Obama aligns neatly with their perceived ideology. Obama does worse against more moderate candidates like Romney -- and better against staunch conservatives like Perry and Cain.\par \par \uc2 Political scientists have long debated between two theoretical constructs of how Americans vote: one might be called the referendum model, and the other might be called the median voter model. In the referendum model, only the performance of the incumbent party's candidate matters: the opponents could nominate Lyndon H. LaRouche or Jesus H. Christ, and it wouldn't make much difference. In the median voter model, it is only the ideological positioning of the candidates that matters, and presidents are not evaluated on performance at all. As long as Jimmy Carter's political positions were closer to the center of the electorate than Ronald Reagan's (they probably were in 1980), who cared about an inflation rate of 12 percent or the hostage crisis in Iran?\par \par \uc2 Each of these models is ridiculous when taken to its logical extreme. But the evidence points on balance toward the referendum model (Carter lost in 1980, for instance). That is why our view of the fundamentals focuses on two performance-based indicators for the incumbent president -- approval ratings and economic growth -- but only one variable related to the opposition candidate.\par \par \uc2 Still, that one variable is an important one. In their book ''The Party Decides,'' the political scientist Marty Cohen and his colleagues estimated the ideological positioning of past opposition-party nominees based on a combination of objective indicators like Congressional voting records and surveys of presidential historians. I have translated Cohen's estimates to a scale that runs from 0 for an extremely moderate nominee to 100 for an extremely liberal or conservative one, with 50 representing the average.\par \par \uc2 Historically, this indicator has had a good deal of predictive power. When the incumbent party faced an opposition candidate with an extremism rating of 50 or higher, it won re-election in six out of eight cases. When it faced one with a rating of 50 or lower, meaning a more moderate nominee, it won just three times out of nine.\par \par \uc2 As with our other metrics, this one can be outweighed when the other fundamentals are not aligned with it. The moderate Thomas E. Dewey (who scored an 18) lost not once but twice. The very conservative Reagan (who came in at 85) won in 1980 because voters could find too few positives in Jimmy Carter's record. Electability exists along a spectrum and not in absolutes.\par \par \uc2 Still, if the performance-based factors are unkind to Obama, this one is potentially more favorable. I have estimated extremism scores for this year's Republican candidates by combining data from the three principal objective methods that are used to estimate ideology, one based on Congressional voting, one based on fund-raising contributions and the other based on voters' assessments of the candidates' ideology in polls. I then placed the Republicans onto the scale based on how their figures compared with past candidates. Here's how they stacked up:\par \par \uc2 Jon Huntsman 40\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney 49\par \par \uc2 Herman Cain 60\par \par \uc2 Gary Johnson 63\par \par \uc2 Rick Santorum 64\par \par \uc2 Rick Perry 67\par \par \uc2 Newt Gingrich 68\par \par \uc2 Michele Bachmann 83\par \par \uc2 Ron Paul 96\par \par \uc2 As you can see, Romney's score of 49 is to the left of every Republican candidate except for Huntsman. But the G.O.P. as a whole has moved to the right, so Romney is about average in the broader scope of history.\par \par \uc2 The bigger problem for Republicans might come if they nominate a candidate further to Romney's right, like Perry, who has an extremism score of 67. The difference between Romney and Perry amounts to about 4 percentage points at the ballot booth. If conditions were otherwise very favorable (or very unfavorable) to Republicans, this wouldn't be enough to matter: an election that Romney would win by 10 points, Perry might win by 6. But an election that Romney might win by just 2 or 3 points, Perry could easily lose.\par \par \uc2 A THREE-FACTOR MODEL\par \par \uc2 By combining these factors -- approval ratings in the year before the election, G.D.P. growth during the election year itself and the ideology score of the opposition candidate -- we can come up with a forecast of next year's election. By design, it is not an exceptionally precise forecast. There are all types of factors that the model does not explicitly consider, among them the possibility of third-party candidates or differences between the popular vote and the Electoral College. Moreover, voter perceptions about the economy, or the ideological positioning of the candidates, may differ in practice from what the objective data say about them. Rather than pretending to have all the answers, the model knows how much it doesn't know and allows for a reasonably wide range of possible outcomes.\par \par \uc2 The model's error can be reduced, however, if we are willing to consider certain possibilities that fill in some of the blanks. We will evaluate four such scenarios here. They represent cases in which Obama is matched up against either a relatively moderate nominee like Romney or a more conservative one like Perry (who will be used as our guinea pig despite Herman Cain's recent rise in the polls). Further, they represent cases in which the economy either slips into recession or instead beats expectations and grows by 4 percent next year (each has about a one-in-three chance of happening). A multitude of other situations are possible -- but these are the paradigmatic cases. And they produce vastly different results.\par \par \uc2 CASE STUDY NO. 1: ROMNEY AND STAGNANT ECONOMY\par \par \uc2 Obama approval rating in November 2011: 43%\par \par \uc2 G.D.P. growth in 2012: 0%\par \par \uc2 Probability of winning the popular vote: Romney: 83%, Obama: 17%\par \par \uc2 We begin with the worst of these situations for Obama: Mitt Romney is the Republican nominee, and economic growth, rather than continuing along sluggishly, comes to a halt (perhaps the debt dominoes have fallen in Europe). Under these assumptions, Obama would only have a 17 percent chance -- about one in six -- of winning a majority of the popular vote.\par \par \uc2 His chances are slim enough in this case that if I woke up next November to discover that we would have four more years of Obama, I might ask whether there was some sort of October surprise: ''Mitt in Torrid Affair With Filipina Housekeeper.'' Subhead: ''\uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Got Free Romneycare.'' Then I might ask if Sarah Palin had run on the Tea Party ballot line and taken 6 percent of the vote.\par \par \uc2 In a more normal election, an Obama victory would have resulted from some combination of three factors. The first two are arguments that we might expect to see as part of Obama's campaign, and which are viable even under this worst-case scenario. The third is simply an observation.\par \par \uc2 First, Obama may have some untapped potential in highlighting his foreign-policy wins. The killing of Osama bin Laden did not produce a lasting bounce in the polls. But -- sorry to be so gauche -- killing the world's most wanted terrorist will make for a nice sound bite. Meanwhile, the NATO intervention in Libya reached a successful if bloody outcome, and the troops are coming home from Iraq. The White House has not done a good job of turning the discussion to foreign policy, and it has to be careful that in doing so it does not appear to be ignoring the economy. But foreign policy matters to voters, and Obama will have a marketing budget of hundreds of millions of dollars to get the message right.\par \par \uc2 Second, the overall unpopularity of the Republican Party could rub off on Romney, who will have to endorse most of its platform. Only 35 or 40 percent of voters take a favorable view of the G.O.P., which has not improved at all from 2006 or 2008. The Republicans in Congress are less popular still and have an agenda with some prickly bits -- like Paul Ryan's plans to privatize Social Security -- that Romney could have a hard time distancing himself from.\par \par \uc2 All of this, probably, would not be enough to save Obama. Romney is a skilled debater, a cautious candidate and a smart man -- exactly what you want when the fundamentals otherwise favor you. Under these conditions, in fact, Obama would be as likely to lose by double digits as to win the popular vote.\par \par \uc2 Still, the White House would be able to make some credible arguments and Obama might have an outside chance at an upset. But how does it get around the problem of the economy?\par \par \uc2 The observation: even if the economy goes into recession again, voters might not care much about the difference between slow growth and no growth. Some 80 percent of voters already think we're in a recession. They are not happy about it, but expectations are so low that a sort of fatigue may have set in about further bad news.\par \par \uc2 In practice, voters may think about the economy as falling into one of three basic categories -- Good, Bad and Getting Better -- rather than along a continuum. Obama would benefit if he could make a credible case for Getting Better, something he would not be able to do in this situation. But since he's already unable to make that case now -- remember ''Recovery Summer''? -- it's plausible that a deterioration in the numbers would not hurt him as much as an acceleration of growth might help him. Beating Romney with 0 percent growth would not be easy, but it might not be that much more difficult than beating him with 2 percent growth (also no piece of cake, of course).\par \par \uc2 CASE STUDY NO. 2: ROMNEY AND IMPROVING ECONOMY\par \par \uc2 Obama approval rating in November 2011: 43%\par \par \uc2 G.D.P. growth in 2012: 4%\par \par \uc2 Probability of winning the popular vote: Romney: 40%, Obama: 60%\par \par \uc2 Obama would be far better off if he could make the Getting Better case. Imagine, as before, that Romney is the nominee. But rather than going into recession, the economy grows by 4 percent next year, enough to make a real dent in the unemployment rate. This would be enough to make Obama the favorite.\par \par \uc2 But not by all that much: he'd have only about a 60/40 edge.\par \par \uc2 Why not larger? The key to understanding this one is that Obama has a lot of gravity to overcome. Voters usually put their earlier concerns aside if there is an improvement in the economic fundamentals in the election year. But there have been exceptions: growth was quite strong in 1992, but voters were still punishing George H. W. Bush for the 1990-91 recession and the jobless recovery it produced.\par \par \uc2 Romney is much different stylistically from Bush's opponent, Bill Clinton, but both are skilled at driving an economic message. Romney would bring out his PowerPoint and seek to persuade voters that the growth had been too little and too late. After all, if killing bin Laden couldn't lift Obama's approval rating much above 50 percent, who knows whether one year of good-but-not-great growth would?\par \par \uc2 Still, the most likely eventuality in this case -- enough economic growth that the White House gets to make the Getting Better case while maintaining a straight face -- is a narrow win for Obama. Perhaps it would be somewhat like the one that George W. Bush secured in 2004: it would keep the network anchors up late, but it wouldn't be close enough to put us in Recount Land.\par \par \uc2 CASE STUDY NO. 3: PERRY AND IMPROVING ECONOMY\par \par \uc2 Obama approval rating in November 2011: 43%\par \par \uc2 G.D.P. growth in 2012: 4.0%\par \par \uc2 Probability of winning the popular vote: Perry: 17%, Obama: 83%\par \par \uc2 Imagine Rick Perry as the Republican nominee instead, and Obama has considerably more margin for error. Against Perry, should economic growth improve to 4 percent next year, Obama would be about an 83 percent favorite. This is the most favorable arrangement for Obama -- good enough that you might even hear talk about Obama expanding the map again (can he win Georgia? Arizona?).\par \par \uc2 The usual danger to the favorite in these cases is complacency, something that befell Gore in 2000 and Dewey in 1948. Perry, if he wouldn't go over well in high-income and socially liberal states like Colorado or Virginia, could make a credible-enough case about his working-class roots and his jobs record in Texas to appeal to voters in hardscrabble states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. With an improving economy, it would be a narrow path to victory, especially given that Florida -- where Perry's position on Social Security would not play well -- might be a difficult sale for him.\par \par \uc2 But Obama could still go down if he appeared out of touch. This particularly holds if he were too quick to declare ''mission accomplished'' on the economy, or if the Democratic base remained as disinterested in the election as it was in 2010. No one should mistake the Occupy protests, on Wall Street and elsewhere, for a movement of the Democratic base (one poll found that most of the Wall Street protesters identify as independent). But you sometimes get the sense that the left has already gotten over Obama and is focusing on longer-term problems. This may be good for them, but it isn't necessarily good for Obama.\par \par \uc2 And then there is the October surprise potential: ''Obama Sent Crotch Pics to Congressional Staffer.'' Subhead: ''Who Used to Be Lobbyist for Solyndra.''\par \par \uc2 CASE STUDY NO. 4: PERRY AND STAGNANT ECONOMY\par \par \uc2 Obama approval rating in November 2011: 43%\par \par \uc2 G.D.P. growth in 2012: 0%\par \par \uc2 Probability of winning the popular vote: Perry: 59%, Obama: 41%\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most interesting case is the one in which Perry (or Cain) is the nominee but the economy gets worse and falls back into recession. This would be a true test of the two political-science perspectives on the election: the referendum paradigm, which would favor Perry, against the median voter paradigm, which would favor Obama.\par \par \uc2 Our model suggests that the referendum paradigm is slightly more likely to win out, as it did under somewhat similar circumstances in 1980. Specifically, it suggests there is about a 60 percent chance that Perry would beat Obama under these conditions, as Reagan beat Carter.\par \par \uc2 True, Rick Perry is no Ronald Reagan. While they have some biographical similarities (multiterm governors of major states; movie-star good looks; former Democrats) and some ideological similarities, Perry is much more likely to make the mistake of turning the race into a popularity contest rather than asking voters, as Reagan did, whether they were better off than they had been four years earlier. But Reagan won by 10 points, which means that even if Perry has disadvantages relative to Reagan (and Obama has advantages relative to Carter), they might not be enough to overcome the weight of a sagging economy.\par \par \uc2 So Perry would be a favorite under these conditions -- but only a modest one. Republican strategists like Karl Rove are sensible in their desire not to nominate him; he might provide the clearest case in American history of a party blowing an election it by all rights should have won.\par \par \uc2 THE BOTTOM LINE\par \par \uc2 Average these four scenarios together and the probabilities come out to almost exactly 50-50. A month or two ago, when Perry and Romney appeared about equally likely to be the Republican nominee, it would therefore have been proper to think of the election as a toss-up.\par \par \uc2 With Perry having slumped in the polls, however, and Romney the more likely nominee, the odds tilt slightly toward Obama joining the list of one-termers. It is early, and almost no matter what, the election will be a losable one for Republicans. But Obama's position is tenuous enough that it might not be a winnable one for him.\par \par \uc2 INTERACTIVE MODELING: Predict Obama's chances yourself at nytimes.com/magazine.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY JIM WATSON/AFP/GETTY IMAGES)(MM33); HUNTSMAN (PHOTOGRAPH BY TONI SANDYS, POOL); ROMNEY (PHOTOGRAPH BY SCOTT AUDETTE/REUTERS); CAIN (PHOTOGRAPH BY STEPHEN MORTON/GETTY IMAGES); PERRY (PHOTOGRAPH BY SCOTT AUDETTE/REUTERS); BACHMANN (PHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREW HARRER/BLOOMBERG NEWS) (MM34)\par \par \uc2 DRAWINGS (DRAWINGS BY MICHAEL FREIMUTH) (MM32;MM33;MM34; MM37); CHARTS: HEAD-TO-HEAD: Percentages represent Obama's chances of winning the popular vote versus different challengers in various economic situations.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Last week about 20 students sat in Room 466 at Galileo Academy of Science and Technology, writing down all the ways that people abuse one another. Rapes and beatings topped the lists. One boy asked, ''What if you just have someone tell you you're not going to get far in life?''\par \par \uc2 The exercise was part of a daylong effort to help students understand how typical teen-age stress over grades, prom and heartache can become paralyzing amid larger issues like violent relationships, broken homes and illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Galileo, a public high school in the Marina district, devoted 28 class periods to workshops on emotional health, and the staff of the school's Wellness Center turned Galileo's quad into an outreach event featuring music, games and prizes.\par \par \uc2 More than a third of Galileo's 2,200 students sought help from the center last year for depression, anger, anxiety, substance abuse, grief, trauma, and physical and sexual health. During a given week, 300 to 400 Galileo students receive individual or group services, from counseling to clinic appointments.\par \par \uc2 Over the last decade, the San Francisco Unified School District has built a pioneering support network to help teenagers escape the private suffering of adolescence that erases the line between nurturing emotional health and providing an education.\par \par \uc2 ''They'll come with their stress, not ready to work on math,'' said Jessica Stein Colvin, Galileo's wellness coordinator, ''and we try to prepare them to face the day.''\par \par \uc2 In a recent districtwide survey of teachers who had referred students to Wellness Centers, three-quarters reported greater academic success. Eighty-six percent said they noticed that the students had improved emotional well-being.\par \par \uc2 The demand for services is growing throughout the district. Wellness Centers at 15 of San Francisco's high schools served more than 7,000 students last year, almost half the public high school population. Counting repeat visits, the Galileo Wellness Center handled more than 17,000 drop-ins.\par \par \uc2 ''Our No. 1 need is more mental health clinicians,'' Ms. Colvin said. ''There is mental health therapy happening here all the time. Every single clinical space is used every hour of the day.''\par \par \uc2 Rahsaan, a 17-year-old a senior at Galileo, broke up with his girlfriend last year. He is estranged from his parents and siblings -- he has lived in the Bayview district with his disabled grandfather, whom he has cared for for more than 10 years.\par \par \uc2 Last semester, he said, his grades plummeted when he hit an emotional wall.\par \par \uc2 ''I was outside and one of the teachers saw me crying and they brought me down here,'' Rahsaan said. ''Jessica and the other teacher stayed here after school to make sure I wasn't going to harm myself or anything. It helped me a lot because I was, like, literally going to kick somebody's ass and not care about the consequences.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Colvin connected Rahsaan with a 24-hour support program in his neighborhood. This year, he has been dropping into the Wellness Center almost every day to relax or talk about things on his mind.\par \par \uc2 ''We want them to understand, 'I have these feelings but I'm safe,' '' Ms. Colvin said. '' 'But if something big happens in my life, I know where to go.' ''\par \par \uc2 The San Francisco Wellness Initiative is a joint project of the district and the city's Department of Children, Youth and their Families, and the Department of Public Health. The centers were created in the wake of the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, as schools around the country focused resources on campus security and troubled youths.\par \par \uc2 Kevin Gogin, program director of the district's School Health Programs, said the schools saw a greater opportunity.\par \par \uc2 ''We took an approach that was particular to random acts of violence and decided to go broad and provide a spectrum of services so we could reach as many students as possible,'' Mr. Gogin said.\par \par \uc2 Michael Baxter, director of youth programs for the Department of Public Health, said the wellness teams had found success through their integration into the schools and innovative approaches to reaching students.\par \par \uc2 ''They're always looking for what's out there, what kind of services have evidence behind them and are worthwhile interventions,'' Mr. Baxter said.\par \par \uc2 A growing number of students seeking help are immigrants or refugees. A third of Galileo's students were born outside the United States. Some carry the secret of their \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  parents. Others are separated from relatives or are cared for by a changing roster of family members who move in and out of the country.\par \par \uc2 ''Grief and loss is huge,'' said Ulash Dunlap, a therapist at Galileo. ''Even students who have been here for five years -- that loss takes a long time to settle.''\par \par \uc2 In a 2010 district survey of students who had participated in wellness programs, 81 percent reported coming to school more often as a result; 69 percent reported academic improvement. Ninety percent said there was an adult in the Wellness Center who cared about them.\par \par \uc2 Vilma, Rashon and Michelle, all 17-year-old seniors, attend a girls' group through the Wellness Center each week with about a dozen other students.\par \par \uc2 ''Everybody's basically being open and they feel comfortable enough to share stuff that they wouldn't normally share if we were walking down the hallway,'' Rashon said.\par \par \uc2 Vilma and Michelle used to skip a lot of classes to party or hang out at the movies all day. Their grade point averages dropped below 2.0.\par \par \uc2 ''All we wanted to do was go out, have fun, smoke, drink, not go to school,'' Vilma said. ''Because of the fun we had then, right now we're going to night school.''\par \par \uc2 Aside from school, Vilma is also stressed about her boyfriend, who is 18 and was recently arrested. ''I really care about him,'' she said. ''He's not a kid anymore. He's not going to juvie, he's going to county.''\par \par \uc2 The workshops and events at Galileo last week were the school's biggest push yet to destigmatize emotional health issues. During third period, 40 students gathered in the library to talk about stress. Casey Gold, the Wellness Center's community health outreach worker, asked, ''How many of you have felt stress before?'' Thirty hands shot up.\par \par \uc2 Patrick Delaney, the school librarian, watched from the back of the room.\par \par \uc2 ''Libraries are places where quiet kids generally gravitate,'' Mr. Delaney said, ''but quiet doesn't necessarily mean happy or contented or at peace. One of the things I'm seeing a lot of that I did not see as much before is depression. One kid came to me and said, 'Everything is flat. I feel like I'm carrying a backpack full of rocks.' ''\par \par \uc2 During a lunch break, music blared on the quad as students played carnival games and won prizes for answering questions on emotional health. As the bell announced the end of lunch, 14-year-old Brandon Wilson bounded through a crowd of students, landed in front of a spin-the-wheel game and asked a woman, ''Can I play one last time?''\par \par \uc2 He spun the wheel, which stopped on the words, ''Signs of stress.'' The woman told him to name three. Bouncing on his toes, he said, ''Keeping to yourself, low self-esteem, starting to go crazy.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Students at Galileo Academy of Science and Technology in San Francisco used chalk to express their feelings last week during an emotional health workshop.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A judge found an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Bolivia guilty of murder on Monday in a car crash that killed a Benedictine nun. Prosecutors said the immigrant, Carlos Martinelly Montano, was drunk and caused the crash in Bristow that killed Sister Denise Mosier and injured two other nuns. The judge ruled that driving under the influence has consequences that are foreseeable and therefore meet the standard for murder. Before the trial, Mr. Martinelly Montano pleaded guilty to lesser charges, including involuntary manslaughter. But his lawyers strongly disputed the murder charge, and he pleaded not guilty.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020111101e7b10005x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Today, Republican candidates are competing over who can talk the toughest about illegal immigration -- who will erect the most impenetrable border defense; who will turn off ''magnets'' like college tuition benefits.\par \par \uc2 But after such pointed proposals heated up yet another Republican debate, on Tuesday night, some party officials see a yellow light signaling danger in battleground states with large Hispanic populations in November 2012. Will Hispanic voters remember and punish the eventual Republican nominee?\par \par \uc2 ''The discussion of creating electrified fences from sea to sea is neither prudent nor helpful,'' said Ryan Call, chairman of the Republican Party of Colorado, where Hispanics cast 13 percent of votes in 2008 and helped President Obama flip the state to blue. ''They're throwing red meat around in an attempt to mollify a particular aspect of the Republican base.''\par \par \uc2 Besides Colorado, Mr. Obama cemented his victory in part by carrying three other swing states with large Hispanic voting populations: Florida, Nevada and New Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Republican strategists have hoped to win many of these voters back by appealing to their discontent over the economy and to their social conservatism, issues that helped George W. Bush win a historically high 44 percent of Hispanic voters in 2004.\par \par \uc2 Now, however, that pitch may be thwarted, according to some Republican strategists.\par \par \uc2 Both Herman Cain, the former business executive, and Representative Michele Bachmann are proposing a 1,200-mile border fence -- electrified, in Mr. Cain's case, double-walled in Mrs. Bachmann's.\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney has attacked Gov. Rick Perry of Texas as soft on illegal immigration. Mr. Perry punched back in the debate on Tuesday in Las Vegas, accusing Mr. Romney of ''hypocrisy'' because, Mr. Perry said, ''you had illegals working on your property.''\par \par \uc2 Robert Ramirez, a Republican state representative from Colorado who attended the debate, said Hispanic voters in his state ''are sick and tired of empty promises from the Democratic Party.''\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, Mr. Ramirez was concerned about the nominees' lack of sensitivity. ''We can't pretend the Latino vote doesn't exist,'' he said. ''It's time we became the party of inclusion.''\par \par \uc2 Even Mr. Romney, who has been more measured in his remarks, may have lost Hispanic support over his criticism of a Texas law that allows some children of illegal immigrants to attend state colleges on in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 ''He can make as many trips to Florida and New Mexico and Colorado and other swing states that have a large Latino population, but he can write off the Latino vote,'' said Lionel Sosa, a strategist in Texas who advised Mr. Bush and Senator John McCain on appealing to Hispanics. ''He's not going to gain it again.''\par \par \uc2 In each of those states, plus Nevada, Hispanics are a growing share of eligible voters, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Although these voters have traditionally favored Democrats, Mr. Obama's 67 percent share of the Hispanic vote in 2008 dipped to 60 percent who voted Democratic during the 2010 Republican wave that swept the midterm elections, said Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew center.\par \par \uc2 In a Pew survey that year, Hispanic voters ranked education and the economy as their top issues. But there was strong support for state-level ''Dream'' acts allowing children of illegal immigrants to attend colleges on in-state tuition, and 61 percent disapproved of more border fencing.\par \par \uc2 Many analysts credit the Democratic victories that year of Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado to get-out-the-vote efforts by Latinos.\par \par \uc2 ''Sharron Angle got destroyed in the election because of her anti-immigration stand,'' said Andres Ramirez, a Democratic strategist in Nevada, referring to Mr. Reid's opponent, a Tea Party darling. Mr. Ramirez predicted that Hispanic participation in the 2012 election in Nevada would surpass the 15 percent from 2008, and he said that Republicans missed an opportunity in holding a debate in Las Vegas to showcase more moderate immigration views.\par \par \uc2 ''Their rhetoric on illegal immigration was very over the top,'' he said. ''It will cost them in the future.''\par \par \uc2 Heidi Smith, the Republican national committeewoman from Nevada, said the focus on illegal immigration was a distraction. ''It's taking time off of the big issue, and that is we don't have any jobs,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 In Florida, where the Hispanic vote has traditionally leaned Republican because of large numbers of conservative Cuban-Americans, immigration issues may be especially divisive in 2012. The state's favorite son Republican senator, Marco Rubio, seems only too happy to duck immigration issues, and the Republican-controlled State Senate refused to pass a bill this spring with a tough requirement on employers to check workers' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Joe Gruters, chairman of the Republican Party of Sarasota County in Florida, said that showing toughness against illegal immigration was an ''electrifying'' issue and could bump a Republican candidate many points in primary polls. He is disappointed by the moderation of candidates' proposals so far. ''Nobody said, 'We have to repeal the 14th Amendment,' '' he said, referring to the constitutional guarantee of citizenship to a child born in the United States. Critics of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  mothers who supposedly enter the country to have ''anchor babies'' sometimes propose repealing the Reconstruction-era amendment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gruters was quick to concede that such positions would cost an eventual Republican nominee.\par \par \uc2 ''In case they're the nominee, it could be a deal-breaker where they take themselves out as a serious contender,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Migrant workers harvested organic parsley this month in Wellington, Colo.

\par\par \uc2 CHECK POINT\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc4}{\*\bkmkend toc4}\b \uc2 Romney's Lawn Care and the Fight Over Immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON, BINYAMIN APPELBAUM and TRIP GABRIEL   \par \uc2 852 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Rick Perry's most pointed attack against Mitt Romney in Tuesday night's debate concerned an immigration matter that came to light when Mr. Romney was campaigning for president four years ago.\par \par \uc2 ''You hired illegals in your home,'' said Mr. Perry, the governor of Texas, ''and you knew for -- about it for a year.'' For Mr. Romney to say he was tough on illegal immigration was ''the height of hypocrisy,'' Mr. Perry said.\par \par \uc2 While it is not clear that Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, ever knew directly that his landscaping company was using illegal immigrants to tend his lawn, the episode was embarrassing for him in 2007 when it happened, and it is awkward now.\par \par \uc2 The Boston Globe first reported in December 2006 that Mr. Romney was employing a lawn care company that regularly hired illegal immigrants. He said he had dismissed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  he discovered working on his property. But he continued to use the same lawn company, and a year later The Globe reported that the company had once again employed illegal immigrants for lawn care. The day of the second Globe report, Mr. Romney fired the company.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romney said that he had continued to use the company because it had guaranteed that it would not hire any illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 At the debate, Mr. Romney said he would combat illegal immigration by adopting a nationwide electronic program to verify the immigration status of all new workers. And he fired back at Mr. Perry, saying, ''I don't think I've ever hired an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in my life.''\par \par \uc2 Cain's Tax Math\par \par \uc2 At the start of the debate, Herman Cain said his much-discussed ''9-9-9'' plan ''does not raise taxes on those that are making the least. It's simply not true.''\par \par \uc2 But a growing number of independent analysts have concluded that it does.\par \par \uc2 The plan calls for deep cuts in the existing federal taxes on individual and corporate income, both of which would be reduced to a flat 9 percent from a system of tiered rates that run above 30 percent for the highest earners. Mr. Cain then proposes the addition of a 9 percent sales tax.\par \par \uc2 Analysts say Mr. Cain's plan would raise taxes for lower-income families and reduce the taxes paid by higher-income families.\par \par \uc2 ''Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan is a terrific example of fiscal hocus-pocus,'' Edward D. Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California, writes in a coming analysis of the plan for the trade journal Tax Notes. ''It is presented as a low-tax panacea, but it actually would raise the tax bills of many Americans very substantially.''\par \par \uc2 Professor Kleinbard estimated that a family with $120,000 in income last year would have paid $541 less in federal taxes under Mr. Cain's plan. A family that earned $50,000, by contrast, would have paid $4,800 more.\par \par \uc2 The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institute, concluded that the plan amounted to a 25.38 percent national sales tax. Flat sales taxes fall more heavily on lower-income families, siphoning off a much larger share of their total income.\par \par \uc2 It is also important to note that the 9-9-9 plan is only a transitional stage in Mr. Cain's broader plan to overhaul federal taxation. He has proposed the ultimate elimination of income taxes in favor of a flat 30 percent sales tax.\par \par \uc2 Border Fence Costs\par \par \uc2 Is it possible to build a fence along the 2,000-mile United States-Mexico border? If so, is it worth the cost? And would it effectively secure the border?\par \par \uc2 Most of the candidates are competing to outdo one another in their support for building a fence on, as Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has put it, ''every mile, every foot, every inch'' of the border. Mr. Cain has called for an electrified barrier that could kill people, a statement he later said was in jest, then later still said he had meant.\par \par \uc2 Only Mr. Perry, whose state's border with Mexico is 1,200 miles long, disagrees about the sense of a fence along every mile, without conceding his commitment to security.\par \par \uc2 It would take 10 to 15 years and cost $30 billion to complete a fence, Mr. Perry said on Tuesday night. He argued that a more cost-effective approach would be to build one in high-traffic areas and to use ''boots on the ground'' and Predator drones to monitor other areas. ''That is the way to shut that border down,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Homeland Security agrees with Mr. Perry. Officials say that a fence is prohibitively expensive and inefficient, given that many stretches of the border are remote. The agency has completed about 650 miles of fence, mostly in cities and at points where illegal crossings are frequent.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- A federal appeals court in Atlanta temporarily blocked two provisions of Alabama's far-reaching immigration enforcement law on Friday, but left much of it in effect as the state and the United States Justice Department continued to fight over the law in the courts.\par \par \uc2 The United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued a preliminary injunction against a section of the law that requires schools to determine the immigration status of children who are enrolling, as well as the status of their parents. It also blocked a section making it a state crime for illegal immigrants not to carry registration documents.\par \par \uc2 The law, considered the toughest state immigration law in the nation, was signed by Gov. Robert Bentley in June, but it was challenged shortly thereafter in lawsuits by the Justice Department, a coalition of civil rights groups and others.\par \par \uc2 On Sept 28, a federal district judge in Alabama issued an injunction against several provisions but allowed most of the law to take effect while the challenges made their way through the courts.\par \par \uc2 The 11th Circuit court has expedited the appeals process and is scheduled to hear arguments within the next two months. The Justice Department asked for a stay of certain provisions pending the outcome of the appeal.\par \par \uc2 Among the sections of the law that the court let stand is one requiring the police to determine the immigration status of someone who has been arrested or pulled over in a traffic stop if ''reasonable suspicion'' exists that the person is in the country illegally. The court also declined to block a provision rendering most contracts with illegal immigrants unenforceable and a section making it a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to conduct a ''business transaction,'' like renewing a driver's license, with any governmental body in the state.\par \par \uc2 The provision pertaining to schools applies only to children who are enrolling for the first time, not to anyone already enrolled in school, so the number of students actually affected by the new procedure would have been minimal. Nevertheless, in the two weeks that the provision was in effect, attendance figures varied widely, with absences among Hispanic students going as high as 5,300 and, on Thursday, back to around 1,200, which is near normal. School superintendents appeared on television and at meetings urging parents to keep their children in school and telling them that the provision would not apply to them or their children.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after Friday's ruling was announced, the interim state superintendent, Larry E. Craven, issued a statement directing schools to stop trying to ascertain the country of birth during enrollment.\par \par \uc2 ''Schools will revert to enrollment procedures in effect prior to September 29,'' the statement read.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: An immigration law affected attendance at schools like Valley Elementary School in Pelham, Ala.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Metropolitan's cover article last week, by John Leland, told of a 58-year-old, uninsured \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Hong Kong who spent 19 months in New York Downtown Hospital after suffering a stroke, because his family would not take him. Outrage over his long stay -- and its $1.4 million cost, largely unpaid -- erupted in more than 230 reader comments on NYTimes.com; below is a sampling. Readers also wrote about Ginia Bellafante's Big City column, which criticized the New York Police Department's response to Occupy Wall Street and some earlier protests.\par \par \uc2 I've worked in many hospitals in the region, and this is an astoundingly common problem. Each state has its own laws. Whereas in NYC, an undocumented, uninsured individual is able to get dialysis covered, this is not true in New Jersey, and one cannot get discharged without a dialysis center accepting them. I have seen young men sitting in hospital beds for months and even years, while social work figures out how to get them placed. It's heartbreaking to see these people trapped in the hospital.\par \par \uc2 It's equally heartbreaking to realize that hospitals in the region, already facing severe budget shortfalls, are burdened with patients that they cannot discharge.\par \par \uc2 To put it in perspective, in an area with a recent hospital closure (St. Vincent's), $1.4 million could buy 11 family practitioners or pediatricians, 18 nurses, 22 physical therapists or LPNs. It could pay for vaccination outreach programs, and restore 10 percent of the budget for pre-natal care for undocumented workers. Just 1 percent of the money could have been used to have in-house physical therapy and rehabilitation.\par \par \uc2 Instead, it was spent keeping a person, who didn't want to be there, in a hospital.\par \par \uc2 Tim,\par \par \uc2 NYC\par \par \uc2 Why are we supposed to feel sympathy for this man? He's broken our immigration laws for over two decades. He hasn't learn the English language well. He's not an undocumented immigrant. He's an illegal alien. We let in hundreds of thousands of people legally each year. If you can't come here legally, don't come at all. Ship him back to his country and be done with it. We are not the world's hospital.\par \par \uc2 ordinary person,\par \par \uc2 America\par \par \uc2 In this case it's somewhat immaterial that this man is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The story would be the same, I think, if he were a poor or homeless person with no relatives. This is a good illustration of the extraordinarily high cost to all of us of two things: (1) paying people wages so low that they cannot live on their income, much less afford health insurance, and (2) not having a national health care system where everyone is covered, and continuing to have health care as a for-profit industry.\par \par \uc2 Oakbranch,\par \par \uc2 California\par \par \uc2 The most absurd fact in this report is that a hospital bed costs $2,000 a day -- and for someone in reasonably good health! How in God's name does that make any sense?\par \par \uc2 John H.,\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 Costs cited by hospitals are accounting fantasies. They simply divide the total costs into the number of patients; this includes huge salaries made by upper level staff/administration. Hospitals also bill extremely high for low-cost items and for brief visits which cost virtually nothing. Hospitals, even nonprofit ones, are cash cows for those who run them.\par \par \uc2 C,\par \par \uc2 NYC\par \par \uc2 Nixon and Bloomberg\par \par \uc2 When the federal govt. was confronted on Nov 20, 1969, with the ''takeover'' of Alcatraz Island by Native Americans, the White House first considered going in after them (79 men, women and children) and pulling them out. Cooler heads pointed out that the P.R. for that kind of rough extirpation would be horrible. It was decided to let them stay and even help them with basic necessities. Things cooled down, and the Indians were eventually and quietly removed -- but much later and after their grievances had been seriously addressed. Nixon's people did that. Why can't Bloomberg and his people?\par \par \uc2 Martin L Schneider,\par \par \uc2 Brooklyn Heights, NY\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY EMILY BERL FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020111009e7a9000a8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBERTVILLE, Ala. -- The vanishing began Wednesday night, the most frightened families packing up their cars as soon as they heard the news.\par \par \uc2 They left behind mobile homes, sold fully furnished for a thousand dollars or even less. Or they just closed up and, in a gesture of optimism, left the keys with a neighbor. Dogs were fed one last time; if no home could be found, they were simply unleashed.\par \par \uc2 Two, 5, 10 years of living here, and then gone in a matter of days, to Tennessee, Illinois, Oregon, Florida, Arkansas, Mexico -- who knows? Anywhere but Alabama.\par \par \uc2 The exodus of Hispanic immigrants began just hours after a federal judge in Birmingham upheld most provisions of the state's far-reaching immigration enforcement law.\par \par \uc2 The judge, Sharon Lovelace Blackburn, upheld the parts of the law allowing state and local police to ask for immigration papers during routine traffic stops, rendering most contracts with illegal immigrants unenforceable and requiring schools to ascertain the immigration status of children at registration time.\par \par \uc2 When Judge Blackburn was finished, Alabama was left with what the governor called ''the strongest immigration law in this country.'' It went into effect immediately, though her ruling is being appealed by the Justice Department and a coalition of civil rights groups.\par \par \uc2 In the days since, school superintendents have reassured parents -- one even did so on television in Spanish -- that nothing had changed for children who were already enrolled. Wary police departments around the state said they were, for now, awaiting instructions on how to carry out the law.\par \par \uc2 For many immigrants, however, waiting seemed just too dangerous. By Monday afternoon, 123 students had withdrawn from the schools in this small town in the northern hills, leaving behind teary and confused classmates. Scores more were absent. Statewide, 1,988 Hispanic students were absent on Friday, about 5 percent of the entire Hispanic population of the school system.\par \par \uc2 John Weathers, an Albertville businessman who rents and has sold houses to many Hispanic residents, said his occupancy had suddenly dropped by a quarter and might drop further, depending on what happens in the next week. Two people who had paid off their mortgages called him asking if they could sell back their homes, Mr. Weathers said.\par \par \uc2 Grocery stores and restaurants were noticeably less busy, which in some cases may be just as well, because some employees stopped showing up. In certain neighborhoods the streets are uncommonly quiet, like the aftermath of some sort of rapture.\par \par \uc2 Drawn by work in the numerous poultry processing plants, Hispanic immigrants have been coming to Albertville for years, long enough ago that some of the older ones gained amnesty under the immigration law of 1986. But the influx picked up over the last decade, and the signs on Main Street are now mostly bilingual, when they include English at all.\par \par \uc2 What the new immigration law means on a large scale will become clearest in a place like Albertville, whether it will deliver jobs to citizens and protect taxpayers as promised or whether it will spell economic disaster as opponents fear.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the law, particularly farmers, contractors and home builders, say the measure has already been devastating, leaving rotting crops in fields and critical shortages of labor. They say that even fully documented Hispanic workers are leaving, an assessment that seems to be borne out in interviews here. The legal status of family members is often mixed -- children are often American-born citizens -- but the decision whether to stay rests on the weakest link.\par \par \uc2 Backers of the law acknowledge that it might be disruptive in the short term, but say it will prove effective over time.\par \par \uc2 ''It's going to take some time for the local labor pool to develop again,'' said State Senator Arthur Orr, Republican of Decatur, ''but outside labor shouldn't come in and just beat them every time on cost and put them out of business.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Orr said there were already signs that the law was working, pointing out that the work-release center in Decatur, about 50 miles to the northwest, was not so long ago unable to find jobs for inmates with poultry processors or home manufacturers. Since the law was enacted in June, he said, the center has been placing more and more inmates in these jobs, now more than 150 a day.\par \par \uc2 On Monday morning, one of the poultry processing plants in Albertville had a job fair, attracting an enormous crowd, a mix of Hispanic, black and white job-seekers, lining up outside the plant and down the street.\par \par \uc2 ''This needed to be done years ago,'' Shannon Lolling, 36, who has been unemployed for over a year, said of the law.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lolling's problem seemed to be with the system that had brought the \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  workers here, not with the workers themselves.\par \par \uc2 ''That's why our jobs went south to Mexico,'' he said. ''They pay them less wages and pocket the money, keep us from having jobs.''\par \par \uc2 Not far from the plant, in the Hispanic neighborhoods, it is hard to differentiate the silence of the workday, the silence of abandonment or the silence of paralyzing fear.\par \par \uc2 Many Hispanics have chosen to stay for now, saying, with little apparent conviction, that the law will surely be blocked by the president, the judge, ''the government.'' Until then, they are not leaving their homes unless absolutely necessary. They send others to buy their groceries and tell their children to quit the soccer team and to come home right after school. Rumors of raids and roadblocks are rampant, and though the new law has nothing to say about such things, distrust is primed by anecdotes, like one told by a local Hispanic pastor who said he was pulled over outside Birmingham on Wednesday, within hours of the ruling. His friend who was driving -- and who is in the United States illegally -- is now in jail on an unrelated misdemeanor charge, the pastor said, adding that while he was let go, a policeman told him he was no longer welcome in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 ''I am afraid to drive to church.,'' a 54-year-old poultry plant worker named Candelaria said, adding, ''The lady that gives me a ride to work said she is leaving. She said she felt like a prisoner.''\par \par \uc2 All summer long, Allen Stoner, a lawyer in Decatur, has been helping his Hispanic clients fill out forms appointing friends or family members as guardians of their children, who are in many cases American-born citizens. This way, the children would not be transferred to social services if the parents were arrested and deported.\par \par \uc2 Much of this was done by the time the judge's ruling came down, though last week Mr. Stoner's clients began to contact him immediately to ask what they should be doing. Monday was quiet.\par \par \uc2 ''We had a lot of phone calls Thursday and Friday,'' Mr. Stoner said, ''but it has plummeted.''\par \par \uc2 He did not know for sure, but he figured his clients were gone.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Daniel Herring applied for a job Monday at \uc2 Wayne Farms\uc2  in Albertville.

\par\par \uc2 IMMIGRATION UPENDED THE YO-YO EFFECT\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc8}{\*\bkmkend toc8}\b \uc2 Crossing Over, and Over\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAMIEN CAVE   \par \uc2 2,775 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AGUA PRIETA, Mexico -- ''My wife, my son -- I have to get back to them,'' Daniel kept telling himself, from the moment he was arrested in Seattle for driving with an expired license, all the way through the deportation proceeding that delivered him to Mexico in June.\par \par \uc2 Nothing would deter him from crossing the border again. He had left his hometown at 24, he said. Twelve years later, he spoke nearly fluent English and had an American son, a wife and three brothers in the United States. ''I'll keep trying,'' he said, ''until I'll get there.''\par \par \uc2 This is increasingly the profile of illegal immigration today. Migrant shelters along the Mexican border are filled not with newcomers looking for a better life, but with seasoned crossers: older men and women, often deportees, braving ever-greater risks to get back to their families in the United States -- the country they consider home.\par \par \uc2 They present an enormous challenge to American policy makers, because they continue to head north despite obstacles more severe than at any time in recent history. It is not just that the American economy has little to offer; the border itself is far more threatening. On one side, fences have grown and American agents have multiplied; on the other, criminals haunt the journey at every turn.\par \par \uc2 And yet, while these factors -- and better opportunities at home -- have cut illegal immigration from Mexico to its lowest level in decades, they are not enough to scare off a sizable, determined cadre.\par \par \uc2 ''We have it boiled down to the hardest lot,'' said Christopher Sabatini, senior director for policy at the Council of the Americas.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, 56 percent of apprehensions at the Mexican border in 2010 involved people who had been caught previously, up from 44 percent in 2005. A growing percentage of deportees in recent years have also been deported before, according to Department of Homeland Security figures.\par \par \uc2 For the Obama administration, these repeat offenders have become a high priority. Prosecutions for illegal re-entry have jumped by more than two-thirds since 2008. Officials say it is now the most prosecuted federal felony.\par \par \uc2 President Obama has already deported around 1.1 million immigrants -- more than any president since Dwight D. Eisenhower -- and officials say the numbers will not decline. But at a time when the dynamics of immigration are changing, experts and advocates on all sides are increasingly asking if the approach, which has defined immigration policy since 9/11, still makes sense.\par \par \uc2 Deportation is expensive, costing the government at least $12,500 per person, and it often does not work: between October 2008 and July 22 of this year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement spent $2.25 billion sending back 180,229 people who had been deported before and come back anyway. Many more have returned and stayed hidden.\par \par \uc2 Some groups favoring reduced immigration say that making life harder for illegal immigrants in this country would be far more efficient. They argue that along with eliminating work opportunities by requiring employers to verify the reported immigration status of new hires, Congress should also prohibit illegal immigrants from opening bank accounts, or even obtaining library cards.\par \par \uc2 ''You'd reduce the number of people who keep coming back again and again,'' said Bob Dane, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The alternative, says Doris Meissner, the country's top immigration official in the mid-1990s, is to accept that illegal immigrants like Daniel ''are people with fundamental ties to the United States, not where they came from.''\par \par \uc2 ''Our societies are so deeply connected,'' Ms. Meissner said, referring primarily to the United States and Mexico, the main source of illegal immigrants. ''And that is not reflected at all in policy.''\par \par \uc2 The administration acknowledges that immigrants like Daniel are rooted in the United States and typically have otherwise clean criminal records. But under its new plan introduced in August -- suspending deportations for pending low-priority cases, including immigrants brought to the United States as children -- repeat crossers are singled out for removal alongside ''serious felons,'' ''known gang members'' and ''individuals who pose a clear risk to national security.''\par \par \uc2 Administration officials say they are trying to break the ''yo-yo effect'' of people bouncing back, as mandated by congress when it toughened laws related to illegal re-entry in the 1990s.\par \par \uc2 But some experts argue that this commingling actually undermines security. After a decade of record deportations, critics argue, it has become even harder to separate the two groups that now define the border: professional criminals and experienced migrants motivated by family ties in the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''If you think drug dealers and terrorists are much more dangerous than maids and gardeners, then we should get as many visas as possible to those people, so we can focus on the real threat,'' said David Shirk, director of the Transborder Institute at the University of San Diego. ''Widening the gates would strengthen the walls.''\par \par \uc2 Crime and the Border\par \par \uc2 The border crossers pouring into Arizona a decade or two ago were more numerous, but less likely to be threatening. David Jimarez, a Border Patrol agent with years of experience south of Tucson, recalled that even when migrants outnumbered American authorities by 25 to 1, they did not resist. ''They would just sit down and wait for us,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Over the past few years, the mix has changed, with more drug smugglers and other criminals among the dwindling, but still substantial, ranks of migrants.\par \par \uc2 The impacts are far-reaching. In northern Mexico, less immigration means less business. Border towns like Agua Prieta, long known as a departure point, have gone from bustling to windblown. Taxis that ferried migrants to the mountains now gather dust. Restaurants and hotels, like the sunflower-themed Girasol downtown, are practically empty. On one recent afternoon, only 3 of the 50 rooms were occupied.\par \par \uc2 ''In 2000, we were full every day,'' said Alejandro Rocha, the hotel's manager.\par \par \uc2 New research from the University of California, San Diego, shows that crime is now the top concern for Mexicans thinking of heading north. As fear keeps many migrants home, many experienced border guides, or coyotes, have given up illegal migration for other jobs.\par \par \uc2 In Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, one well-known coyote is now selling tires. In Nogales, the largest Mexican city bordering Arizona, power has shifted to tattooed young men with expensive binoculars along the border fence, while here in Agua Prieta -- where Mexican officials say traffic is one-thirthieth of what it once was -- the only way to get across is to deal with gangs that sometimes push migrants to carry drugs.\par \par \uc2 It is even worse in Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Tex. Just standing at the border fence brings out drug cartel enforcers demanding $300 for the right to pass. Migrants and the organizations that assist them say cartel lieutenants roam the shelters, looking for deportees willing to work as lookouts, earning $400 a week until they have enough to pay for passage north.\par \par \uc2 ''I was thinking about doing it, too,'' said Daniel, looking down. ''But then I thought about my family.''\par \par \uc2 American law enforcement officials say the matrix of drugs, migration and violence has become more visible at the border and along the trails and roads heading north, where more of the immigrants being caught carry drugs or guns -- making them more likely to flee, resist arrest or commit other crimes.\par \par \uc2 ''There's less traffic, but traffic that's there is more threatening,'' Mr. Jimarez, the border agent, said.\par \par \uc2 Larry Dever, the sheriff of Cochise County, Ariz., which sits north of Agua Prieta, agreed: ''The guys smuggling people and narcotics now are more sinister.''\par \par \uc2 His county, 6,169 square miles of scrub brush, ranches and tiny towns in the state's southeast corner, has been an established crossing corridor since the mid-1990s. Since 2008, the police there have tracked every crime linked to illegal immigrants, in part because state and federal officials frequently requested data, treating the county as a bellwether of border security.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, when a Cochise rancher named Robert Krentz was killed in March 2010 after radioing to his brother that he was going to help a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , the county quickly became a flash point for a larger debate that ultimately led to SB 1070, the polarizing Arizona bill giving the police more responsibility for cracking down on illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Yet, crime involving illegal immigrants is relatively rare (5 percent of all local crime, Sheriff Dever said). Mostly it consists of burglaries involving stolen food. And, public records show, in 11 of the 18 violent crimes linked to illegal immigrants over 18 months, immigrants were both the victims and attackers.\par \par \uc2 This is not the portrait given by Republican border governors, including Rick Perry of Texas, a presidential candidate who recently said that ''it is not safe on that border.'' But while Mexican drug cartels have increased their presence from Tucson to New York -- sometimes engaging in brutal violence after entering the country illegally -- Americans living near the border are generally safe.\par \par \uc2 A USA Today analysis of Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California in July found that crime within 100 miles of the border is below both the national average and the average for each of those states -- and has been declining for years. Several other independent researchers have come to the same conclusion.\par \par \uc2 But the border is not safe for people crossing or patrolling it. The number of immigrants found dead in the Arizona desert, from all causes, has failed to decline as fast as illegal immigration has, while assaults on Border Patrol agents grew by 41 percent from 2006 to 2010, almost entirely because of an increase in attacks with rocks. The heightened risks have stimulated a debate: Has the more aggressive approach -- bigger fences, more agents and deportations -- contributed to, or diminished, the danger?\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Dever, lionized as an ''illegal immigration warrior'' by immigration opponents, says that increased enforcement has made Americans safer and should continue until his neighbors tell him they are no longer afraid.\par \par \uc2 But some immigration advocates contend that the government's approach is too broad to be effective. ''We have to really separate out the guy who is coming to make a living with his family from the terrorist or the drug dealer,'' said Peter Siavelis, an editor of ''Getting Immigration Right: What Every American Needs to Know.''\par \par \uc2 Home Is Where the Children Are\par \par \uc2 Deportations have muddled that delineation. In a recent line of deportees piling off a bus on the San Diego side of a metal gate leading to Tijuana, all were equal: the criminal in prison garb with the wispy goatee; the mother averting her eyes; and longtime residents like Alberto Alvarez, 36, a janitor and father of five who said he was picked up for driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 ''Look, I've been in the U.S. 18 years,'' he said, slinging a backpack over his Izod shirt. ''Right now, my children are alone, my wife is alone caring for the kids by herself -- they've separated us.''\par \par \uc2 During the immigration wave that peaked around a decade ago, deportations often meant something different: many deportees had not been in the United States for long; they were going home.\par \par \uc2 But now that there are fewer new arrivals, the concept of home is changing. Of the roughly 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, 48 percent arrived before 2000. For the 6.5 million Mexicans in the United States illegally, that figure is even higher -- 55 percent, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. There are now also 4.5 million American-born children of unauthorized immigrant parents.\par \par \uc2 Experts on both sides of the debate say this large group of rooted immigrants presents the nation with a fundamental choice: Either make life in the United States so difficult for illegal immigrants that they leave on their own, or allow immigrants who pose no threat to public safety to remain with their families legally, though not necessarily as citizens.\par \par \uc2 Steven A. Camarota, a demographer at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, said the government should revoke automatic citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants, and seize assets from deported illegal immigrants so they have fewer incentives to return.\par \par \uc2 President Obama, having made no progress on getting his legalization plan through Congress, has instead been trying to make enforcement more surgical. Under the new guidelines, officials will use ''prosecutorial discretion'' to review the current docket of 300,000 deportation cases, suspending expulsions for a range of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Several factors prompt ''particular care and consideration'' for a reprieve, including whether the person has been in the United States since childhood, or is pregnant, seriously ill, a member of the military or a minor, according to a June memo that initiated the change.\par \par \uc2 The issue of ''whether the person has a U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse, child or parent'' appears in the memo's secondary list of factors to consider. But it is not clear how broadly leniency will be applied. Repeat crossers are given a special black mark, and the administration has already deported hundreds of thousands of minor offenders, despite claiming to focus on ''the worst of the worst.''\par \par \uc2 Several Democratic governors and law enforcement officials are particularly angry about Secure Communities, a program to run the fingerprints of anyone booked by the police to check for federal immigration violations. A large proportion of those deported through this process -- 79 percent, according to a recent report by the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University -- were low-level offenders, often arrested for traffic violations.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials dispute that, saying the ratio of serious criminals is increasing, and that ultimately they must enforce immigration law against all violators. They have mandated that the program be used nationwide by 2013.\par \par \uc2 Mexico's border cities offer a portrait of what that could mean. Nearly 950,000 Mexican immigrants have been deported since the start of fiscal 2008. And in Tijuana -- a former hub for migrants heading north, which now receives more deportees than anywhere else -- the pool of deportees preparing to cross again just keeps growing.\par \par \uc2 Maria Garcia, 27, arrived here after being deported for a traffic violation. She said she had spent six years living in Fresno, Calif., with her two Mexico-born sons, 11 and 7. She was one of many who said that without a doubt, they would find their way back to the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''They can't stop us,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 The constant flow of deportees has become a growing concern for Mexican officials, who say the new arrivals are easy recruits, and victims, for drug cartels.\par \par \uc2 One former deportee was arrested this year for playing a major role in the deaths of around 200 people found in mass graves. In Tijuana, a homeless camp at the border has swollen from a cluster to a neighborhood, as deportees flow in, many carrying stories of being robbed or kidnapped by gangs who saw their American connections as a source for ransom.\par \par \uc2 Minutes after he arrived, Mr. Alvarez, the janitor, said he was worried about surviving -- ''you're playing with your life being here,'' he said. But his twin sons would turn 2 in a few weeks, and like many others, he said that no matter how he was treated in the United States, he would find his way back.\par \par \uc2 ''I feel bad being here, I feel bad,'' he said. ''I've got my kids over there, my family, my whole life. Here'' -- he shook his head at the end of his first day in Tijuana -- ''no.''\par \par \uc2 Immigration Upended: Articles in this series are exploring the changing patterns of immigration between the United States and Mexico.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: The Rivera-Ramirez family was deported in July and sent to live in a part of Tijuana, Mexico, that is rife with violence.

SHEAR   \par \uc2 1,384 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ask Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey whether his weight is a political asset or an election-year liability, and he shrugs.\par \par \uc2 ''It depends on the day,'' Mr. Christie said earlier this year, noting that his struggles with weight control could add to his ''everyman'' appeal or be a voter turnoff. ''Some days it may be an asset and some days it may be a liability.''\par \par \uc2 That may be the best way to describe everything about Mr. Christie as he considers the entreaties of donors and prominent Republicans who are urging him to make a late entry into an unsettled field of candidates vying for the Republican presidential nomination.\par \par \uc2 Those close to Mr. Christie say he is taking those entreaties very seriously despite his earlier insistence that he was not ready to be president. At one point this year, he joked that he would have to commit suicide to end the rumors of a 2012 candidacy.\par \par \uc2 But his very public resistance has given way to an urgent reconsideration, and his top advisers say the governor is well aware that he must make a decision, probably within days, about whether to mount a bid for the White House.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie, 49, a first-term governor whose paucity of government experience may be just what the doctor ordered, is a jumble of political contradictions. He's a conservative with some liberal views, a New Jersey politician who can bully but also frequently talks about compromise, and an obviously reluctant candidate who clearly hears the call of the national stage.\par \par \uc2 ''If Christie is the superpolitician his encouragers present, he should have the nomination locked up by mid-February,'' said Jim Dyke, an unaligned Republican strategist. But he said Mr. Christie's record would ''offer insights, contradictions and surprises -- all of which will sustain or destroy him depending on how he handles them.''\par \par \uc2 In two years as governor, he has succeeded in capping property taxes, rolling back pension benefits and balancing the state budget. But unemployment remains high in New Jersey, and his battles with the teachers' union have become legend.\par \par \uc2 Questions remain about his viability as a national candidate. Mr. Christie has often strayed far from his party's orthodoxy. In a speech last week, he praised the Bowles-Simpson plan to lower the nation's debt in part with increased tax revenues from closing loopholes -- a path opposed by many in his party.\par \par \uc2 He is on record acknowledging the ''undeniable'' science behind the idea that climate change is caused by human behavior, saying global warming is ''real and it is impacting our state.'' On gun control, Mr. Christie is out of step with Second Amendment supporters who view with suspicion any laws that restrict access to firearms.\par \par \uc2 When Jon S. Corzine, the former Democratic governor of New Jersey, accused him in 2009 of standing with the National Rifle Association, Mr. Christie's campaign noted his support of the federal assault weapons ban. ''Hardly the N.R.A. position,'' his literature said.\par \par \uc2 The most problematic issue may be his stand on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, as a federal prosecutor, Mr. Christie spoke what could be considered blasphemy among conservatives: ''Being in this country without proper documentation is not a crime,'' he said. ''The whole phrase of '\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ' connotes that the person, by just being here, is committing a crime.''\par \par \uc2 He has said repeatedly that leaders should not ''demagogue'' the issue of immigration, and he did not explicitly support tough state laws like the one put in place in Arizona last year. And when Tea Party conservatives were up in arms about plans to build an Islamic center near ground zero, he accused them of overreacting.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie's less conservative positions may help him capture independents in a general election against President Obama. And his blunt, straightforward style might contrast well with the president's well-known coolness.\par \par \uc2 In an era when people say they are tired of slick, preprogrammed politicians who faithfully repeat a focus-group-tested message, the New Jersey governor is anything but.\par \par \uc2 When Hurricane Irene was bearing down on his state's coastline, he bellowed ''get the hell off the beach!'' He waved off criticism of his use of a state helicopter to go to his son's baseball game as ''silliness'' (though he later reimbursed the state for its use). His vocabulary as governor regularly includes the words ''stupid,'' ''crap'' and ''insane.''\par \par \uc2 He is the anti-Mitt Romney; unprogrammed and unscripted. And with Mr. Romney now appearing to be the one to beat in the Republican primaries, there may be no better time for an alternative like Mr. Christie.\par \par \uc2 ''Polls show people are really frustrated with Washington right now,'' said Scott Reed, who managed Senator Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. ''A little straight talk will go a long way.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Christie's willingness to say anything could also hurt him in a presidential campaign in which mistakes, gaffes and flubs are hardly ever forgiven, as both Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas have learned.\par \par \uc2 For many people around the country, the image they have seen of a combative and feisty Mr. Christie is of him at a town-hall-style meeting, speaking bluntly to a teacher who stood up to accuse him of criticizing the profession. ''If what you want to do is put on a show and giggle every time I talk, well then I have no interest in answering your question,'' Mr. Christie said.\par \par \uc2 In another exchange captured on video, a woman asked why Mr. Christie sends his children to private schools.\par \par \uc2 ''First off, it's none of your business,'' the clearly irritated governor answered. ''I don't ask you where you send your kids to school. Don't bother me about where I send mine.''\par \par \uc2 But will such moments still seem like a breath of fresh air if they happen repeatedly on the campaign trail? One senior Republican strategist who is backing a current candidate suggested that voters might get tired of Mr. Christie's combative routine.\par \par \uc2 ''If you take the confrontational style all day, every day, I don't know how that wears,'' said the strategist, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized by the campaign to speak about Mr. Christie.\par \par \uc2 People close to the New Jersey governor say his political range is wider than that. And in one popular video, it is.\par \par \uc2 Responding to a popular Internet video of a 4-year-old boy crying because he wants to be governor of New Jersey, a jovial Mr. Christie signed a proclamation in April making the child governor for a day.\par \par \uc2 If he were to run, Mr. Christie would have to quickly deal with his past reluctance to get in the race. And logistically, he would start off way behind.\par \par \uc2 In the past, Mr. Christie has insisted that he is not ready to serve in the White House. ''You have to believe, as I've said before, in your heart and in your mind that you are ready,'' he said in an interview in February. ''And I don't believe that I am.''\par \par \uc2 That answer has the obvious benefit of making him seem more honest than the average politician. But once he is a candidate, he would have to find a way to answer the inevitable question about how he suddenly changed his mind.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie will also immediately face the challenge of raising money. The excitement among some very wealthy donors suggests that that might not be too difficult. But running for president requires a large fund-raising organization, and he would start millions of dollars behind rivals.\par \par \uc2 Right away, Mr. Christie would face the challenge of his schedule. Every day that he spends on the phone with donors is a day he's not spending in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina -- places that contenders have been visiting regularly for weeks.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Gov.

Page A4\par \par \uc2 CHINA FIRES 12 AFTER INQUIRY\par \par \uc2 Twelve Chinese government employees have been fired and stripped of their Communist Party membership after an investigation into accusations that family planning officials kidnapped children in a rural area, the party's official newspaper reported. Page A6\par \par \uc2 STRAUSS-KAHN FACES ACCUSER\par \par \uc2 Dominique Strauss-Kahn was brought face to face with the French writer who has accused him of trying to rape her eight years ago. In two hours of police questioning, he continued to deny any wrongdoing, one of his lawyers said. Page A9\par \par \uc2 AFGHAN LEADERS ON PAKISTAN\par \par \uc2 Afghanistan's president and other senior leaders announced that they were rethinking the country's relationship with Pakistan and its negotiations with the Taliban because talks had yielded so little. Page A10\par \par \uc2 PROTESTERS TRAP U.S. ENVOY\par \par \uc2 Pro-government Syrians attempted to assault an American diplomatic delegation that included the ambassador, striking its motorcade as it traveled to a meeting with an opposition figure in Damascus.

Deval Patrick on the defensive for his resistance to a federal program intended to deport criminals. Page A13\par \par \uc2 CURTAILING A HUNGER STRIKE\par \par \uc2 Corrections officials in Sacramento said that they would discipline inmates who participated in a renewed hunger strike to protest conditions in the state's highest-security prisons, where some prisoners have been held in virtual isolation for decades. Page A13\par \par \uc2 ABSENCES AT BORDER MEETING\par \par \uc2 Only one of the four American governors whose states share a border with Mexico attended the 29th annual Border Governors Conference. Their absence further complicated what had already become a politically charged atmosphere after Arizona's crackdown last year on illegal immigration. Page A16\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 FROM A LEGENDARY LANDFILL\par \par \uc2 TO A PARAGON OF ECOLOGY\par \par \uc2 A new plan by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation proposes to change the Freshkills landfill in Staten Island into a park featuring every environmentally correct practice known to landscape architecture. Page A19\par \par \uc2 Business\par \par \uc2 INDIA'S ROVING TELLERS BRING\par \par \uc2 THE BANKS TO THE PEOPLE\par \par \uc2 In India's rural areas, roving human tellers use laptop computers, wireless modems and fingerprint scanners to provide bank accounts and financial services for the nearly 50 percent of the country's population that do not have them. Page B1\par \par \uc2 NOKIA TO REDUCE EMPLOYEES\par \par \uc2 Nokia\uc2 , the Finnish cellphone maker, said that it would eliminate 6 percent of its work force by closing a factory in Romania and transferring production to Asia. Page B3\par \par \uc2 MADOFF TRUSTEE'S GOOD NEWS\par \par \uc2 The trustee for Bernard L. Madoff's fraud victims said that he had overestimated how much his recovery efforts will be affected by a court ruling this week in his case against the owners of the New York Mets. Page B3\par \par \uc2 SPAIN STOPS LOTTERY PLAN\par \par \uc2 Spain has shelved a planned initial public offering for just under a third of the national lottery operator, saying poor market conditions meant it would probably not have raised the desired amount. Page B4\par \par \uc2 Sports\par \par \uc2 ON BASEBALL'S BATTLEFIELD,\par \par \uc2 THE CLASSIC CONFRONTATION\par \par \uc2 Heavyweight boxers trade punches, tennis players exchange ground strokes and basketball players go one-on-one. In baseball, writes Bill Pennington, the direct confrontations are more likely between hitters and pitchers. Page B8\par \par \uc2 Weekend\par \par \uc2 AN ART SHOW WITH GOALS\par \par \uc2 BEYOND SELF-EXPRESSION\par \par \uc2 ''Living as Form,'' is an enthralling, philosophically provocative round-up of socially engaged art, writes Ken Johnson. Mostly housed in the cavernous interior of the Historic Essex Street Market in New York City, the artists' goal was to expand the definitions of art. Most of the pieces eschew ambivalence and veer toward real world, practical results.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON -- A fatal accident that the police say involved an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  driving drunk has stirred outrage in Massachusetts and put Gov. Deval Patrick on the defensive for his resistance to a federal program intended to deport criminals.\par \par \uc2 According to the police, the immigrant, Nicolas Guaman from Ecuador, struck and killed a young motorcyclist in Milford last month while intoxicated, dragging him for a quarter of a mile. Mr. Guaman has a previous criminal record, the police said, and many here have pointed to his case as an example of why the federal program, known as Secure Communities, is necessary.\par \par \uc2 Under Secure Communities, the fingerprints of anyone booked into jail by the state and local police are sent through the F.B.I. to the Department of Homeland Security, which tracks immigration violations. Immigration agents then decide whether to deport immigrants flagged by such checks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Patrick, a Democrat, announced in June that Massachusetts would not participate in Secure Communities, citing concerns that it casts too wide a net and leads to the deportation of immigrants with no criminal histories. Two other Democratic governors, Pat Quinn of Illinois and Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, have also rejected the program, though the Obama administration has announced plans to expand it nationwide, with or without states' support, by the end of 2013.\par \par \uc2 The Guaman case and several others -- including that of Onyango Obama, a Kenyan uncle of President Obama who was arrested last month outside Boston on drunken-driving charges and found to be in violation of a 1992 deportation order -- have become part of a growing debate over whether Massachusetts is too easy on illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Critics, including some Democrats, are also asking why Mr. Patrick, a close ally of Mr. Obama's, would reject a program central to Mr. Obama's immigration enforcement plan. The Obama administration has taken steps recently to focus its deportation strategy on illegal immigrants who have been convicted of violent and drug-related crimes.\par \par \uc2 ''Unfortunately, the governor doesn't think it's a serious enough problem to deal with,'' said State Senator Richard T. Moore, a Democrat whose district includes Milford. ''We're hearing from the public constantly: what are we going to do about this problem?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Moore is co-sponsoring new bipartisan legislation meant to crack down on illegal immigration, in part by imposing tougher penalties, including possible jail time, for driving without a license and not registering cars properly. Mr. Guaman was not carrying a license at the time of his arrest.\par \par \uc2 Onyango Obama, the half brother of the president's father, who did have a driver's license, was taken into custody on an immigration detainer after his arrest in Framingham on Aug. 24. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released him on Sept. 8 but has refused to say why, citing federal privacy laws.\par \par \uc2 In another recent case, a Mexican immigrant was arrested on a charge of drunken driving last weekend in Boxborough, and the police said he had five previous drunken-driving convictions. The man, Eduardo A. Torres, had been deported three times previously, according to immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Mr. Moore joined three county sheriffs at a State House news conference calling for Mr. Patrick to embrace the Secure Communities program immediately. Also on Wednesday, Senator Scott Brown, a Republican facing re-election next year, urged Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary, to ''proceed with the full activation'' of the program in Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 He also suggested that Mr. Patrick's resistance would delay the program's activation in Massachusetts; it currently operates only in Boston. But a spokesman for the immigration agency, which runs the program, said that would not be a factor.\par \par \uc2 The sheriffs of Bristol, Plymouth and Worcester Counties, all Republicans, said they were working with federal officials to adopt elements of the program in their counties immediately. Mr. Patrick said on Wednesday that the state already sends fingerprints of arrestees to the F.B.I., which is free to share them with immigration agents. The state also sends fingerprints of convicted criminals directly to the immigration agency once they arrive in state prisons, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''This is about grandstanding and headlines,'' Mr. Patrick said of his critics on the issue. ''Meanwhile, the public should know that every fingerprint is sent to the federal government; they should know that every felony is referred to the federal government.''\par \par \uc2 It is far from certain that Mr. Moore's bill will pass both houses of the legislature; similar crackdowns in recent years have passed the Senate but not the more liberal House of Representatives. But Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, said she was worried.\par \par \uc2 ''We seem to continue to lose supporters,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Millona added that it was unfair to connect drunken driving with illegal immigration. ''Drunk driving is another issue, and people should be punished for it,'' she said. ''But immigration status has nothing to do with it.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Nicolas Guaman\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110930e79u00073\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ENSENADA, Mexico -- The opening ceremony of a border governors forum here had it all: mariachi singers and a fireworks show entertained dignitaries who vowed to renew a spirit of cooperation between the states lining both sides of the United States-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 There was only one thing missing from the 29th annual Border Governors Conference: Three United States governors.\par \par \uc2 Only one of the four American governors whose states share a border with Mexico -- Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico -- attended the conference. The other three -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona and Gov. Jerry Brown of California -- said their schedules prevented them from attending. At the opening ceremony, Mexican governors shared a stage with Ms. Martinez and two state government officials from California and Arizona. Mr. Perry sent no representatives from his office.\par \par \uc2 The absence of the American governors complicated an already politically charged atmosphere. For years, the forum has been a kind of feel-good photo-op for governors and their aides, who gather to issue proclamations, improve coordination and set priorities on immigration, economic development, energy, tourism and other concerns. But last year, Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigration disrupted the conference and strained relations among the governors.\par \par \uc2 The conference was scheduled to be held in Phoenix last year, but all six Mexican border governors told Ms. Brewer that they intended to boycott it. They were protesting the state law she championed authorizing local police officers to inquire about the immigration status of anyone that they stop if they suspect that the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Ms. Brewer then canceled the conference, though an interim meeting was later held in Santa Fe. The governor of New Mexico at the time, Bill Richardson, was the only one of the four United States governors to attend.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Brewer had planned on attending this year's conference, but backed out suddenly the day before the opening ceremony on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for Ms. Brewer said she had to focus on issues concerning the state's child welfare agency and to meet with officials who completed a report on overhauling the system.\par \par \uc2 ''She was really disappointed that she couldn't make it,'' said the spokeswoman, Tasya C. Peterson. ''She was really looking forward to coming. If there were any fences broken last year, I think that we've mended those fences, and we're mending those as we speak.''\par \par \uc2 Aides to Ms. Brewer and the two other absent governors stressed that their lack of attendance had nothing to do with the controversy over last year's conference and that they remained focused year-round on border issues and on maintaining relationships with their Mexican counterparts.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Brewer's absence, in particular, was a topic of debate at the conference, held Wednesday and Thursday at a seaside hotel in Ensenada. Many believed that had she made an appearance, she would have been welcomed and praised by Mexican officials, while others said they suspected the political fallout from last year was at least in part to blame for her cancellation and the nonattendance of the two other governors.\par \par \uc2 ''The signal sent by the three governors who are not here from the United States is that the relationship has suffered,'' said Rick Van Schoik, director of the North American Center for Transborder Studies at Arizona State University, one of several United States border scholars at the conference. ''Instead of last year being a hiccup, we now have a plateau, instead of solid progress on all the issues.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Martinez, the governor of New Mexico, described the meeting as a success, and said it would be wrong to read too much into the lack of attendance. ''I just think it is what it is: It's just busy schedules,'' she said. ''I have had to, in the past nine months, cancel and reschedule other events that are extremely important. But you can't be everywhere all the time.''\par \par \uc2 Andrew Selee, the director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico Institute, said that the turnout from the American governors was more a statement about the vitality of the conference than the debate over illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 ''This is an organization that has enormous potential to have an influence on U.S.-Mexico relations and on the future of the border, but it hasn't really found its path yet,'' Mr. Selee said. ''U.S. governors, who are pulled in many directions, don't see it as a vital venue where they have to be, politically.''\par \par \uc2 The conference has neither an office nor a staff. Each of the 10 states that host the forum on a rotating basis -- next year's conference is scheduled for New Mexico -- serves as the principal organizer. ''There's not an umbrella organization, and there's no central staff, and that's one of the difficulties of trying to find coherence from year to year or issue to issue,'' Mr. Van Schoik said. ''It's not been a hugely successful 10-part dialogue over the years. It has been good photo-ops, good chances to talk, good chances to network among the work tables, but the amount actually accomplished is much less than it might imply.''\par \par \uc2 Though none of the Mexican governors publicly addressed the absence of the American governors, Mexican officials expressed their disappointment in private.\par \par \uc2 Guillermo Padres Elias, the governor of Sonora, said he did not think that a lack of interest in the conference was a factor.\par \par \uc2 ''If it was, I think it's a mistake on their part,'' he said, adding that work must be done to strengthen the conference. ''I think it's the right path. It's always worked, and it has to keep on working, because the dependence between one state and the other, and one country and the other, it's not going to end.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: A border fence in southern New Mexico.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc13}{\*\bkmkend toc13}\b \uc2 Alabama Wins in Ruling On Its Immigration Law\b0\par\par\uc2 By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON   \par \uc2 1,112 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 September 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 A federal judge on Wednesday upheld most of the sections of Alabama's far-reaching immigration law that had been challenged by the Obama administration, including portions that had been blocked in other states.\par \par \uc2 The decision, by Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn of Federal District Court in Birmingham, makes it much more likely that the fate of the recent flurry of state laws against illegal immigration will eventually be decided by the Supreme Court. It also means that Alabama now has by far the strictest such law of any state.\par \par \uc2 ''Today Judge Blackburn upheld the majority of our law,'' Gov. Robert Bentley said in a brief statement he delivered outside the State Capitol in Montgomery. ''With those parts that were upheld, we have the strongest immigration law in the country.''\par \par \uc2 The judge did issue a preliminary injunction against several sections of the law, agreeing with the government's case that they pre-empted federal law. She blocked a broad provision that outlawed the harboring or transporting of illegal immigrants and another that barred illegal immigrants from enrolling in or attending public universities.\par \par \uc2 The governor, in his statement, said he believed even the sections that were temporarily enjoined on Wednesday would eventually be upheld, and added that the state would consider appealing if that did not happen.\par \par \uc2 For the most part, Judge Blackburn, who was appointed by the elder President George Bush, disagreed with the Justice Department's arguments, including those that had been successful in challenges to laws in Arizona and Georgia.\par \par \uc2 The judge upheld a section that requires state and local law enforcement officials to try to verify a person's immigration status during routine traffic stops or arrests, if ''a reasonable suspicion'' exists that the person is in the country illegally. And she ruled that a section that criminalized the ''willful failure'' of a person in the country illegally to carry federal immigration papers did not pre-empt federal law.\par \par \uc2 In both cases, she rejected the reasoning of district and appeals courts that had blocked similar portions of Arizona's law. Legal experts expected the Justice Department to appeal.\par \par \uc2 ''The department is reviewing the decision to determine next steps,'' Xochitl Hinojosa, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''We will continue to evaluate state immigration-related laws and will not hesitate to bring suit if, in fact, a state creates its own immigration policy or enforces state laws in a manner that interferes with federal immigration law.''\par \par \uc2 The Alabama law was the latest, and broadest, of the state laws against illegal immigration, going further than one passed in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 While Alabama is estimated to have a relatively small population of people who are in the country illegally, the numbers have been growing.\par \par \uc2 Acting on a pledge that they would crack down on illegal immigration, Republicans passed the bill when they won a supermajority in the State Legislature in the 2010 elections. Mr. Bentley signed it into law in June.\par \par \uc2 Del Marsh, the Republican president pro tem of the Alabama Senate, said in a statement after Wednesday's ruling, ''Our goal has always been to make sure Alabama jobs and taxpayer-funded resources are going to legal Alabama residents, and Judge Blackburn's ruling is a significant win for this cause.''\par \par \uc2 All summer, rallies for and against the law have been taking place throughout the state. Farmers and even the state agriculture commissioner have raised concerns about the law's effect on farms, sheriffs have condemned it as too onerous for financially hurting counties and others have worried that it could seriously hinder the state's efforts to rebuild after last April's devastating tornadoes.\par \par \uc2 The law's backers argued that most of the concerns arose out of a misreading of the law that they believed in some cases was intentional.\par \par \uc2 The judge ruled on three suits challenging the law on Wednesday, one brought by the federal government, another by a group of church leaders and another brought by civil rights groups.\par \par \uc2 She dismissed the suit brought by church leaders, who had argued that the law prevented them from carrying out crucial duties of their ministry, concluding that they did not have standing to challenge one part of the law and that she had addressed the other challenge in her ruling on the federal law.\par \par \uc2 Judge Blackburn agreed with the arguments of the civil rights groups on several sections or subsections of the law, but did not address many of their arguments because they overlapped with those put forth in the Justice Department's suit.\par \par \uc2 ''We're really disappointed,'' said Andre Segura of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents plaintiffs in one of the suits. ''We already know that this is going to cause a lot of problems in Alabama.''\par \par \uc2 The civil rights groups are planning an appeal.\par \par \uc2 Among the other sections Judge Blackburn upheld: one that nullifies any contracts entered into by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ; another that forbids any transaction between an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and any division of the state, a proscription that has already led to the denial of a Montgomery man's application for water and sewage service; and, most controversially, a section that requires elementary and secondary schools to determine the immigration status of incoming students.\par \par \uc2 The civil rights groups challenged this last section on the ground that it would unlawfully deter students from enrolling in school, even if it did not explicitly allow schools to turn students away. The judge dismissed their challenge for lack of standing, though she did not rule on the argument's merits.\par \par \uc2 Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University, said: ''This decision really gives the anti-immigration folks more of a victory than they've been getting in other courts. There's a lot for them to be happy about.''\par \par \uc2 Still, Professor Spiro added, ''This is not the last word on the constitutionality of this statute.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: September 30, 2011, Friday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a federal judge's ruling that upheld most of Alabama's far-reaching immigration law misstated the role of the American Civil Liberties Union in one of the lawsuits challenging the law. The A.C.L.U. represents plaintiffs in the suit; it is not itself a plaintiff.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Judge Sharon Blackburn upheld most parts of a measure.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Children whose parents are illegal immigrants or who lack legal status themselves face ''uniformly negative'' effects on their social development from early childhood until they become adults, according to a study by four researchers published Wednesday in the Harvard Educational Review.\par \par \uc2 The study concluded that more than five million children in the United States are ''at risk of lower educational performance, economic stagnation, blocked mobility and ambiguous belonging'' because they are growing up in immigrant families affected by illegal status.\par \par \uc2 The study is the first to pull together field research by social scientists nationwide to track the effects of a family's illegal immigration status on children from birth until they graduate from college and start to navigate the job market. It covers immigrants from a variety of origins, including Latinos and Asians.\par \par \uc2 About 5.5 million children in this country have at least one parent who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , according to an estimate by the Pew Hispanic Center. Among them, about one million children were brought here illegally by their parents, while about 4.5 million are United States citizens because they were born here.\par \par \uc2 In all, about 9.5 million people live in ''mixed status'' families that include American citizen children and unauthorized immigrants, Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer at the Pew center, said on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 ''Unauthorized status casts a big shadow that really extends to citizen as well as undocumented children,'' Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, a professor of education at New York University who is an author of the study, said on Tuesday. ''It affects their cognitive development, engagement in school and their ability to be emerging citizens.''\par \par \uc2 The Harvard study reports that ''fear and vigilance'' guide the home lives of young children whose parents are illegal immigrants, making the parents significantly less likely to engage with teachers or be active in schools.\par \par \uc2 Parents' fears of deportation led to lower levels of enrollment of their American children in public programs for which the children were legally eligible, including child care subsidies, public preschool and food stamps, the study found.\par \par \uc2 The other authors were Carola Suarez-Orozco and Robert T. Teranishi of New York University and Hirokazu Yoshikawa of the Harvard Graduate School of Education.\par \par \uc2 Many \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents work long hours in low-wage jobs, sometimes more than one job. New research on very young children cited in the Harvard study showed that the undocumented parents' difficult work conditions ''contribute substantially to the lower cognitive skills of children in their families.'' This was true even though the children were more likely to be in two-parent families than American children as a whole.\par \par \uc2 As teenagers, children without legal status face a hard awakening when they apply for jobs, driver's licenses or financial aid for college and discover they are not legally qualified for any of them. Their paths diverge from siblings who are American citizens by birthright.\par \par \uc2 ''In late adolescence, they start to realize their legal limitations, and their worlds turn completely upside down,'' said Roberto G. Gonzales, a sociologist at the University of Chicago whose research on college-age illegal immigrants is cited in the Harvard study.\par \par \uc2 Academic achievement does little to lift the prospects of illegal immigrants who have grown up here. Out of 150 immigrants Professor Gonzales studied in depth, 31 had completed college or advanced degrees, but none were in a career that matched their educational training. Many were working low-wage jobs like their parents.\par \par \uc2 The Harvard study found that many \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youths, facing the ''reduced promise of mobility,'' had dropped out of school and begun the search for work they could do without legal papers, ''forced deeper and deeper into an underground work force.''\par \par \uc2 The researchers said that a generation of young illegal immigrants raised in this country was moving toward ''perpetual outsider-hood.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110921e79l0005u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA -- Twenty-one illegal immigrants will continue to receive regular dialysis at no cost for three years under an agreement disclosed Friday by Atlanta's public hospital, Grady Memorial, and the world's largest dialysis provider, \uc2 Fresenius Medical Care\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The deal solves an impasse created when a previous one-year contract between Grady and Fresenius expired on Aug. 31 and the dialysis provider refused to serve patients who showed up for their regular thrice-a-week treatments.\par \par \uc2 The patients spent the past week seeking care in Atlanta-area emergency rooms, including Grady's, which are required by federal law to screen and treat those at risk of impairment or death.\par \par \uc2 In some instances, ailing patients were turned away by emergency room doctors who determined that their elevated potassium levels and fluid retention were not yet severe enough to justify emergency treatment. Each renal patient's need for dialysis is different, but those unable to artificially clean the toxic substances from their blood can die in as little as two weeks.\par \par \uc2 One of the patients, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  named Reina Andrade, chose to fly home to Honduras on Wednesday morning after being denied treatment by Grady's emergency room on Saturday, becoming seriously ill on Sunday and receiving dialysis through another hospital's emergency room that night, according to her sister, Marlen Andrade.\par \par \uc2 Hours after Reina Andrade and her 9-year-old son boarded a flight for Tegucigalpa, Grady and Fresenius announced that they had an agreement in principle to restore the treatments.\par \par \uc2 ''That was too late for her,'' said Marlen Andrade, who lived with her sister near Atlanta. ''She's already gone. I told myself that God must have a plan for her.''\par \par \uc2 Marlen Andrade said she learned from relatives on Friday that her sister received dialysis in Tegucigalpa that morning, and that her family had scraped together enough to pay for perhaps two weeks of treatments. There is no provision for free care in Honduras, she said.\par \par \uc2 The agreement between Grady and Fresenius would allow Ms. Andrade to receive treatment in Atlanta if she could return here. But that would require a rigorous illegal border crossing that can be physically challenging even for the healthy.\par \par \uc2 ''In her condition, she could never cross the border illegally again, never,'' Marlen Andrade said. Reina Andrade was fit when she first immigrated to the United States 12 years ago, her sister said, but developed kidney disease several years later.\par \par \uc2 The patients' odyssey began two years ago when Grady closed its outpatient dialysis clinic, where many had received free treatment for years. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for Medicare, which covers most dialysis costs for American citizens. After the immigrants filed a lawsuit and gained news media attention, the hospital agreed to pay Fresenius to care for them during a transitional period. Other than the past week, it has never ended.\par \par \uc2 Under the new contract, Grady agrees to pay Fresenius $15,500 per patient per year for treatment at the company's outpatient clinics. That is less than half of the $750,000 flat fee Grady paid Fresenius for the yearlong contract that just ended.\par \par \uc2 Grady, which receives direct appropriations from two county governments, faces a budget shortfall of more than $20 million this year. It maintained in negotiations that it could not afford to pay Fresenius the previous rates.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Adolfo Sanchez was one of the illegal immigrants whose kidney dialysis treatments were at stake during recent talks in Atlanta.

Allowing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  adults to obtain a college education does not change that. All it does is create yet another magnet to entice people to enter or stay in the United States illegally and take resources from citizens and legal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 You scoff at the $40 million the program will cost. Take $40 million here and $40 million there, and pretty soon it adds up to real money, particularly when education budgets face deep cuts and tuitions soar.\par \par \uc2 California does not have the luxury to spend tax dollars unwisely. Nor does it have the luxury to keep enticing illegal immigrants to come and reap its taxpayer-supported benefits.\par \par \uc2 The United States must take away the magnets that draw illegal immigrants to this country, not provide more.\par \par \uc2 ELTON GALLEGLY\par \par \uc2 Washington, Sept. 8, 2011\par \par \uc2 The writer, a Republican of California, is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110910e79a0006k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc17}{\*\bkmkend toc17}\b \uc2 All-American, Floor to Roof? Not So Simple\b0\par\par\uc2 By KIRK JOHNSON  \par \uc2 1,261 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 September 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 BOZEMAN, Mont. -- Anders Lewendal, a general contractor who managed to survive the housing collapse, has hit upon a plan that he thinks will revive the construction industry and help lead the nation out of the economic wilderness: build houses using only American-made materials.\par \par \uc2 He is trying to do just that with a new home here on a side street a few blocks from downtown. But it is not as easy as it sounds.\par \par \uc2 Some things are simple enough. Wood literally grows on trees, of course, especially here in forested western Montana. And no one ships cement or concrete mix any farther than needed.\par \par \uc2 After that it can get tough. In a global economy, even American-assembled appliances probably have at least some foreign made or mined components, Mr. Lewendal said.\par \par \uc2 Tiny components like nails, screws and light bulbs, mundane but crucial, are significantly cheaper if bought from China or other developing nations. High-end frills -- which tend to be imported, like Italian marble or mahogany -- may be doomed to stay on the dock or in the showroom.\par \par \uc2 And all that does not even repress the question of whether using \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor, a mainstay of the construction industry around the nation, counts as foreign.\par \par \uc2 ''Part of the impact of the recession has been healthy, in making people rethink what housing is for,'' said Mr. Lewendal, who conceded that perfection in his goal is probably not possible. The locally made cement, he suspects, could have some imported chemicals, for example, and the recycled glass from Yellowstone National Park that he laid down as a base layer under the garage could well have contained an imported beer bottle or two. As for his workers, he said, they are all here legally.\par \par \uc2 ''The point is that little things can rep up,'' he said. ''I think we could solve this recession if everyone shifted just 5 percent of their purchases to U.S.-made products.''\par \par \uc2 In some ways, it is an old idea, echoing a hard-hat refrain from the 1970s or earlier: Buy American. In other ways, though, it is as current as the environmental message that hangs over every urban farmers' market: Buy Local.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lewendal said that because the 2,280-square-foot, three-bedroom house he is building will conform to high energy-conservation standards -- more points are awarded for materials obtained close to the site -- the economic and social implications all blur. And in a brutally competitive local market, he reped, pitching all-American could also be a marketing niche in tune with the times.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't see any politics to it at all,'' said Mr. Lewendal, 51, who described himself as a conservative and is the chairman of the local homebuilder association's green building committee. ''It's about jobs.''\par \par \uc2 The house's owner, Kat Quinn, also has a complex agenda. For health reasons, she wanted a house built to strict environmental standards, and after she met Mr. Lewendal and heard about the all-American home idea, she became convinced that buying American could put pressure on foreign companies to raise wages for their workers.\par \par \uc2 She said she does plan, though, on having a Canadian-made trampoline in the house, to use in therapy for a daughter with cystic fibrosis.\par \par \uc2 Bozeman's economy was not devastated across the board by the recession. Montana State University, a big local employer, created a base of stability, and the proximity to Yellowstone, about 90 minutes south, kept up a flow of tourists.\par \par \uc2 But where bad times bit, they bit hard, and that was in construction. The vacation- and second-home market that plumbers, roofers and framers depended on dwindled to almost nothing starting in 2007, taking out more than a third of all the construction work here in Gallatin County in just 24 months, according to state figures.\par \par \uc2 Justin Tribbitt, a former general contractor now working in computer software, lost his company; three of his five former employees left town. Mike Wilhelm, an electrician, went from six employees to two. Rock Larocca, also a contractor, survived with the aid of a chainsaw, helping cut down trees killed by a beetle infestation.\par \par \uc2 ''It's kind of like getting a drink out of the garden hose and suddenly the valve shuts off and it's dry,'' said Mr. Tribbitt, 32. ''It was gone just like that.''\par \par \uc2 Some who managed to hang on said that whether the all-American home idea is good marketing for Lewendal Construction or good economics for the country, or both, it feels right to them. Mr. Lewendal, admirers said, is taking action.\par \par \uc2 ''More power to him,'' said Ryan Engbretson, a builder who said that his company had survived mainly by doing repair work.\par \par \uc2 Economists say it is hard to verify Mr. Lewendal's assertion that about 75 percent of the average American home is made in the United States already, mainly because it does not appear to be something anyone has deeply studied. His estimates that going American will rep only 2 percent to 3 percent to the $265,000 construction cost of the Bozeman house by the time final purchases are done -- he is still shopping for things like light fixtures -- are also difficult to independently confirm.\par \par \uc2 ''The truth is that we are in a global economy and it's very interconnected, for good or bad,'' said Albert Saiz, an assistant professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania and co-editor of the journal Housing Economics. ''It's very hard to know the impact of your purchasing decisions and the consequences of what you do.''\par \par \uc2 Professor Saiz said the fluid nature of labor markets could also make the implications of all-American more complicated. In much of the nation, for example, though less so in this working-class corner of Montana, houses are built with Mexican or other foreign-born labor, which is a kind of foreign input since a part of the wages often goes back across the border.\par \par \uc2 And if demand for, say, nails or screws made in the United States did go up, Professor Saiz said, the basic manufacturing industry jobs created -- low skill and probably low pay -- are the kind that American workers are often disinclined to take anyway.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Lewendal, who earned an undergraduate degree in economics before going into construction, said costs and benefits are more complicated than a spreadsheet can convey. The nails he bought from a company in Illinois are about $5 more per box, for instance, but he said they jam the nail guns less often than the cheaper Chinese brands, which are less uniform.\par \par \uc2 ''If a guy has to get down three times a day to clear the gun, that's time wasted,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Some elements of his experiment are certain to endure, if only inside the home itself. Mr. Lewendal, in showing a reporter around the house, which he hopes to complete this fall, repeatedly illustrated his ideas with diagrams and math equations, scrawling with a black marker on the bare beams and panels -- writing that will be preserved, like a time-capsule message to the future, behind the wallboard when the work is done.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Anders Lewendal, below right, wants to use only American-made components in the house he is building in Bozeman, Mont.; Kat Quinn owns the house Mr. Lewendal is building, and she has reasons of her own for liking his all-American approach.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 On Feb. 3, a man walked into N&K Quick Pick in the Rockland County village of Spring Valley and purchased a $10 scratch-off instant lottery ticket. It was a $3 million winner, but it turned out to be anything but instant.\par \par \uc2 When the man, who speaks limited English, told a store clerk that he had stumbled upon a fortune, the clerk, according to the authorities, hatched a plan with the store's owner and a third man. They told the man, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  working as a painter, that he would be deported if he tried to claim the winnings.\par \par \uc2 ''When he presented the ticket, they scared the hell out of him,'' said Thomas P. Zugibe, the Rockland County district attorney.\par \par \uc2 The three persuaded him that they would arrange for him to get some of the money if he gave the ticket to the clerk, Atif Ali according to Mr. Zugibe, who said Mr. Ali collected the first $150,000 annual payout and sold the rights to the rest for $600,000.\par \par \uc2 After waiting several months without receiving a dime, the ticket buyer hired a lawyer, Thomas Sassone.\par \par \uc2 ''They basically defrauded him,'' Mr. Sassone said. He asked the New York Lottery to investigate, the district attorney was called, and over the last two weeks, Mr. Ali, of Spring Valley, N.Y.; the store owner, Riaz Khan of Monroe, N.Y.; and Mubeen Ashraf, also of Monroe, were charged with first-degree grand larceny.\par \par \uc2 The three men could not be reached for comment on Friday, and Mr. Khan sold the store in July. The arrests were reported Friday by The Journal News of White Plains.\par \par \uc2 To collect a jackpot, a winner must sign the back of the ticket to prevent others from claiming the prize, said Carolyn Hapeman, a spokeswoman for the New York Lottery. But the rightful winner of the $3 million ticket, whose name was not released, had already signed it. So Mr. Ali, according to Mr. Sassone, had the man sign a document attesting that they bought the ticket together.\par \par \uc2 Though Ms. Hapeman said lottery officials were skeptical, they authorized the first of 20 annual $150,000 payments. She noted that lottery officials do not ask for the immigration status of winners.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ali, the authorities said, then sold the rights for the rest of the jackpot to a company called Advance Funding for $600,000.\par \par \uc2 An office manager at Advance Funding, who declined to give her name because she was not authorized to speak for the company, said it made the payment after the New York Lottery sent documents that said Mr. Ali had purchased the ticket.\par \par \uc2 Most of the money was deposited in a bank account that the authorities have now frozen. The real buyer will most likely receive that money, but it is still unclear, Mr. Zugibe said, how much of the rest of the $3 million jackpot he will get, since Advance Funding may claim it still has the rights to it.\par \par \uc2 ''We're not looking to hurt anybody,'' said Mr. Sassone, the winner's lawyer. ''He just wants to get his money back and to get left alone.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110903e79300053\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA -- After the collapse of negotiations between Atlanta's public hospital and the world's largest dialysis provider, a dozen immigrants suffering from renal failure were refused treatment at an Atlanta clinic on Thursday and advised to wait until their conditions deteriorated enough to justify life-saving care in an emergency room.\par \par \uc2 Unless the deadlock is broken, 22 patients, most of them illegal immigrants, face a debilitating cycle. Rather than receiving dialysis three times a week, as is standard protocol for cleansing their blood of toxins, they must wait until they are in sufficiently serious jeopardy to trigger the federal law that requires hospital care.\par \par \uc2 Dialysis patients said that typically means placing themselves at risk of serious impairment or death. ''Trust me, it is just like dying,'' said Bineet Kaur, 28, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from India who was turned away on Thursday morning from the clinic, operated by \uc2 Fresenius Medical Care\uc2 . ''You are almost unconscious, you know. Even if you are talking, your brain is not working. Sometimes you have to be hospitalized for days or weeks.''\par \par \uc2 The patients' odyssey, which dramatizes the moral and fiscal quandaries of providing health care to illegal immigrants, began two years ago, when new management at the hospital here, Grady Memorial, shut its budget-draining outpatient dialysis clinic. The closing displaced about 60 uninsured immigrants, many of whom had relied on free treatment there for years.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants are not eligible for Medicare, which covers most dialysis costs for citizens with renal disease. And few have access to insurance.\par \par \uc2 Grady volunteered to transport patients to other states or their home countries and to pay for three months of treatment. Some accepted. But in response to a patient lawsuit and media scrutiny, the hospital eventually contracted with Fresenius to treat the others for one transitional year.\par \par \uc2 When that contract expired in August 2010, Grady grudgingly negotiated a one-year extension. Thirteen patients were taken by various dialysis providers as charity cases, and Grady agreed to pay for treatment of the remaining 25 at Fresenius clinics. The hospital, which is partly financed through county appropriations, has spent more than $2 million on the patients since closing its dialysis unit, said Matt Gove, a senior vice president.\par \par \uc2 As the Aug. 31 expiration of the new contract approached, Grady and Fresenius again tried to negotiate an extension. But after a temporary improvement in its bottom line, Grady now faces a $20 million shortfall, Mr. Gove said. ''This isn't a traditional business negotiation where we're trying to low-ball,'' he said. ''We're broke.''\par \par \uc2 Jane A. Kramer, a spokeswoman for \uc2 Fresenius Medical Care North America\uc2 , said her company negotiated with Grady until Wednesday. Last week, the company notified patients that they would have to seek emergency treatment at Grady, where Fresenius also operates the inpatient dialysis service.\par \par \uc2 Regardless, 12 patients showed up at a Fresenius clinic on Thursday for their usual dialysis and a manager told them they would not be treated, patients said.\par \par \uc2 The hospital and the provider disagreed about which was responsible for keeping the patients alive.\par \par \uc2 ''They are Grady patients,'' Ms. Kramer said. ''While we are very concerned by the situation this places the patients in, the patients must seek treatment from Grady.'' Fresenius anticipates worldwide net income of more than $1 billion this year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gove responded indignantly. ''There cannot be a debate about one thing,'' he said. ''This group of patients has been under the care of Fresenius and their doctors for two years. If Fresenius decided to discharge a patient because they are unable to pay, that is Fresenius's decision, having nothing to do with Grady.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110902e7920005o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. -- When Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico handed over the keys of a state-owned jet to a wealthy businessman and his wife for $2.5 million last week, she was eliminating one more remnant of her predecessor, Bill Richardson.\par \par \uc2 ''Last year, when I was running for governor, I not only promised taxpayers that I would not use this state jet as a personal air taxi, I promised New Mexicans across the state that I would get rid of this symbol of greed and excess in state government,'' she said at a news conference on Thursday, with Richard and Linda Felland, the new owners of the plane, a 2005 Cessna Citation Bravo, by her side.\par \par \uc2 In her first eight months in office, Ms. Martinez, a Republican, has rarely wasted a chance to differentiate herself from Mr. Richardson, the once-popular Democrat who wound up two terms as governor last year with an approval rating in the weeds.\par \par \uc2 ''We have our own agenda,'' Ms. Martinez, 52, said in an interview in Mr. Richardson's old office, while acknowledging that ''some of it has been to undo his.''\par \par \uc2 She has signed executive orders reversing policies dear to Mr. Richardson and pushed the Legislature, with mixed success, to eliminate others. Along the way, she has sought to put her own conservative imprint on a state that has long been a Democratic sure thing.\par \par \uc2 On the environment, she pulled New Mexico out of a federal program to reintroduce Mexican gray wolves into the Southwest and suspended global warming regulations. ''You couldn't have a stronger contrast between Richardson and Martinez,'' said John Horning, executive director of WildEarth Guardians, a conservation group in Santa Fe that often butts heads with the Martinez administration.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Martinez would not disagree with that. ''I don't see myself as someone who doesn't understand the need to protect the environment,'' said the governor, who is a skeptic when it comes to man-made global warming.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Martinez has quickly learned the limits of her power. The State Supreme Court overturned the climate change order she issued days into her term and the Democratic-controlled Legislature has refused to go along with her in other instances.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, Ms. Martinez has made her presence known through dramatic gestures like sending aides with video cameras into the Legislature to post on the Web what she sees as the lawmakers' penchant for private deal making.\par \par \uc2 While critics call her pro-business to the extreme, Ms. Martinez has fashioned herself in some respects as a populist, a strategy that seems to be resonating with voters, political analysts say.\par \par \uc2 With the state's finances in crisis, she urged the public to e-mail her suggestions on trimming costs, and adopted some of them. When record low temperatures caused gas shortages last winter, the governor lashed out publicly against the New Mexico Gas Company, which she felt did not respond quickly enough.\par \par \uc2 Attracting more jobs to the state is high on her agenda but Ms. Martinez was proud to let go the two personal chefs who had been working at the Governor's Mansion while Mr. Richardson lived there. Asked who prepares meals these days, she put up her hand. (In her State of the State address in January, she received laughs by saying of her husband, Chuck Franco, a longtime law enforcement officer, ''The first gentleman will just have to help out with the cooking.'')\par \par \uc2 ''She has been effective at convincing the public that she is on their side,'' said Heath Haussamen, the editor and publisher of nmpolitics.net, a political Web site.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Haussamen, who covered Ms. Martinez when she was a district attorney, said she has described herself as a ''control freak'' who enjoys hurling herself into the minutiae of politics. In that respect, she is different from Mr. Richardson, who was more prone to setting the grand vision of his administration.\par \par \uc2 Despite the contrasts, some point to similarities between the two, like their aversion to compromise. ''She digs in her heels,'' said Joe Monahan, a political analyst and blogger. In the case of Mr. Richardson, who has been on the lecture circuit since leaving office, it was his cowboy boots that were often firmly planted.\par \par \uc2 Both leaders are strong backers of New Mexico's concealed weapons law. Mr. Richardson was a gun owner and Ms. Martinez boasted on Twitter on Monday that she requalified for her concealed weapon permit and was a better shot than her husband. As evidence, she posted a video of herself at a firing range.\par \par \uc2 The two also have family ties to Mexico. Mr. Richardson's mother was Mexican, and he lived and worked in Mexico City. Ms. Martinez, who grew up along the border, is also Mexican-American, with news reports since her election revealing that her paternal grandfather came to the United States as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That fact has made it all the more difficult for some Hispanic activists to understand Ms. Martinez's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, like when she signed an executive order directing the state police to check the immigration status of all those who are arrested.\par \par \uc2 ''People ask, 'Why would someone who came from where we came from do this?' '' said Rachel LaZar, executive director of El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos, an immigrant rights group.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Martinez has pushed hard to undo Mr. Richardson's policy allowing illegal immigrants to get driver's licenses. Her initial attempt to repeal the law narrowly passed the House but failed in the Senate. She has vowed to press the matter again in a special session that begins Sept. 6.\par \par \uc2 ''I understand as a Latina not all Hispanic people are criminals,'' Ms. Martinez said of the criticism that she is out of touch with the Latino community. ''Of course. I understand that. This isn't an immigrant issue. It's a public-safety issue.''\par \par \uc2 It is also a popular issue, with public sentiment among most New Mexicans clearly with the governor, political analysts say.\par \par \uc2 As Ms. Martinez put it: ''I was elected by the state of New Mexico to do the people's business. I may be a Latina but I am governor to everyone.''\par \par \uc2 But even as often she plays down her background, the fact that she is the nation's lone Latina governor has led to talk in political circles of her strong future in the Republican Party, and maybe even as a vice-presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 ''It's very humbling,'' Ms. Martinez said of the attention, before quickly committing herself to her current job. She knows that New Mexicans grumbled when Mr. Richardson, her nemesis, spent long stints during his governorship running for president.\par \par \uc2 GOV.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 Every morning, rain or shine, Miguel used to head for the corner of Belmont and Milwaukee Avenues and wait at an informal gathering spot of day laborers in hopes he would be hired to set tile, pour concrete or lay sod.\par \par \uc2 After the job he would sometimes be paid as promised, but often he was not -- a daily risk for the thousands of workers who are hired off street corners by contractors or homeowners who need help with construction or landscaping.\par \par \uc2 Today Miguel, 48, still makes a living doing temporary construction work. But instead of braving the cold or stifling heat at a busy intersection, he meets employers at a storefront office of the Albany Park Workers' Center at Bryn Mawr and Kimball Avenues.\par \par \uc2 He starts each job with a contract specifying his pay and working conditions that a lawyer at the center will help him enforce, if necessary.\par \par \uc2 ''Here we have a roof over our head, we have coffee,'' said Miguel, who moved to Chicago from Mexico 16 years ago. ''And a contract is signed so we know we will get paid.'' (His last name is not used in this article because his immigration status is not known.)\par \par \uc2 The Albany Park Workers' Center is one of about 40 in the nation set up in an effort to reform the day-labor industry. The center, which opened in 2004, was founded and is run by the Latino Union, a group created in 2000 by immigrant women working at temporary staffing agencies. It has grown into a workers rights and immigrants rights nonprofit organization.\par \par \uc2 Some local business owners and residents oppose the workers' centers, arguing that they help in the hiring of people who are in the United States illegally, and thus encourage illegal immigration. Laborers gathered on street corners also have caused local controversies, with some neighbors complaining that they block traffic and sometimes make female passers-by uncomfortable.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  workers are especially vulnerable to unscrupulous employers. A 2006 study by the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of California, Los Angeles, found that two-thirds of day laborers surveyed in the Midwest had not been paid wages due them in the past two months, and 27 percent had been threatened with violence by employers.\par \par \uc2 Nationally, almost half of the day laborers told researchers that they had been denied breaks for food or water, and the vast majority reported being hurt on the job or left at faraway work sites without transportation home.\par \par \uc2 The Latino Union set up the storefront office in Albany Park to help combat the abuses and to persuade day laborers at street corners around the city to get jobs through workers' centers.\par \par \uc2 Eric Rodriguez, the Latino Union's executive director, said most street corners had informal networks and leaders who typically agreed on a base wage. At the corner of Milwaukee and Belmont, for example, Mr. Rodriguez said it was $12 an hour, higher than the Illinois minimum wage of $8.25 an hour.\par \par \uc2 But he said it was difficult to enforce the agreements when someone drove up looking for workers and was surrounded by men jockeying for a job.\par \par \uc2 At a workers' center, there is little jostling or bargaining for work, and the center's staff does not ask day laborers about their immigration status. Patricio Ordonez, a former day laborer turned Albany Park job coordinator, uses a lottery system to assign men to jobs and then negotiates their contracts.\par \par \uc2 ''The current broken immigration laws give predatory employers an advantage,'' said Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Newman said that illegal immigrants were reluctant to speak up if employers abused them, but that workers' centers and their lawyers were not.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rodriguez often visits other street corners and passes out pamphlets on worker rights and safety. At the Albany Park center, day laborers are offered English language classes and free workshops on construction skills, like plumbing. The center also hosts barbecues and soccer tournaments where workers from different street corners compete and then talk about improving working conditions for day laborers.\par \par \uc2 The poor economy is hurting day laborers, who face increased competition for jobs, Mr. Rodriguez said. And the anti-immigrant sentiment that often intensifies in hard economic times is evident in legislation being considered in Congress.\par \par \uc2 Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, has introduced a bill that would force workers' centers to close or greatly alter their practices. It would mandate that all employers, including workers' centers, use the government's E-Verify electronic system to validate employees' Social Security numbers.\par \par \uc2 Most legislative experts do not expect the bill to pass the Senate, but in assessing its intended impact, Tyler Moran, policy director for the National Immigration Law Center, said she did not think it would accomplish its goal of forcing day laborers to return to their native countries even if it were passed.\par \par \uc2 ''It's just going to move them from on-the-books to off-the-books,'' Ms. Moran said.\par \par \uc2 In other words, back to a street corner.\par \par \uc2 Correction: September 2, 2011, Friday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Friday about the Albany Park Workers' Center, which was set up in an effort to reform the day-labor industry, overstated what was known about the immigration status of one of the workers there. His surname was withheld because he might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , not because he is indeed here illegally.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Day workers talked to a potential employer at Belmont and Milwaukee early one July morning.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A task force set up by the Obama administration to ease political tensions over a deportation program has held the last of four public hearings, which instead served largely to galvanize vocal protests against the policy.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant, labor and church groups walked out halfway through the session Wednesday in Arlington, Va., banging drums and denouncing the hearing as a ''sham'' intended to gloss over deep problems with the program, known as Secure Communities.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant and Latino groups also marched out of hearings this month in Los Angeles and Chicago, calling for a halt to the program. In Chicago, six illegal immigrants, all students, were arrested after briefly stopping traffic outside the hearing. The students were later released. The first hearing, in Dallas, drew heated debate but less militant protests.\par \par \uc2 With a series of initiatives since June, the Obama administration has sought to tighten the focus of its deportation strategy on illegal immigrants who also have been convicted of crimes, especially serious violent and drug offenses. Officials say the rapid expansion of Secure Communities to cover the whole country by 2013 is part of that plan.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, senior administration officials announced measures last week to cancel deportation proceedings against many noncitizens who are charged with immigration violations (which generally are civil offenses), but who had not committed crimes.\par \par \uc2 A 21-member Secure Communities task force was established in June by John Morton, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency running the program, in response to resistance from states and cities. Mr. Morton assigned the group to examine narrow issues concerning the program's impact that had drawn complaints from immigrant leaders.\par \par \uc2 But the task force soon decided to hold hearings, concluding they needed to hear directly about the groundswell of discontent stirred by the program. The task force includes local law enforcement officers, immigration lawyers and representatives of immigration agents' unions.\par \par \uc2 In a letter Thursday, more than 160 immigrant rights organizations said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was a ''rogue agency,'' and they called on the members of the task force to resign.\par \par \uc2 Under Secure Communities, the fingerprints of everyone booked into jail are checked against the F.B.I.'s criminal databases -- long a routine police practice -- and also against Department of Homeland Security databases, which record immigration violations.\par \par \uc2 ''This program at its heart is about serious offenders,'' Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum and the task force's chairman, said Thursday. ''I don't think there is any question that a number of people being caught up in the system don't fit the criteria of serious offender.''\par \par \uc2 He said the hearings had revealed many episodes when detention of immigrants who were not dangerous criminals had led to mistrust of the local police, even though immigration enforcement is handled by federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wexler said the hearings had shown that ''every time someone who is not considered a serious offender is picked up and put into deportation proceedings, it undermines the credibility of the program.''\par \par \uc2 Most people who spoke at the hearings opposed the program, Mr. Wexler said, but many local law enforcement and government officials had expressed support. The task force will issue a final report in September.\par \par \uc2 In Arlington, about 150 protesters marched to the hearing on the campus of George Mason University, chanting, ''Hey, Obama, don't deport my mama.''\par \par \uc2 During the hearing, Maria Bolanos, 28, an immigrant from El Salvador, approached an immigration official sitting in the audience to confront him directly. She said she had been detained after calling the police following a fight with her partner. She has been charged with illegal sale of phone cards, she said, a charge she denied.\par \par \uc2 ''I wouldn't call the police again, and I know many people that wouldn't do the same,'' said Ms. Bolanos, who spoke in Spanish through an interpreter.\par \par \uc2 Paul Showalter, 51, an American who spoke in favor of the program, said a young \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  had been murdered in his Arlington neighborhood by another immigrant. ''So I, as a taxpayer in the State of Virginia, get to pay to house that individual for 20 years to life,'' said Mr. Showalter. ''One young man is dead, another is behind bars, because no one checked.''\par \par \uc2 A senior official from the immigration agency at the hearing said they had been surprised by the strong criticism. ''In spite of what we've been trying to do to get the word out about what Secure Communities is, we clearly are not making ourselves clear,'' said Gary Mead, a top official in charge of deportations. He said that the local police generally avoid arresting victims or witnesses of crimes.\par \par \uc2 ''If you don't get arrested, you don't get your fingerprints submitted to the F.B.I., you will never become a subject of Secure Communities,'' Mr. Mead said.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110826e78q0006o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The call came in the morning to the lawyer representing Manuel Guerra, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico living in Florida who had been caught in a tortuous and seemingly failing five-year court fight against deportation.\par \par \uc2 With the news early Thursday that federal immigration authorities had canceled his deportation, Mr. Guerra became one of the first illegal immigrants in the country to see results from a policy the Obama administration unveiled in Washington that day. It could lead to the suspension in coming months of deportation proceedings against tens of thousands of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials and immigrant advocates said Monday that the plan offered the first real possibility since President Obama took office -- promising immigrants and Latinos he would overhaul the law to bring illegal immigrants into the system -- for large numbers of those immigrants to be spared from detention and deportation.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Guerra, who said he wants to remain in the United States to study to become a Roman Catholic priest, the news ''was like something from above, from heaven. I don't want to go back to Mexico,'' he said, ''and I've been fighting this for five years.''\par \par \uc2 A working group from the Homeland Security and Justice Departments met Friday to initiate a review of about 300,000 deportation cases currently before the immigration courts. Under the policy, immigration authorities will use powers of prosecutorial discretion in existing law to suspend the deportations of most immigrants who, although they have committed immigration violations (which generally are civil offenses), have not been convicted of crimes.\par \par \uc2 In particular, officials will look to halt deportations of longtime residents with clean police records who came here illegally when they were children, or are close family of military service members, or are parents or spouses of American citizens.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a great first step,'' said Hector E. Sanchez, a Hispanic labor leader who oversees immigration policy for the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition of the country's major Latino groups. ''We really need to see action on a common-sense approach to immigration and not just promises.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama had been facing increasingly vocal protests from disappointed Latino and immigrant groups after he made no progress in Congress on his immigration overhaul agenda, and enforcement authorities set a modern record for deportations, with nearly 800,000 foreigners removed in the past two years.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security officials said Monday that their goal is to quickly identify noncriminals on swollen immigration court dockets and close those cases, clearing the way for speedier removals of gang members, drug traffickers or foreigners who repeatedly return after being deported. Wait times for a hearing in immigration courts can now be as long as 18 months.\par \par \uc2 A senior Homeland Security official said that deportations would be canceled case by case. While many immigrants in those cases will be eligible for work permits, he said, employment authorization will come only after a separate process.\par \par \uc2 The immigrants will remain in a sort of legal limbo, not vulnerable to deportation but with no positive immigration status, which can be conferred only by Congress.\par \par \uc2 But White House officials and Congressional Democrats said they expected the measures would lead to relief during the coming year for virtually all young illegal immigrants facing deportation who might have won legal status under a bill called the Dream Act. A proposal to benefit \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  high school graduates who came to the country before they were 16, it failed in the Senate last year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Guerra, now 27 and living in Indiantown, Fla., is one of those immigrants. He said he came to this country to escape a violent gang in Mexico. His lawyer, Richard A. Hujber, said Mr. Guerra's efforts to straighten out his legal status went wrong because they were originally mishandled by an accountant claiming falsely to be a lawyer.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, even though he was undocumented, Mr. Guerra has been a Florida leader of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  student movement, helping to organize a protest walk by four students to Washington and a mock university held by students wearing mortarboards on Capitol Hill.\par \par \uc2 ''That was so big to me, all these students organizing a school so we could go without our papers,'' Mr. Guerra said. If he can obtain a work permit, he and Mr. Hujber said, he could be legally eligible for the first time to apply for financial aid that would allow him to continue his religious studies.\par \par \uc2 The administration's announcement also had an immediate impact on a case in Denver, where an immigration judge on Friday postponed the deportation of Sujey Pando, a lesbian from Mexico legally married in Iowa to an American from Colorado, Violeta Pando. Although federal law does not recognize same-sex marriages, administration officials said they would consider same-sex spouses as ''family'' in their review of deportation cases.\par \par \uc2 The judge, Mimi Tsankov, cited the flux in laws and policies affecting same-sex cases in delaying a decision on Sujey Pando's deportation at least until January, said Lavi Soloway, a lawyer for the couple.\par \par \uc2 Some Latino Democrats who have been deeply critical of Mr. Obama on immigration issues praised the policy shift.\par \par \uc2 ''This is the Barack Obama I have been waiting for, that Latino and immigrant voters helped put in office to fight for sensible immigration policies,'' said Representative Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois, a Latino leader on immigration issues who has been arrested twice in protests in front of the White House.\par \par \uc2 However, the announcement appeared to signal an end to efforts by the White House to court some of its Republican opponents, with administration officials acknowledging those efforts have failed and there is little chance for broad immigration legislation to pass before elections next year.\par \par \uc2 Republican leaders reacted to Mr. Obama's new policy by stepping up their rejection of his approach. Representative Peter T. King of New York, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in the House, said the president was making ''a blatant attempt to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal aliens in this country,'' which he called ''totally unacceptable.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: In Florida, Manuel Guerra, center, has been fighting deportation for five years.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 International\par \par \uc2 WHERE CREDIT CARDS\par \par \uc2 CAN LEAD TO JAIL TERMS\par \par \uc2 For years, banks in the United Arab Emirates all but threw credit cards at the foreigners who come here in droves to work the malls and fill the office towers. The workers, many of them raised in poor countries and new to easy credit, spent beyond their means. Staggering losses followed, with jail terms common for those who could not pay. Whether cast as reckless lending or heedless borrowing, their stories offer an unusual glimpse of the hidden emotions -- webs of pride, guilt and family obligation -- that follow millions of migrants across the globe. Page 6\par \par \uc2 GOING HUNGRY FOR 5TH DAY\par \par \uc2 With his hunger strike reaching a fifth day, the Indian protest leader Anna Hazare maintained pressure on the government as his advisers demanded that their version of legislation to create a national anticorruption agency be introduced in Parliament and passed by the end of the month. Page 10\par \par \uc2 ATTACKS AVENGE BIN LADEN\par \par \uc2 One of the most powerful insurgent groups in Iraq, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, released a statement warning that it had launched a 100-attack campaign to exact revenge for the killing of Osama bin Laden. Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia has long claimed an affiliation to Bin Laden's group, and has clearly taken inspiration from the larger group. Page 10\par \par \uc2 KIM JONG-IL VISITS RUSSIA\par \par \uc2 In his first visit to Russia in nearly a decade, Kim Jong-Il, the reclusive leader of North Korea, rumbled across the border into far eastern Russia aboard an armored train amid growing hopes for a resumption of talks over ending his country's nuclear weapons program. The Kremlin released a terse statement saying the North Korean leader would visit sites in Russia's Far East and Siberia, as well as meet with Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev. Page 10\par \par \uc2 National\par \par \uc2 FEARS THAT FARMERS' MARKETS\par \par \uc2 HAVE OUTSTRIPPED DEMAND\par \par \uc2 Farmers in pockets of the country say the growing number of farmers' markets has outstripped demand, a consequence of a clamor for markets that are closer to customers and communities that want multiple markets. Some farmers say small new markets have lured away loyal customers, while other say they must add markets to their weekly rotation to earn the same money they did a few years ago. Page 11\par \par \uc2 A SHIFT AT CATHOLIC HOSPITALS\par \par \uc2 Nuns or priests serve as chief executives at only 8 of 636 Catholic hospitals, according to the Catholic Health Association, illustrating the transition of Catholic health care from religious to lay leadership. The shift has caused angst in many Catholic hospitals about whether the values imparted by the nuns, concerning the treatment of both patients and employees, can withstand bottom-line forces without their day-to-day vigilance. Page 11\par \par \uc2 GIFFORDS GIVEN DETAILS\par \par \uc2 Representative Gabrielle Giffords is now aware of who was killed during the January shooting rampage in Tucson that left her seriously wounded, receiving the news just days before her surprise Aug. 1 appearance on Capitol Hill to vote on the federal debt ceiling, her spokesman said. Page 16\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 SCOURING THE CITY\par \par \uc2 FOR CHARACTERS TO PLAY\par \par \uc2 The playwright and performer Sarah Jones, 37, who won a Tony Award in 2006 for her show ''Bridge and Tunnel,'' might be described as an unlicensed anthropologist, an explorer of the cultural fault lines that unite and divide the city. She scours the streets of New York looking for inspiration for her next show, for which she received a commission from Lincoln Center to perform. Page 17\par \par \uc2 Sports\par \par \uc2 WITH EACH VICTORY,\par \par \uc2 DETROIT PUTS PAST BEHIND\par \par \uc2 With six teams -- Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Atlanta, Boston, Texas and the Yankees -- cruising through the regular season, the tightest pennant race in baseball is taking place in the American League Central, where the Detroit Tigers lead the Cleveland Indians by two and a half games. The Tigers, who have not had a winning record after the All-Star break since losing the 2006 World Series, look to bury the past with each win. On Baseball, Tyler Kepner. Page 3\par \par \uc2 GOING BEYOND MONEY\par \par \uc2 In what could become the first concussion-related class-action against the N.F.L., a group of former players -- including two players who retired within the past two years -- is seeking monetary damages for injured players as well as changes in the medical monitoring of players, an action experts say may push boundaries in both law and science. Page 5\par \par \uc2 REFLECTING ON MARIS'S 61\par \par \uc2 This season marks the 50th anniversary of Roger Maris's 61 home runs, an accomplishment that gets better with time. Maris played in an era that had not discovered the healing and enhancement properties of anabolic steroids that were banned by federal law and baseball edict by the late 1990s. As a result, people look at Maris and Ruth and Henry Aaron in a different way from more recent sluggers. Sports of the Times, George Vecsey. Page 2\par \par \uc2 Obituaries\par \par \uc2 CLAIR GEORGE, 81\par \par \uc2 The Central Intelligence Agency's deputy director of operations for three years of the Reagan administration, Clair George was a consummate spymaster who moved the chess pieces in the C.I.A.'s clandestine games of intrigue before being convicted of lying to Congress about the Iran-contra affair. Page 20\par \par \uc2 Sunday Business\par \par \uc2 INTERNET STOCK ANALYSTS,\par \par \uc2 IN FASHION ONCE MORE\par \par \uc2 The market's gyrations notwithstanding, Internet stock analysts are again in style. In some cases, investment houses are fighting over these rising stars, bidding up their pay. Not since those heady days of the Nasdaq stock market bubble has working as a technology analyst seemed so, well, sexy. Page 1\par \par \uc2 TECH ADS ON THE RADIO\par \par \uc2 Information technology products, like e-mail archivers and Web site security software, are increasingly being promoted on the radio -- not just in major cities but also in smallish ones like Redding, Calif., or Bend, Ore. The economics of radio advertising sometimes make it useful in reaching small but important groups of prospective customers. Page 3\par \par \uc2 U.S. STILL BEHIND ON PRIVACY\par \par \uc2 Even as Congress and agencies like the Federal Trade Commission propose new privacy measures, it turns out that the United States still lags behind Europe in ensuring some controls. And Europeans are hotly debating whether to do more.\par \par \uc2 Page 3\par \par \uc2 COMPANIES SPEND ANYWAY\par \par \uc2 Even if they aren't creating many more jobs, companies are using some of their cash to bolster dividends and to make acquisitions.

For many middle-aged buyers, the runaway trend is the ''four-door coupe,'' cars like the Audi A7 or the redesigned Mercedes-Benz CLS550.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 You can learn a lot about a man by the way he disembowels an avocado.\par \par \uc2 Demian Bichir, the Mexican film star, stood in my kitchen at lunchtime testing the pile of avocados on the counter. He wanted to make guacamole the way he used to as a busboy at Rosa Mexicano in the 1980s, during his first sustained lap as an actor in the United States. Instead of a contrived lunch date at a restaurant, digital recorders whirring, he decided to come over to my apartment with a bottle of Patron tequila and his hands ready for cooking.\par \par \uc2 I had prepared the molcajete, the traditional Mexican version of a mortar and pestle, and gathered the onions, cilantro, tomatoes, jalapenos, avocados and habaneros. (''Habaneros?'' he said. ''If you want to kill somebody.'') I stashed the tequila in the freezer.\par \par \uc2 ''This one doesn't feel right,'' he said, touching an avocado's papery skin. ''But this guy, and this guy'' - he reached for another and, squinting, palmed the fruit as gently as if it were a bird's egg ready to hatch - ''and this guy are perfect.'' Within a second, a six-inch Wusthof cook's knife had sliced the avocado in half and Bichir, looking into my eyes, brought down the knife into the palm of his hand with a thwap.\par \par \uc2 Oh, God. Do we call an ambulance?\par \par \uc2 No. Locking the pit onto the blade of the knife, he worked it free in a deft corkscrew motion, accompanying his Kabuki with sound effects. ''Poom, poom, poom. Whish.'' He cross-hatched each side - ''pap, pap, pap'' - and spooned out the perfect square chunks into the molcajete.\par \par \uc2 Delicacy, precision, startling force: these are qualities that defined Bichir's performance in ''A Better Life,'' a remarkable film that has cemented his reputation as a formidable talent in Hollywood. A household name in Mexico for two decades, he has become familiar to American audiences in recent years as Fidel Castro in Steven Soderbergh's ''Che'' and as the brutally handsome, morally Manichean mayor of Tijuana and husband to Mary-Louise Parker in Showtime's totally twisted, insanely entertaining Emmy-winning series ''Weeds.''\par \par \uc2 The son of a Mexican theater director and an actress, Bichir is one of three acting brothers - Odiseo, Demian and Bruno- so famous for their prolific output that in 2003 the Mexican MTV Movie Awards created the category ''Best Bichir in a Movie.'' (Demian won.) He grew up in the barrios of Mexico City, poor but surrounded by books. ''My parents met in the theater, and they grew up loving theater, and when my brothers and I decided to become actors, we had all we needed in our library at home,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In ''A Better Life,'' Bichir is Carlos Galindo, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico who scrapes out an existence as a gardener, peering in at an American dream of swimming pools, housekeepers and big cars in the Hollywood Hills. When Carlos's sister lends him enough money to buy a truck, which would catapult him from day laborer to gardening boss, he hesitates: she hasn't told her husband she has taken the money out of their savings account. And there is so much more at stake. Carlos has no driver's license, so being pulled over means instant arrest, deportation and separation from his son, whom he has raised as a single father.\par \par \uc2 He buys the truck; the next day, in an act of insidious betrayal, it is stolen. One of the tougher scenes to watch is one in which Carlos stands on a busy street, his work clothes briny with sweat, his eyes fruitlessly searching the traffic for his truck - the dream that will rescue him and his child from their gang-controlled East L.A. barrio, that will allow them to live in a house with more than one bed and one sofa. His eyes alight on a police officer, yet he can't ask for help. In Bichir's face, we see that Carlos knows his situation is utterly futile, and he and his child are vulnerable. The sense of despair and desperation is all-encompassing.\par \par \uc2 Bichir calls it one of the most important works of his career, ''and for an actor,'' he added, ''the character of Carlos Galindo has the same dimension and depth as Lear or Hamlet - it's that powerful.'' When he first met with Chris Weitz - whose grandmother Lupita Tovar was perhaps Mexico's most famous actress - the director told Bichir that he was not going to make an overtly political film, but that he would set out to present a simple, powerful story that happened to have as one of its themes the Mexican immigrant experience.\par \par \uc2 ''I didn't see any gimmicks, any Hollywood tricks,'' Bichir said. ''I need to be moved and for something to speak to me truthfully.''\par \par \uc2 While the movie is political, certainly, Weitz (director of ''About a Boy,'' ''The Golden Compass'' and ''The Twilight Saga: New Moon'') chose to tell the story of Carlos Galindo as a piece of social realism, rather than as political propaganda. However, as Weitz told me, ''the moment you train a camera on someone, especially a film camera, you say they are worthy of being paid attention to, and it elicits sympathy. In that regard, the film is political by default.'' But he chose not to push that button too hard and risk ''turning Carlos into a symbol rather than a closely observed character,'' he said. In that sense, ''A Better Life'' is a story about the delicate relationship between a father and son, about loss of culture, about isolation, about the spiritual lives of two nations.\par \par \uc2 Bichir moved to New York when he was 22. ''My mother said, 'What? You can't move there! They shoot people at 2 o'clock in the afternoon! Oh my God!' '' He auditioned at Lee Strasberg and was told he was already an actor and he should save the $5,000 tuition. ''And that's when I stopped acting,'' he said. ''I wanted to give my actor a break. I wanted to live and to learn English. I wanted to be anything, a cabdriver, a busboy, anything to keep me away from acting for a while.''\par \par \uc2 Thus, his stretch as a busboy at Rosa Mexicano, where his job included making guacamole in front of each customer's table. ''I think I still hold the record for making 39 guacamoles in one lunch,'' he said. Then on to Los Angeles, where he spent four years going on auditions and trying to land a role. ''Nothing happened,'' he said. ''It was hard, really hard.'' When he was offered a role in ''Hasta Morir,'' he took it, returning to Mexico, where he won an Ariel, the Mexican equivalent of an Oscar.\par \par \uc2 In Mexico, he worked all the time. ''And then one day, I was about 41, and I pictured my life,'' he said. ''Soon, I would be living in a house with a big swimming pool, drinking a bloody mary and thinking, what if I had tried a little harder? Been a little more adventurous? Tried a little longer?'' Divorced, with no attachments, he moved back to L.A. ''Something had fundamentally changed in me, in my hard drive.''\par \par \uc2 While serving on the jury at the Ibiza Film Festival, he got a call at 5 in the morning from Steven Soderbergh, who asked him to play Castro in his biopic about Che Guevara. ''And that was when it all began,'' he said. ''That was when everything changed.''\par \par \uc2 I first met Bichir before a screening of ''A Better Life'' in New York. Slender, animated, almost impish, his green eyes alight, he reminded me of a self-effacing Fred Astaire. ''I'm writing a serious piece about you,'' I said. ''Because I'm - such--- a serious actor?'' Each word dropped with a beat of expert comic timing, as if to say: I. Am. Not. A. Serious. Actor. Lady. Get. A. Life.\par \par \uc2 As the film began, I couldn't place the man I had just met on the screen. The wiry, bright-eyed comic in the lobby was replaced by a heavyset man whose face had been eaten away by weariness and fear, his eyes dull, the barest flicker of light left in them to suggest his soul was still alive way down inside.\par \par \uc2 Bichir is somewhat of a Method actor: he immersed himself in a life like Galindo's by driving a gardener's truck - which he bought off the street from some paisanos - wearing the same unwashed clothes for days, sleeping four hours a night. One of the film's producers told me that two Mexicans spotted Bichir in L.A., in his gardener's truck and shook their heads, saying, ''Look, man! That's Demian Bichir. He's sure fallen on hard times.''\par \par \uc2 Yet he has such a light, comic gift, it was hard to watch him make guacamole and think that this was the same man who so brilliantly captured Castro's threatening physicality, the curlicued accent, the voice veering from thunderous to almost ethereal, the powder-keg personality. Difficult to imagine this funny guy dancing salsa in my kitchen to Akwid's ''California'' (a song from the soundtrack to ''A Better Life'') as the gangster mayor who orders murders and makes a point to his pregnant girlfriend by basically raping her over his desk.\par \par \uc2 ''It is extraordinary, Demian's vitality in contrast to the performance he gives,'' Weitz said. ''All of the energy goes underground.'' Benicio del Toro, who worked with Bichir on ''Che,'' describes him as one of the strongest actors he's worked with. For the part of Castro, del Toro said, Soderbergh ''needed someone who was strong but not someone who looked like he was acting strong. And that is kind of hard to find. Pacino can be strong without acting strong. Hoffman, too. Bichir has that quality, that gravitas.''\par \par \uc2 ''We all have that capacity, to be two things,'' Bichir said. ''And after all I was named for both the devil and the angel. Demonio y angel. Dem-y-an.'' (His parents took his name from the Herman Hesse novel ''Demian: The Story of Emil Sinclair's Youth.'')\par \par \uc2 Oliver Stone was drawn to the demonic side, and cast Bichir as a huckster in his next movie, ''Savages,'' based on a Don Winslow novel about pot growers and Mexican drug cartels. ''He can play heavy,'' Stone said, adding that ''all he needs is one big role as a narcotraficante and if he hits that note just right he will have a worldwide reputation in a second.''\par \par \uc2 Mary-Louise Parker, who played his lover and then wife on ''Weeds,'' also believes he plays good guys, like Carlos Galindo, with an almost sacred perfection. ''I might use a word that sounds pretentious, but his performance was almost holy,'' she said. ''It was beyond being just about depth. He made the film into a Greek tragedy. And he is one of the few actors I know who could make that part humane.'' And this from a woman who broke her toe during their first, unexpectedly vigorous love scene. ''He is pretty delicious,'' she added.\par \par \uc2 Bichir is dating but admits he is ''really bad at long-term commitments.'' He did become a father in May; the child is the product of a brief - ''and beautiful, please, beautiful, beautiful'' - romance in Spain last year. ''I try to be as clear as I can be,'' he said. ''I don't hide or play stupid games. I try to let everyone know that eventually I will probably be leaving.'' In this case, a couple of months after his leave-taking, he got an e-mail informing him he would be a father. Bichir attended the baby's birth, and she has his surname. ''I decided to be there and not run away from the situation. I am her father, and I will love her forever,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 At 48, Bichir feels as if he has experienced a kind of rebirth. ''It is a before-and-after moment, for sure,'' he said. After the meal and almost an entire bottle of tequila, we were looking out at the city. It was late afternoon. His roles as Castro, as Carlos Galindo and as Miguel Hidalgo in a Mexican production out this year about the country's founder, are the work he is proudest of. ''It would be sad,'' he said, ''if my best work had been 20 years ago and now I only had memories.''\par \par \uc2 He also makes great guacamole.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Method man: Opposite: Demian Bichir in MacArthur Park, Los Angeles.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 CULLMAN, Ala. -- On a sofa in the hallway of his office here, Mitchell Williams, the pastor of First United Methodist Church, announced that he was going to break the law. He is not the only church leader making such a declaration these days.\par \par \uc2 Since June, when Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, signed an immigration enforcement law called the toughest in the country by critics and supporters alike, the opposition has been vocal and unceasing.\par \par \uc2 Thousands of protesters have marched. Anxious farmers and contractors have personally confronted their lawmakers. The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups have sued, and have been backed by a list of groups including teachers' unions and 16 foreign countries. Several county sheriffs, who will have to enforce parts of the new law, have filed affidavits supporting the legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 On Aug. 1, the Justice Department joined the fray, contending, as in a similar suit in Arizona, that the state law pre-empts federal authority to administer and enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 And on that same day, four bishops sued.\par \par \uc2 An Episcopal bishop, a Methodist bishop and a Roman Catholic archbishop and bishop, all based in Alabama, sued on the basis that the new statute violated their right to free exercise of religion, arguing that it would ''make it a crime to follow God's command to be Good Samaritans.''\par \par \uc2 ''The law,'' said Archbishop Thomas J. Rodi of Mobile, ''attacks our core understanding of what it means to be a church.''\par \par \uc2 While church leaders have spoken out against similar laws elsewhere, Alabama is the only state where senior church leaders have gone so far in formal, organized opposition. But the law in Alabama, a state with an estimated 120,000 illegal immigrants, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, goes further than any other.\par \par \uc2 It contains some of the controversial provisions of other recent state laws, including one that empowers local law enforcement to try to ascertain immigration status after pulling people over for traffic violations.\par \par \uc2 But the law also makes it a crime to transport, harbor or rent property to people who are known to be in the country illegally, and it renders any contracts with illegal immigrants null.\par \par \uc2 To some church leaders -- who say they will not be able to give people rides, invite them to worship services or perform marriages and baptisms -- the law essentially criminalizes basic parts of Christian ministry.\par \par \uc2 Framers of the law say this is broadly exaggerated. The provisions, they say, clearly pertain to human traffickers or employers actively seeking to skirt the law. Churches, or people simply acting as Good Samaritans, were not intended as targets of the law, they say, nor would they be singled out in practice.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not as explicit as the churches would obviously like,'' said State Senator Bryan Taylor, a Republican. ''But I do not think that any church or any clergyman is subject to prosecution for doing their Christian mission.''\par \par \uc2 Transporting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , lawmakers point out, is considered a crime under the law if it is done ''in furtherance of the unlawful presence'' of the person in the United States. ''Harboring'' an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is a crime only if it is done to shield the person from detection.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the church leaders contend that the language is far too vague to rely on such reassurances.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Alabama's attorney general asked the State Supreme Court to interpret the passages raised in the church lawsuit, which has been consolidated with two other suits, including the one brought by the Justice Department.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the denominations represented in the suit are not the only ones with concerns.\par \par \uc2 An ecumenical group of ministers in Auburn has publicly condemned the law. Bob Terry, the president of The Alabama Baptist newspaper, wrote in a column that the state was trying to dictate Christian ministry.\par \par \uc2 Andy Heis, the pastor of the new, nondenominational Desperation Church in Cullman, said, ''It puts you in a really, really hard place.''\par \par \uc2 ''I understand legally where they're coming from,'' he said, pointing out that obeying government laws was a biblical command. ''But spiritually, I have to do what God calls me to do.''\par \par \uc2 The politics of this are unusual, with those opposed to the law, mostly coming from the left, arguing that the statute falls short of biblical principles, and the law's supporters, mostly from the right, arguing that secular laws and biblical law cannot always run on the same track.\par \par \uc2 And the politics are thorny for ministers, who acknowledge that the immigration law is broadly popular. Congregations are not in lock step behind their leaders.\par \par \uc2 Take Mac Buttram, a retired Methodist minister and a Republican who represents Cullman in the Legislature and voted for the law. Like other lawmakers, he insists that many of the law's opponents misunderstand or exaggerate what it says.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Buttram also said he was surprised by comments from church leaders, including his own bishop, implying that those who supported the law were being mean-spirited and un-Christian.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a Christian issue, it's a moral issue, but it's not an issue in which we should be casting judgment,'' he said, adding that several Methodist ministers had since called him expressing their support for the law.\par \par \uc2 State Representative Micky Hammon, a Republican and one of the law's sponsors, said some church leaders had asked that a passage be included in the law that would exempt churches from certain provisions. But every attempt at writing such a passage ended up creating an unacceptably large loophole, he said, adding that any necessary adjustments to the law could still be made.\par \par \uc2 For some church leaders, the issue cannot be cut free of the weight of Alabama history.\par \par \uc2 The need for language forbidding racial profiling and the frequent failure by those discussing the law to distinguish between illegal immigrants and Hispanics in general give pause to opponents, even if they agree that current federal immigration policy is not working.\par \par \uc2 ''Alabama needs to sit this one out,'' said Bishop William H. Willimon, a Methodist who serves North Alabama. ''The civil rights memorial in Birmingham is kind of a reminder that we've got to watch this sort of thing.''\par \par \uc2 An open letter to the governor and the law's legislative sponsors, written by two Methodist ministers and signed by more than 150 other ministers, begins with a reference to the 1963 Letter From a Birmingham Jail by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in which the civil rights leader rebuked liberal religious leaders, among them the predecessors of those who brought the lawsuit, for urging restraint in the fight against segregation.\par \par \uc2 The authors of the letter said they did not feel that they were making up for the clerical restraint during the civil rights years, but were simply drawing attention to Dr. King's thoughts on unjust laws.\par \par \uc2 ''King was saying context doesn't matter -- if it's unjust, it's unjust, and you call it like you see it,'' said the Rev. Matt Lacey, whose Birmingham church was attended in the 1960s by Bull Connor, the city's police chief and lead enforcer of segregation laws.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Williams, the pastor in Cullman, signed the letter but is less confrontational than some of his fellow ministers. For one thing, he thinks the church needs to be careful on how it speaks.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think that the church can stand up and say a particular law is Christian or not,'' he said. Still, he said, he has told his ministers to keep doing what they are doing, including the church's active Hispanic ministry, whether the law is upheld or not.\par \par \uc2 Correction: August 21, 2011, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about church leaders' denouncing Alabama's new immigration enforcement law misstated the number of bishops who sued, arguing that the new statute would ''make it a crime to follow God's command to be Good Samaritans.'' It was four, not three.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: The Rev. Mitchell Williams and more than 150 other ministers signed a letter denouncing Alabama's new immigration law.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON -- Mayor Thomas Menino, who often invokes his heritage as the grandson of an Italian immigrant, was one of the first local leaders in the country to embrace a federal program intended to improve community safety by deporting dangerous immigrant criminals.\par \par \uc2 But five years after Boston became a testing ground for the fingerprinting program, known as Secure Communities, Mr. Menino is one of the latest local officials to sour on it and seek to withdraw. He found that many immigrants the program deported from Boston, though here illegally, had committed no crimes. The mayor believed it was eroding hard-earned ties between Boston's police force and its melting-pot mix of ethnic neighborhoods.\par \par \uc2 Last month, Mr. Menino sent a letter to the program with a blunt assessment. ''Secure Communities is negatively impacting public safety,'' he wrote, asking how Boston could get out.\par \par \uc2 On Aug. 5, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which runs the program, gave an equally blunt response. Its director, John Morton, announced he was canceling all agreements that 40 states and cities had signed to start Secure Communities. Their assent was not legally required, he said, and he planned to move ahead anyway to extend the program nationwide by 2013.\par \par \uc2 So Boston's mayor, together with a growing number of other state and local officials, is stuck.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Menino's disenchantment illustrates the widening resistance from cities and states that is troubling one of President Obama's most far-reaching programs to toughen enforcement against illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials are pressing ahead, saying that information-sharing laws passed after the Sept. 11 attacks mandate the program. The clash will gain a higher profile this month, when a task force Mr. Morton named to recommend fixes is to hold public hearings in a half-dozen cities.\par \par \uc2 In an interview, Mr. Menino was alternately worried and indignant about the program.\par \par \uc2 ''We need those community folks to tell us what is going on out there,'' said the mayor, a Democrat who has run Boston for 18 years. As a result of Secure Communities, he said, word is out in Boston that patrol officers are working with federal agents to deport immigrants for offenses as minor as traffic violations.\par \par \uc2 ''What's happening is, we're losing the trust of the immigrant community in Boston,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Obama administration officials vigorously defend Secure Communities, saying it is essential for identifying immigrant gang members and other violent criminals arrested by the local police, so federal agents can focus on deporting them. Officials say they are taking steps to avoid deporting foreigners detained for immigration violations, which generally are civil, not criminal, offenses.\par \par \uc2 In a July 25 letter defending his strategy, Mr. Obama said that deportations of convicted criminals over all increased by 70 percent in 2010 over 2008, while the share of noncriminals among deportees was declining. ''The increase in the proportion of criminal removals demonstrates that this strategy is having a real impact,'' the president wrote.\par \par \uc2 Under Secure Communities, the fingerprints of anyone booked into jail are checked against the F.B.I.'s criminal databases -- long a routine police practice -- and forwarded to the Department of Homeland Security to be run through its databases, which record immigration violations. If an immigration check yields a match, the immigration agency decides whether to detain the foreigner for deportation.\par \par \uc2 After several pilot projects like the one Boston started in 2006, the agency formally inaugurated Secure Communities in Houston in October 2008. It quickly expanded, with little fanfare or protest, to about 1,500 counties or other jurisdictions, about half the 3,181 jurisdictions in the nation.\par \par \uc2 But this year three governors -- including Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, as well as Pat Quinn of Illinois and Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, all Democrats -- announced that they wanted to pull out, as did officials in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and more than 200 immigrant groups have asked Mr. Obama to suspend the program.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Morton has addressed some complaints. In June, he issued new guidelines giving immigration agents broad discretion to halt deportations of noncriminal illegal immigrants. He traveled to places of dissent, including Boston, working to eliminate confusion -- which he acknowledged the immigration agency had created -- over whether jurisdictions could opt out.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Morton set up the task force, which includes police chiefs, immigration lawyers and representatives of immigration agent unions. Its chairman, Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said the group quickly set aside Mr. Morton's assignment to deliver recommendations in 45 days. Its first hearing was this week in Dallas; others scheduled so far will be in Los Angeles; Chicago; Arlington, Va.; and Boston.\par \par \uc2 In Boston, where about 200,000 immigrants make up one-quarter of the population, Mr. Menino said he was originally attracted to Secure Communities because immigrant leaders liked the sound of it. ''A person with a homicide or major crime, immigrants don't want them in their community either,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Problems started earlier this year when advocacy groups released immigration data showing that more than half of 313 immigrants deported from Boston under the program had no criminal convictions. Many had been detained in traffic stops.\par \par \uc2 Boston's police commissioner, Edward Davis, had been a Secure Communities supporter, because his records showed that it had removed many violent criminal immigrants from Boston jails. But he concluded from the new figures that immigration officials had misled him.\par \par \uc2 They specifically told us they would not be removing people with traffic offenses,'' Mr. Davis said. ''They said they wouldn't and now they have.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Davis said he was taken aback by the indifference of immigration officials to his questions. ''This is a throwback to the bad old days of the federal agencies before 9/11, when we did not have cooperation,'' he said. ''It is really disconcerting that they are not at all concerned about our precarious situation with immigrant communities.''\par \par \uc2 At the end of the school year, Mr. Menino held a lunch for about 30 valedictorians graduating from Boston high schools. He discovered that six of the city's highest-ranking students were illegal immigrants. Then he began to hear stories of immigrants snared by Secure Communities.\par \par \uc2 One was Leonardo Machado, 35, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and a construction worker from Brazil who was stopped by a traffic officer because a rear brake light was out. He did not have a valid driver's license. Immigration agents went to traffic court and led him away in ankle and foot chains.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Machado agreed to leave for Brazil, along with his Brazilian wife and 5-year-old-son, a Boston-born American citizen. ''I am not fighting against the laws,'' Mr. Machado said as he prepared his departure. ''But I am not a criminal, and my wife and my little son are not criminals. They did not have to humiliate us like that.''\par \par \uc2 Heloisa Galvao, executive director of the Brazilian Women's Group here, said: ''People listen to these stories. Lately the people are scared of the police because they think the police are involved in immigration.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Menino said a July 7 meeting he held with immigrant leaders had persuaded him to try to cancel the program. He did not hide his anger when immigration officials said it would continue.\par \par \uc2 ''People will start to say the police are gestapos,'' the mayor said. ''My police aren't gestapos. You can't be a bureaucrat in Washington and just say, 'We don't care.' ''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Police Commissioner Edward Davis, left, and Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston oppose the Secure Communities program.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In San Francisco, where bicycle commuters often wear full-body spandex suits, my patient Carlos could easily be spotted: the Mexican man in mustard-colored work boots and painter's overalls stained with gear grease, furiously pedaling an adolescent's red Huffy.\par \par \uc2 He was the only patient I've ever had who rode a bike to his medical appointments, making his way from the docks under the Bay Bridge to our roving clinic about three miles across town. Our clinic for uninsured patients like Carlos was actually a converted cargo van that drove the back alleys of the city, stopping behind big-box stores and beneath bridges to repair cuts and scrapes among the city's homeless population.\par \par \uc2 We saw Carlos arrive in the van's rear-view mirror. He would pant while locking his bike to the bumper, then wipe sweat off his upper lip and compose himself, extending a firm handshake to our nurse. I saw him so often with his helmet on that it was not until our third visit that I realized he was nearly bald.\par \par \uc2 What I had noticed, though, was a growth the size of a golf ball emerging above his left clavicle that had begun to press on his airway, causing him to wheeze. ''I come here as fast as I can,'' he would say every time, apologizing for how long it took to ascend San Francisco's hills.\par \par \uc2 Carlos propped himself up on the exam table in the back of the van as our nurse rushed back and forth between the steering wheel and the filing cabinets of medical paperwork chained to the walls. In a normal doctor's office, each of Carlos's visits would have been carefully documented in a folder labeled with his last name in block letters, slipped into a wall of manila patient records.\par \par \uc2 But here, we stapled the sheets together and slid them into an envelope at the back of a cabinet labeled ''Undocumented.''\par \par \uc2 Unlike most of our other patients, Carlos didn't have any identification. He gladly paid out of pocket for ointments and creams for incidental cuts and bruises. But what he really needed was a biopsy, a $200 procedure that, given the location of the mass in his neck, could not be done safely in the back of a van.\par \par \uc2 We could find no medical office willing to schedule an appointment for a man without identification. One private hospital sent us a typed note: ''This unfortunate gentleman will not be eligible for services here.''\par \par \uc2 We told Carlos to go to the emergency room of the public hospital, San Francisco General. He was not yet sick enough to be formally admitted, though, so he sat on a gurney for six hours and was charged $1,085 for a bag of intravenous salt water he didn't really need. He was passed a note instructing him to ''follow up with your primary care provider.''\par \par \uc2 The hospital eventually gave him an appointment for a biopsy; it was scheduled in five months and three weeks. Carlos kept the yellow appointment slip in the front pocket of his overalls. He would bike with it; his sweat stained the paper until the edges wore thin.\par \par \uc2 ''I will not miss this,'' he said whenever we reminded him of the date. As a temporizing show of support before his biopsy, we would see him every Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. He would roll in, wheezing, but would smile after a brief breathing treatment or 15 minutes with a heating pad on his shoulder.\par \par \uc2 During those early weeks of September, the health care debates raged on television. We watched as President Obama told Congress that illegal immigrants would not get health care coverage. We heard someone yell, ''You lie!''\par \par \uc2 On any given day, the bodies of illegal immigrants lie in San Francisco's coroner's office, found by police or firefighters in alleys or on sidewalks, unclaimed and unnamed.\par \par \uc2 Before they died, their medical costs may well have been passed on to taxpayers. But it's also true that many were taxpayers themselves. From 2000 to 2005, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers paid an estimated $6 billion to $7 billion in Social Security taxes and about $1.5 billion to Medicare, according to the Social Security Administration. And the president's Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that illegal immigrants pay $80,000 more in taxes per person than they consume in government benefits over their lifetimes.\par \par \uc2 The question of whether to insure Carlos and others like him is really a decision about whether to pay now or later -- that is, to pay for preventive medical care now, or to pay in the future for hospital and emergency services, or for the internment of unclaimed bodies.\par \par \uc2 Carlos stopped coming to his appointments. Our driver would wait an extra 30 minutes for him to reappear, brushing off demands from traffic cops to make way for the evening restaurant crowd. Weeks passed. Carlos's friends from the docks approached the van, wondering if we had seen him.\par \par \uc2 Early one morning, a clerk at the public hospital handed me a message. Carlos's red bike had turned up at a police auction. Sold, for $32.\par \par \uc2 I fear the growth in his throat may have been cancer, that it may have killed him. The coroner's office cannot tell us, but it would not be that surprising, really. At the age of 50, Carlos already had surpassed by an entire year the average life expectancy of a migrant laborer in the United States.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY TIM LANE)\par \par \uc2 Dr. Sanjay Basu is a resident in internal medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.

Bill to Require Verification of Workers' Immigration Status\b0\par\par\uc2 By JESSE McKINLEY and JULIA PRESTON; Jesse McKinley reported from Patterson, Calif., and Julia Preston from New York.   \par \uc2 1,394 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 July 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PATTERSON, Calif. -- Farmers across the country are rallying to fight a Republican-sponsored bill that would force them and all other employers to verify the legal immigration status of their workers, a move some say could imperil not only future harvests but also the agricultural community's traditional support for conservative candidates.\par \par \uc2 The bill was proposed by Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. It would require farmers -- who have long relied on a labor force of immigrants, a majority here without legal documents -- to check all new hires through E-Verify, a federal database run by the Department of Homeland Security devised to ferret out illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Farm laborers, required like other workers to show that they are authorized to take jobs in the United States, often present Social Security numbers and some form of picture ID. Employers, many of them labor contractors providing crews to farms, have not been required to check the information and are discouraged by antidiscrimination laws from looking at it too closely. But it is an open secret that many farmworkers' documents are false.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of E-Verify, an electronic system that is currently mandatory for most federal contractors but voluntary for other employers, argue that it would eliminate any doubt about workers' legal status. But farmers say it could cripple a $390 billion industry that relies on hundreds of thousands of willing, low-wage immigrant workers to pick, sort and package everything from avocados to zucchini.\par \par \uc2 ''This would be an emergency, a dire, dire situation,'' said Nancy Foster, president of the U.S. Apple Association, adding that the prospect of an E-Verify check would most likely mean that many immigrant workers would simply not show up. ''We will end up closing down.''\par \par \uc2 That sentiment is echoed by growers like George Bonacich, an 81-year-old apricot farmer who has been working the same patch of land in Patterson, 80 miles east of San Francisco, since 1969.\par \par \uc2 This year, Mr. Bonacich employed up to 100 farmhands to pick a total of 50 to 100 tons each day, often in triple-digit heat. He speaks passionately about his employees -- ''They're good people, hard-working,'' he said -- and plainly about what would happen if E-Verify were to become the law of the farmland.\par \par \uc2 ''If we don't have enough labor at peak time, the fruit goes on the ground,'' he said. ''The fruit will only stay on the tree so long.''\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Smith's bill seems to have a good chance of passing the House, the Senate, controlled by Democrats, appears more skeptical. Democrats have said they will point to a Congressional Budget Office report on a similar bill that concluded it would cost the federal government $22 billion over a decade, from lost tax revenues now collected from the paychecks of illegal immigrants ineligible for services.\par \par \uc2 In a May letter to the members of the Judiciary Committee, Bob Stallman, the president of the American Farm Bureau, cited a Labor Department survey placing the percentage of illegal workers in the fields at more than 50 percent. Other groups say the figure is closer to 70 percent. Denying farmers that labor supply, Mr. Stallman wrote, would cost them $5 billion to $9 billion annually.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith's bill has attracted more solid support from nonagricultural business leaders, opening a divide between them and agricultural interests. Many nonfarm businesses have concluded that some form of employee verification is inevitable.\par \par \uc2 National organizations of restaurant owners and home builders gave their backing. The San Antonio Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which unites Latino businesses in Mr. Smith's district that have often been at odds with him, is leaning toward endorsing the bill, said Ramiro A. Cavazos, the president of the chamber.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Smith, whose district includes parts of suburban San Antonio and Austin as well as a large part of the nearby Hill Country, recently acknowledged the surge of worry in rural areas. He said he would soon introduce a separate bill to ''address the needs of the agriculture industry,'' either proposing changes to the current federal temporary farm worker program, known as H-2A, or offering a new guest worker program.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith's E-Verify bill also includes a three-year grace period before growers would have to comply. But such caveats have done little to quell opposition from farm groups, who have been pleading for years for an overhaul to allow a legal immigrant work force.\par \par \uc2 And that discontent could manifest itself in elections, farm representatives warn.\par \par \uc2 ''Most of our folks are Republicans,'' said Paul Wenger, the president of the California Farm Bureau. ''But if the Republicans do this to them without a workable worker program, it will change their voting patterns or at very least their involvement in politics.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith said requiring employers to determine that new hires were eligible to work would prevent illegal immigrants from taking jobs at a time of high joblessness for Americans. ''We could open up millions of jobs for unemployed Americans and legal workers,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 But farmers and their advocates scoff at that notion, saying that regardless of high unemployment, few American workers are willing to sign up for what are often hard, hot and long hours in the fields.\par \par \uc2 ''People just don't want to do farm work,'' Mr. Wenger said. ''They don't want to pick berries. They don't want to pick lettuce. And the pay is just as good as working at the hamburger shop or making up hotel rooms, but they just don't want to do the work.''\par \par \uc2 Mike Carlton, director of labor relations for the Florida Fruit and Vegetables Association, agreed. He said his group monitored hiring by citrus growers, who are required to offer jobs to Americans before they can turn to the H-2A program for temporary foreign laborers.\par \par \uc2 In one sample, Mr. Carlton said, 344 Americans came forward to fill 1,800 pickers' jobs; only eight were still working at the end of the two-month season.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Carlton said Florida growers had flocked to Washington, telling lawmakers they had glimpsed the possible impact of Mr. Smith's proposal after a verification mandate narrowly failed in the Florida Legislature this spring. ''Just the prospect of it, and some of our workers left the state,'' Mr. Carlton said.\par \par \uc2 Labor shortages were also reported by Georgia growers, said Charles Hall, the executive director of the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, after lawmakers there imposed a state mandate to use E-Verify this spring.\par \par \uc2 Some of the most forceful feedback has come from Mr. Smith's home state, where farmers have the backing of the larger Texas Business Association. The group used its clout recently to kill an immigration crackdown law in the State Legislature, even though it was supported by Gov. Rick Perry, a possible Republican presidential contender.\par \par \uc2 ''I think Mr. Smith realizes what his legislation would do to agriculture,'' said Steve Pringle, the legislative director for the Texas Farm Bureau, which claims some 400,000 members. ''I think that's been made very clear to him.''\par \par \uc2 Most growers oppose efforts to expand the H-2A program, which they say is hopelessly bureaucratic and too slow for fast-moving harvests. They favor measures that would grant legal status, at least temporarily, to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  farm workers already in the country. But that idea is anathema to Mr. Smith.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bonacich, the apricot farmer, said that worries about finding legal workers would just add another variable to the delicate equation of a farmer's bottom line.\par \par \uc2 ''Out here, we count the money by the minute,'' Mr. Bonacich said. ''And if we don't have the labor and we don't have people in the fields, a couple of days can make all the difference.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Workers sorting dried apricots at George Bonacich's farm in Patterson, Calif.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Soon after Seemona Sumasar started dating Jerry Ramrattan, she had an inkling that something might be wrong.\par \par \uc2 He said he was a police detective, but never seemed to go to work. He seemed obsessed with ''C.S.I.,'' ''Law & Order'' and other television police dramas.\par \par \uc2 About a year after he moved into her house in Queens, their relationship soured. One day, he cornered her, taped her mouth and raped her, she said. Mr. Ramrattan was arrested.\par \par \uc2 But he soon took his revenge, the authorities said. Drawing on his knowledge of police procedure, gleaned from his time as an informer for law enforcement, he accomplished what prosecutors in New York called one of the most elaborate framing plots that they had ever seen.\par \par \uc2 One night, Ms. Sumasar was pulled over by the police. Before she could speak, detectives slapped handcuffs on her. ''You know you did it,'' she said one later shouted at her. ''Just admit it.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Sumasar, a former \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  analyst who was running a restaurant, said she had no idea what that meant. Yet suddenly, she was being treated like a brazen criminal. She was charged with carrying out a series of armed robberies, based on what the police said was a wealth of evidence, including credible witness statements and proof that her car was the getaway vehicle.\par \par \uc2 In her first extensive interview about her ordeal, she recalled sitting in jail, consumed by one thought: ''Jerry is behind this.''\par \par \uc2 But when she insisted to the authorities that he had set her up, they belittled her claims.\par \par \uc2 Now, though, they concede that Ms. Sumasar was right -- an astonishing turn of events that has transformed her case into one of the most bizarre in the city's recent history.\par \par \uc2 They released her from jail last December after seven months, acknowledging that the entire case against her had been concocted by Mr. Ramrattan, officials said.\par \par \uc2 ''We prosecute tens of thousands of cases each year, but in the collective memory, no one has ever seen anything like this before,'' said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney.\par \par \uc2 ''Few people have the capacity to pull off a master plot of this magnitude to exact revenge,'' Mr. Brown said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ramrattan framed Ms. Sumasar because she would not drop the rape charge, prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 And so even as Mr. Ramrattan remained free on bail in the rape case, Ms. Sumasar, who had no prior criminal record, was facing up to 25 years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Despondent, Ms. Sumasar passed her days behind bars scouring the indictments against her for clues that could help prove her innocence, even as news of lurid crimes that she had not committed were splashed in newspapers.\par \par \uc2 ''From the beginning, I said he made it up,'' Ms. Sumasar said. ''I never thought my life would become a cop film.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Sumasar, 36, is bubbly and petite. She never finished college but used her analytical skills to land six-figure jobs on Wall Street. Yet she acknowledged she can be too trusting.\par \par \uc2 After her arrest, she lost her restaurant franchise and her house in Far Rockaway went into foreclosure. She was separated from her daughter, Chiara, 12.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Sumasar is now planning lawsuits against the Police Departments in New York City and in Nassau County, the location of one of her purported robberies, over her arrest. Neither agency would comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ramrattan never worked as a law enforcement officer, prosecutors say, but he often presented himself as a private investigator.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ramrattan, who is being held at Rikers Island, appeared this month in a Queens court, where a judge refused a request for bail and set his trial date on the rape and conspiracy charges for Oct. 3. He has pleaded not guilty to both. He and his supporters are now voicing their own theory of the case: Ms. Sumasar framed him.\par \par \uc2 ''My son is innocent, he was set up,'' said Shirley Ramrattan, Mr. Ramrattan's mother.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ramrattan's lawyer, Frank Kelly, said, ''Everything about Ms. Sumasar and her associates will come out.''\par \par \uc2 Some legal experts say Ms. Sumasar's story shows how the American justice system can be easily manipulated, with the principle of innocent until proven guilty turned on its head.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors countered that the web of false evidence presented by Mr. Ramrattan was so detailed they had little reason to doubt it.\par \par \uc2 But Anthony Grandinette, Ms. Sumasar's former lawyer, said law enforcement was negligent.\par \par \uc2 ''Why would a tiny woman with no criminal record, who worked 10 years on Wall Street, randomly hold up people at gunpoint at night dressed as a policewoman?'' Mr. Grandinette asked.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Sumasar, the daughter of an Indian taxi company owner from the South American nation of Guyana, was the embodiment of immigrant success.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Ramrattan, dressed in a suit and tie, first entered her restaurant in 2006 and introduced himself as a police detective, Ms. Sumasar, a single mother, recalled being impressed.\par \par \uc2 The two began dating, and Mr. Ramrattan eventually moved into Ms. Sumasar's house. At first, he seemed attentive, but she grew suspicious of him. He lied constantly, she said.\par \par \uc2 ''I said to Jerry, 'You tell so many lies, I think you actually believe what you are saying,' '' Ms. Sumasar said.\par \par \uc2 Throughout 2008, she said she begged him to leave but he refused.\par \par \uc2 After Ms. Sumasar said she was attacked, on March 8, 2009, she pressed rape charges against Mr. Ramrattan, who was arrested and released on bail. Soon after, Mr. Ramrattan sent friends to intimidate her, prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 They said that when she would not back down, he vowed to put her away.\par \par \uc2 The key to his scheme, prosecutors said, was to spread fake clues over time, fooling police into believing that all the evidence pointed to Ms. Sumasar.\par \par \uc2 They said he coached the supposed victims, driving them past Ms. Sumasar's house so that they could describe her Jeep Grand Cherokee and showing them her photo so they could pick her out of a police lineup.\par \par \uc2 The setup began in September 2009, prosecutors said. An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Trinidad told the police that he had been handcuffed and robbed of $700 by an Indian woman who was disguised as a police officer and had a gun, according to court documents.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said Mr. Ramrattan had persuaded the immigrant to lie, telling him that he could receive a special visa for victims of violent crimes.\par \par \uc2 Six months later, another man said he had been robbed in Nassau County by two police impersonators and described the main aggressor as an Indian woman about Ms. Sumasar's height. The man said he had managed to take down the first three letters of the Jeep Grand Cherokee's New York license plate -- AJD.\par \par \uc2 All the while, Ms. Sumasar had a strong alibi, including cell phone records showing that calls were made from her phone at a casino in Connecticut on the day of the robbery.\par \par \uc2 But Sheryl Anania, executive assistant district attorney in Nassau County, said Ms. Sumasar's business was foundering, so she appeared to have a motive.\par \par \uc2 The final fake crime was conjured in May 2010, officials said, when an acquaintance of Mr. Ramrattan said she had been held up by a couple posing as police officers. She said they were driving a Grand Cherokee, but she gave a full Florida license plate number.\par \par \uc2 She said she heard the pair call each other by name -- ''Seem'' and ''Elvis.'' Elvis was the nickname of another former boyfriend of Ms. Sumasar, who owned the Jeep.\par \par \uc2 When the police looked into the Florida plate number, they found that the day after the purported March robbery, the title and the plate for the Cherokee had been transferred from Elvis to Ms. Sumasar's sister in Florida.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Sumasar, who holds a Florida driver's license, had driven the car to Florida to register it. To the police, she seemed to be covering her tracks.\par \par \uc2 With all the evidence pointing to Ms. Sumasar, the police arrested her. Bail was set at $1 million.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said the scheme unraveled in December 2010 -- just weeks before Ms. Sumasar was to go on trial -- when an informer told the police that Mr. Ramrattan had staged the plot. The informer gave detectives a number for a cellphone owned by Mr. Ramrattan.\par \par \uc2 When they checked phone records, they discovered multiple calls to the false witnesses, who confessed to the police. They were charged with perjury.\par \par \uc2 Today, Ms. Sumasar is trying to rebuild her life.\par \par \uc2 She checks the Rikers Web site frequently to make sure Mr. Ramrattan has not been released or escaped. She once paid for purchases with cash but now uses only credit cards, so there is a paper trail attesting to her whereabouts.\par \par \uc2 ''From the beginning I was presumed guilty -- not innocent,'' she said. ''I felt like I never had a chance.''\par \par \uc2 ''I can never have faith in justice in this country again.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Seemona Sumasar spent seven months in jail, accused of robberies that the authorities later said were invented by an ex-boyfriend, Jerry Ramrattan, center right.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In his article about his life in America as an undocumented immigrant, Jose Antonio Vargas addressed an issue that should upset us all. I knew Jose when I was his speech coach at Mountain View High School. I didn't know he was illegal but rather knew him as one of the hardest-working members of the team. I remember working with him to more clearly enunciate in a highly competitive endeavor. He was driven, and he was successful. Yes, he has broken our laws. So have many on Wall Street, who simply paid money, got a slap on the hand and went on to make a lot more money. Jose is a hero /-- my hero. He worked to be the best he could be, asking nothing of our country beyond the right to stay where his mother sent him as a young boy. He is another example of why we need to pass the Dream Act.\par \par \uc2 RICHARD HAAS,\par \par \uc2 Sunnyvale, Calif.\par \par \uc2 I was duped. I once hired an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to be a reporter for The Chronicle. . . . Jose lied to me and everyone else he worked for. . . . The force of his story /-- good reaction and bad /-- and his project just might lubricate the politically tarred-up wheels of government and help create sane immigration policy. If it has that effect, we should forgive him his lies.\par \par \uc2 PHIL BRONSTEIN,\par \par \uc2 Editor at Large, The San Francisco Chronicle, 10:43 p.m., June 22, sfgate.com\par \par \uc2 The first part of Vargas's story -- a kid living in and loving America for years before his shocking discovery that he has been made complicit in a crime -- does indeed elicit sympathy. It's stories like these that make me open, at least in principle, to something like a narrowly tailored version of the Dream Act. But the second part of his story, in which a fear- and shame-driven Vargas, with the aid of his family, perpetuated and compounded those crimes (Vargas eventually got around to what you might redundantly call fraudulent tax fraud, repeatedly reporting himself as a citizen rather than a ''permanent resident,'' when in fact he was neither), elicits from me nothing like the outpouring of support Vargas is already enjoying on the left.\par \par \uc2 DANIEL FOSTER,\par \par \uc2 1:26 p.m., June 22, nationalreview.com\par \par \uc2 As in the Arab-Israeli dispute, there is a broad consensus among policy makers on the outlines of what should be done: we should provide some path to legitimate citizenship for the millions of people like Vargas who are here illegally but who contribute every day to our communities. We should tighten employer sanctions and law enforcement. Unfortunately, as in the Arab-Israeli dispute, knowledge of the general destination is not always sufficient to navigate large obstacles along the way.\par \par \uc2 HAROLD POLLACK,\par \par \uc2 4:52 p.m., June 23, TNR.com\par \par \uc2 You have to have rules. Rules are good. But all rules have exceptions. Vargas's story is the tip of an iceberg of unrecognized talent among children of illegal immigrants who are educated, bright, useful members of American society and should be accepted as American citizens.\par \par \uc2 CAROLYN WELCH,\par \par \uc2 Indianapolis\par \par \uc2 This is a compelling article. Unfortunately, 16 million unemployed Americans have compelling stories. Illegal immigrants do not by dint of rule of law have the right to stay in the country, work, vote or serve as an endless bridge for more illegals. Human interest makes for compassion and not policy. It's time to look at this issue through the prism of the poorest of Americans, whose stories of competition with illegals is the saddest and most underreported story in journalism.\par \par \uc2 NEIL ROBERT,\par \par \uc2 New Haven, Conn., 11:57 a.m., June 22, nytimes.com\par \par \uc2 GRAPHICS: ''Telling that some have expressed a desire to throw Jose Antonio Vargas 'back over the border.'

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Civil rights groups filed a class-action lawsuit on Friday against a new state law that cracks down on illegal immigration, saying it would violate the constitutional rights of United States citizens. The law, which supporters described as the toughest of its kind in the nation, requires public schools to report students' immigration status, makes it a crime to give a ride to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and bars all contracts with those immigrants. ''This law revisits the state's painful racial past,'' said Mary Bauer, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the groups bringing the suit.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110709e7790008f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The following is a transcript of President Obama's news conference in the East Wing, as provided by the White House.\par \par \uc2 PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good morning, everybody. Have a seat, please. I just want to say a few words about the economy before I take your questions.\par \par \uc2 There are a lot of folks out there who are still struggling with the effects of the recession. Many people are still looking for work or looking for a job that pays more. Families are wondering how they'd deal with a broken refrigerator or a busted transmission, or how they're going to finance their kids' college education, and they're also worrying about the possibility of layoffs.\par \par \uc2 The struggles of middle-class families were a big problem long before the recession hit in 2007. They weren't created overnight, and the truth is our economic challenges are not going to be solved overnight. But there are more steps that we can take right now that would help businesses create jobs here in America.\par \par \uc2 Today, our administration is trying to take those steps, so we're reviewing government regulations so that we can fix any rules in place that are an unnecessary burden on businesses. We're working with the private sector to get small businesses and start-ups the financing they need to grow and expand. And because of the partnership that we've launched with businesses and community colleges, 500,000 workers will be able to receive the right skills and training for manufacturing jobs in companies all across America -- jobs that companies are looking to fill.\par \par \uc2 In addition to the steps that my administration can take on our own, there are also things that Congress could do right now that will help create good jobs. Right now, Congress can send me a bill that would make it easier for entrepreneurs to patent a new product or idea - because we can't give innovators in other countries a big leg up when it comes to opening new businesses and creating new jobs. That's something Congress could do right now.\par \par \uc2 Right now, Congress could send me a bill that puts construction workers back on the job rebuilding roads and bridges - not by having government fund and pick every project, but by providing loans to private companies and states and local governments on the basis of merit and not politics. That's pending in Congress right now.\par \par \uc2 Right now, Congress can advance a set of trade agreements that would allow American businesses to sell more of their goods and services to countries in Asia and South America - agreements that would support tens of thousands of American jobs while helping those adversely affected by trade. That's pending before Congress right now.\par \par \uc2 And right now, we could give middle-class families the security of knowing that the tax cut I signed in December will be there for one more year.\par \par \uc2 So there are a number of steps that my administration is taking, but there are also a number of steps that Congress could be taking right now on items that historically have had bipartisan support and that would help put more Americans back to work.\par \par \uc2 Many of these ideas have been tied up in Congress for some time. But, as I said, all of them enjoy bipartisan support, and all of them would help grow the economy. So I urge Congress to act on these ideas now.\par \par \uc2 Of course, one of the most important and urgent things we can do for the economy is something that both parties are working on right now - and that's reducing our nation's deficit. Over the last few weeks, the Vice President has been leading negotiations with Democrats and Republicans on this issue, and they've made some real progress in narrowing down the differences. As of last week, both parties had identified more than $1 trillion worth of spending cuts already.\par \par \uc2 But everyone also knows that we'll need to do more to close the deficit. We can't get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can't just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare. So we're going to need to look at the whole budget, as I said several months ago. And we've got to eliminate waste wherever we find it and make some tough decisions about worthy priorities.\par \par \uc2 And that means trimming the defense budget, while still meeting our security needs. It means we'll have to tackle entitlements, as long as we keep faith with seniors and children with disabilities by maintaining the fundamental security that Medicare and Medicaid provide. And, yes, we're going to have to tackle spending in the tax code.\par \par \uc2 There's been a lot of discussion about revenues and raising taxes in recent weeks, so I want to be clear about what we're proposing here. I spent the last two years cutting taxes for ordinary Americans, and I want to extend those middle-class tax cuts. The tax cuts I'm proposing we get rid of are tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires; tax breaks for oil companies and hedge fund managers and corporate jet owners.\par \par \uc2 It would be nice if we could keep every tax break there is, but we've got to make some tough choices here if we want to reduce our deficit. And if we choose to keep those tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, if we choose to keep a tax break for corporate jet owners, if we choose to keep tax breaks for oil and gas companies that are making hundreds of billions of dollars, then that means we've got to cut some kids off from getting a college scholarship. That means we've got to stop funding certain grants for medical research. That means that food safety may be compromised. That means that Medicare has to bear a greater part of the burden. Those are the choices we have to make.\par \par \uc2 So the bottom line is this: Any agreement to reduce our deficit is going to require tough decisions and balanced solutions. And before we ask our seniors to pay more for health care, before we cut our children's education, before we sacrifice our commitment to the research and innovation that will help create more jobs in the economy, I think it's only fair to ask an oil company or a corporate jet owner that has done so well to give up a tax break that no other business enjoys. I don't think that's real radical. I think the majority of Americans agree with that.\par \par \uc2 So the good news is, because of the work that's been done, I this we can actually bridge our differences. I think there is a conceptual framework that would allow us to make huge progress on our debt and deficit, and do so in a way that does not hurt our economy right here and right now.\par \par \uc2 And it's not often that Washington sees both parties agree on the scale and the urgency of the challenge at hand. Nobody wants to put the creditworthiness of the United States in jeopardy. Nobody wants to see the United States default. So we've got to seize this moment, and we have to seize it soon. The Vice President and I will continue these negotiations with both leaders of both parties in Congress for as long as it takes, and we will reach a deal that will require our government to live within its means and give our businesses confidence and get this economy moving.\par \par \uc2 So, with that, I will take your questions. I've got my list here. Starting off with Ben Feller, Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you very much, Mr. President. I'd like to follow up on the comments you just made as you try to reach a deal to raise the debt limit and cut the deficit. You keep saying that there needs to be this balanced approach of spending cuts and taxes. But Republicans say flatly, they won't --\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: That they don't want a balanced approach.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: They don't want any tax increases, as they put it. And the House Speaker says not only that he doesn't support that, but that plan won't -- will not pass the House. So my question is will you insist, ultimately, that a deal has to include those tax increases that you just laid out? Is that an absolute red line for you? And if it is, can you explain to us how that can possibly get through the Congress?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Look, I think that what we've seen in negotiations here in Washington is a lot of people say a lot of things to satisfy their base or to get on cable news, but that hopefully, leaders at a certain point rise to the occasion and they do the right thing for the American people. And that's what I expect to happen this time. Call me naive, but my expectation is that leaders are going to lead.\par \par \uc2 Now, I just want to be clear about what's at stake here. The Republicans say they want to reduce the deficit. Every single observer who's not an elected official, who's not a politician, says we can't reduce our deficit in the scale and scope that we need to without having a balanced approach that looks at everything.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have to accept some painful spending cuts that hurt some of our constituencies and we may not like. And we've shown a willingness to do that for the greater good. To say, look, there are some things that are good programs that are nice to have; we can't afford them right now.\par \par \uc2 I, as Commander-in-Chief, have to have difficult conversations with the Pentagon saying, you know what, there's fat here; we're going to have to trim it out. And Bob Gates has already done a good job identifying $400 billion in cuts, but we're going to do more. And I promise you the preference of the Pentagon would not to cut any more, because they feel like they've already given.\par \par \uc2 So we're going to have to look at entitlements -- and that's always difficult politically. But I've been willing to say we need to see where we can reduce the cost of health care spending and Medicare and Medicaid in the out-years, not by shifting costs on to seniors, as some have proposed, but rather by actually reducing those costs. But even if we're doing it in a smart way, that's still tough politics. But it's the right thing to do.\par \par \uc2 So the question is, if everybody else is willing to take on their sacred cows and do tough things in order to achieve the goal of real deficit reduction, then I think it would be hard for the Republicans to stand there and say that the tax break for corporate jets is sufficiently important that we're not willing to come to the table and get a deal done. Or, we're so concerned about protecting oil and gas subsidies for oil companies that are making money hand over fist -- that's the reason we're not going to come to a deal.\par \par \uc2 I don't think that's a sustainable position. And the truth of the matter is, if you talk to Republicans who are not currently in office, like Alan Simpson who co-chaired my bipartisan commission, he doesn't think that's a sustainable position. Pete Domenici, Republican, co-chaired something with Alice Rivlin, the Democrat, says that's -- he doesn't think that's a sustainable position. You can't reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix.\par \par \uc2 And the revenue we're talking about isn't coming out of the pockets of middle-class families that are struggling. It's coming out of folks who are doing extraordinarily well and are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born.\par \par \uc2 If you are a wealthy CEO or a health -- hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They're lower than they've been since the 1950s. And you can afford it. You'll still be able to ride on your corporate jet; you're just going to have to pay a little more.\par \par \uc2 And if we -- I just want to emphasize what I said earlier. If we do not have revenues, that means there are a bunch of kids out there who are not getting college scholarships. If we do not have those revenues, then the kinds of cuts that would be required might compromise the National Weather Service. It means that we would not be funding critical medical research. It means that food inspection might be compromised. And I've said to some of the Republican leaders, you go talk to your constituents, the Republican constituents, and ask them are they willing to compromise their kids' safety so that some corporate jet owner continues to get a tax break. And I'm pretty sure what the answer would be.\par \par \uc2 So we're going to keep on having these conversations. And my belief is, is that the Republican leadership in Congress will, hopefully sooner rather than later, come to the conclusion that they need to make the right decisions for the country; that everybody else has been willing to move off their maximalist position -- they need to do the same.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: You think they'll ultimately give in?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: My expectation is that they'll do the responsible thing.\par \par \uc2 Chuck Todd.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. There have been a lot of questions about the constitutionality -- constitutional interpretations of a few decisions you've made, so I'll just simply ask: Do you believe the War Powers Act is constitutional? Do you believe that the debt limit is constitutional, the idea that Congress can do this? And do you believe that marriage is a civil right?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Well, that was a hodgepodge. (Laughter.) Chuck, we're going to assign you to the Supreme Court, man. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 I'm not a Supreme Court justice so I'm not going to -- putting my constitutional law professor hat on here. Let me focus on, initially, the issue of Libya. I want to talk about the substance of Libya because there's been all kinds of noise about process and congressional consultation and so forth. Let's talk about concretely what's happened.\par \par \uc2 Muammar Qaddafi, who, prior to Osama bin Laden, was responsible for more American deaths than just about anybody on the planet, was threatening to massacre his people. And as part of an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate that is almost unprecedented, we went in and took out air defense systems so that an international coalition could provide a no-fly zone, could protect -- provide humanitarian protection to the people on the ground.\par \par \uc2 I spoke to the American people about what we would do. I said there would be no troops on the ground. I said that we would not be carrying the lion's share of this operation, but as members of NATO, we would be supportive of it because it's in our national security interest and also because it's the right thing to do.\par \par \uc2 We have done exactly what I said we would do. We have not put any boots on the ground. And our allies -- who, historically, we've complained aren't willing to carry enough of the load when it comes to NATO operations -- have carried a big load when it comes to these NATO operations. And as a consequence, we've protected thousands of people in Libya; we have not seen a single U.S. casualty; there's no risks of additional escalation. This operation is limited in time and in scope.\par \par \uc2 So I said to the American people, here's our narrow mission. We have carried out that narrow mission in exemplary fashion. And throughout this process we consulted with Congress. We've had 10 hearings on it. We've sent reams of information about what the operations are. I've had all the members of Congress over to talk about it. So a lot of this fuss is politics.\par \par \uc2 And if you look substantively at what we've done, we have done exactly what we said to do, under a U.N. mandate, and we have protected thousands of lives in the process. And as a consequence, a guy who was a state sponsor of terrorist operations against the United States of America is pinned down and the noose is tightening around him.\par \par \uc2 Now, when you look at the history of the War Powers resolution, it came up after the Vietnam War in which we had half-a-million soldiers there, tens of thousands of lives lost, hundreds of billions of dollars spent -- and Congress said, you know what, we don't want something like that happening again. So if you're going to start getting us into those kinds of commitments you've got to consult with Congress beforehand.\par \par \uc2 And I think that such consultation is entirely appropriate. But do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers resolution? The answer is no. So I don't even have to get to the constitutional question. There may be a time in which there was a serious question as to whether or not the War Powers resolution -- act was constitutional. I don't have to get to the question.\par \par \uc2 We have engaged in a limited operation to help a lot of people against one of the worst tyrants in the world -- somebody who nobody should want to defend -- and we should be sending a unified message to this guy that he should step down and give his people a fair chance to live their lives without fear. And this suddenly becomes the cause celebre for some folks in Congress? Come on.\par \par \uc2 So you had, what, a three-parter? (Laughter.) What are the other two?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: There is some question about the constitutionality of the War Powers Act.\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: I'm just saying I don't have to reach it. That's a good legal answer.\par \par \uc2 (Inaudible.)\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Let me start by saying that this administration, under my direction, has consistently said we cannot discriminate as a country against people on the basis of sexual orientation. And we have done more in the two and a half years that I've been in here than the previous 43 Presidents to uphold that principle, whether it's ending ''don't ask, don't tell,'' making sure that gay and lesbian partners can visit each other in hospitals, making sure that federal benefits can be provided to same-sex couples. Across the board -- hate crimes -- we have made sure that that is a central principle of this administration, because I think it's a central principle of America.\par \par \uc2 Now, what we've also done is we've said that DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, is unconstitutional. And so we've said we cannot defend the federal government poking its nose into what states are doing and putting the thumb on the scale against same-sex couples.\par \par \uc2 What I've seen happen over the last several years, and what happened in New York last week I think was a good thing, because what you saw was the people of New York having a debate, talking through these issues. It was contentious; it was emotional; but, ultimately, they made a decision to recognize civil marriage. And I think that's exactly how things should work.\par \par \uc2 And so I think it is -- I think it is important for us to work through these issues -- because each community is going to be different and each state is going to be different -- to work through them. In the meantime, we filed a -- we filed briefs before the Supreme Court that say we think that any discrimination against gays, lesbians, transgenders is subject to heightened scrutiny, and we don't think that DOMA is unconstitutional [sic]. And so I think the combination of what states are doing, what the courts are doing, the actions that we're taking administratively, all are how the process should work.\par \par \uc2 Are you at all uncomfortable that there could be different rules in different states, you know, and for somebody to make the argument that's what we saw during segregation --\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Chuck, I think what you're seeing is a profound recognition on the part of the American people that gays and lesbians and transgender persons are our brothers, our sisters, our children, our cousins, our friends, our co-workers, and that they've got to be treated like every other American. And I think that principle will win out. It's not going to be perfectly smooth, and it turns out that the President -- I've discovered since I've been in this office -- can't dictate precisely how this process moves. But I think we're moving in a direction of greater equality and I think that's a good thing.\par \par \uc2 Julianna.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. I only have a two-parter. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Thanks.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Are you concerned that the current debate over debt and deficits is preventing you from taking the kind of decisive and more balanced action needed to create jobs in this country, which is the number one concern for Americans?\par \par \uc2 And also, one of the impediments to job growth that the business community repeatedly cites is the regulatory environment. So do you think that the NLRB complaint against \uc2 Boeing\uc2 , that this has created some of the -- is an example of the kinds of regulations that chill job growth, and also that you yourself have called ''just plain dumb''?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: I think it's important to understand that deficit reduction, debt reduction, should be part of an overall package for job growth over the long term. It's not the only part of it, but it's an important part of it.\par \par \uc2 So as I mentioned at the top, I think it's important for us to look at rebuilding our transportation infrastructure in this country. That could put people back to work right now -- construction workers back to work right now. And it would get done work that America needs to get done. We used to have the best roads, the best bridges, the best airports. We don't anymore. And that's not good for our long-term competitiveness.\par \par \uc2 So we could put people to work right now and make sure that we're in a good position to win the future, as well. I think --\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- spending and (inaudible.)\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: I'm going to get to it. I think that it's important for us to look at the tax code and figure out, are there ways that we can simplify it and also build on the work that we've already done, for example, saying to small businesses or start-up businesses, you don't have to pay capital gains when you're in start-up mode, because we want you to get out there and start a business. That's important. Making sure that SBA is helping to get financing to small businesses, that's important.\par \par \uc2 So there are a whole range of things that we can be doing. I think these trade deals will be important -- because right now South Korea, frankly, has a better deal when it comes to our trading relationship than we do. Part of the reason I want to pass this trade deal is you see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States and you don't see any American cars in Korea. So let's rebalance that trading relationship. That's why we should get this passed.\par \par \uc2 So there are a range of things that we could be doing right now. Deficit and debt reduction should be seen as part of that overall process, because I think if businesses feel confident that we've got our act together here in Washington, that not only is the government not going to default but we're also preparing for a future in which the population is getting older and we're going to have more expenses on the Medicare side and Social Security, that businesses will feel more confident about investing here in the United States of America.\par \par \uc2 So I don't think they're contradictory. And as I've said before, certainly in my job, but I think Congress, as well, they've got to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. So we can focus on jobs at the same time as we're focusing on debt and deficit reduction.\par \par \uc2 Now, one of the things that my administration has talked about is, is there, in fact, a bunch of -- a tangle of regulations out there that are preventing businesses from growing and expanding as quickly as they should. Keep in mind that the business community is always complaining about regulations. When unemployment is at 3 percent and they're making record profits, they're going to still complain about regulations because, frankly, they want to be able to do whatever they think is going to maximize their profits.\par \par \uc2 I've got an obligation to make sure that we're upholding smart regulations that protect our air and protect our water and protect our food. If you're flying on a plane, you want to make sure that there are some regulations in place to assure safety in air travel, right? So there are some core regulations that we've got to maintain.\par \par \uc2 But what I have done -- and this is unprecedented, by the way, no administration has done this before -- is I've said to each agency, don't just look at current regulations -- or don't just look at future regulations, regulations that we're proposing, let's go backwards and look at regulations that are already on the books, and if they don't make sense, let's get rid of them. And we are in the process of doing that, and we've already identified changes that could potentially save billions of dollars for companies over the next several years.\par \par \uc2 Now, you asked specifically about one decision that was made by the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB, and this relates to \uc2 Boeing\uc2 . Essentially, the NLRB made a finding that \uc2 Boeing\uc2  had not followed the law in making a decision to move a plant. And it's an independent agency. It's going before a judge. So I don't want to get into the details of the case. I don't know all the facts. That's going to be up to a judge to decide.\par \par \uc2 What I do know is this -- that as a general proposition, companies need to have the freedom to relocate. They have to follow the law, but that's part of our system. And if they're choosing to relocate here in the United States, that's a good thing. And what it doesn't make -- what I think defies common sense would be a notion that we would be shutting down a plant or laying off workers because labor and management can't come to a sensible agreement.\par \par \uc2 So my hope is, is that even as this thing is working its way through, everybody steps back for a second and says, look, if jobs are being created here in the United States, let's make sure that we're encouraging that. And we can't afford to have labor and management fighting all the time, at a time when we're competing against Germany and China and other countries that want to sell goods all around the world. And obviously, the airplane industry is an area where we still have a huge advantage, and I want to make sure that we keep it.\par \par \uc2 Mark Lander.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you very much, Mr. President. Yesterday, Admiral McRaven testified before Congress that he was concerned that there wasn't a clear procedure to be followed if a terrorist were captured alive abroad. The administration has also been clear that it doesn't want to continue to send suspected terrorists to Guantanamo.\par \par \uc2 What message do you have for American men and women in uniform who are undertaking missions, like the very risky one to capture and kill bin Laden, about what they should do in the event that they capture someone alive? And does the lack of these clear procedures raise the risk that forces might be more inclined to kill suspected terrorists in the field, rather than capture them alive, thus depriving the U.S. of the intelligence that they could provide?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Well, first of all, my top priority in each and every one of these situations is to make sure that we're apprehending those who would attack the United States; that we are getting all the intelligence that we can out of these individuals, in a way that's consistent with due process of law; and that we try them, we prosecute them, in a way that's consistent with rule of law.\par \par \uc2 And, frankly, there are going to be different dispositions of the case depending on the situation. And there are going to be sometimes where a military commission may be appropriate. There are going to be some times where Article III courts are appropriate in terms of prosecution. And we do have a process to work through all the agencies -- Department of Defense, Department of Justice, FBI, anybody else who might be involved in these kinds of operations -- to think through on a case-by-case basis how a particular individual should be dealt with.\par \par \uc2 And I think that when it comes to our men and women in uniform who might be carrying out these missions, the instructions are not going to be based on whether or not the lawyers can sort out how we detain them or how we prosecute them. Their mission is to make sure that they apprehend the individual; they do so safely with minimum risk to American lives. And that's always going to be the priority, is just carrying out the mission. And that message is sent consistently to our men and women in uniform anytime they start carrying out one of these missions.\par \par \uc2 But I think it's important to understand, and the American people need to be assured that anytime we initiate a mission like this, our top priorities are making sure this person is not able to carry out attacks against the United States and that we're able to obtain actionable intelligence from those individuals. And so that mitigates against this danger that you're suggesting that our main goal is going to be to kill these individuals as opposed to potentially capturing them. Okay?\par \par \uc2 Mike Emanuel, FOX.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Last week when you gave your Afghanistan drawdown speech, the word ''victory,'' in terms of the overall war in Afghanistan, was not in your speech. So I'm wondering, sir, if you can define for the 100,000 troops you have in harm's way in Afghanistan ''victory'' in the war, and for their families, as well, sir.\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Well, I didn't use ''victory'' in my West Point speech, either. What I said was we can be successful in our mission, which is narrowly drawn, and that is to make sure that al Qaeda cannot attack the United States of America or our allies or our interests overseas, and to make sure that we have an Afghan government that -- and an Afghan people that can provide for their own security.\par \par \uc2 We are being successful in those missions. And the reason that we're in a position to draw down 10,000 troops this year and a total of 33,000 troops by the end of next summer is precisely because of the extraordinary work of our men and women in uniform. What they've been able to do is to severely cripple al Qaeda's capacities.\par \par \uc2 Obviously bin Laden got the most attention, but even before the bin Laden operation we had decimated the middle ranks and some of the upper ranks of al Qaeda. They're having a great deal of difficulty operating, a great deal of difficulty communicating and financing themselves, and we are going to keep the pressure on. And in part that's because of the extraordinary sacrifices that have been made by our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 What we've also been able to do is to ramp up the training of Afghan forces. So we've got an additional 100,000 Afghan troops, both Army and police, that have been trained as a consequence of this surge. And that is going to give the Afghans more capacity to defend themselves because it is in our national interest to make sure that you did not have a collapse of Afghanistan in which extremist elements could flood the zone once again, and over time al Qaeda might be in a position to rebuild itself.\par \par \uc2 So what I laid out was a plan in which we are going to be drawing down our troops from Afghanistan after 10 very long years and an enormous sacrifice by our troops. But we will draw them in a -- draw them down in a responsible way that will allow Afghanistan to defend itself and will give us the operational capacity to continue to put pressure on al Qaeda until that network is entirely defeated.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION -- the attack on the Intercontinental Hotel yesterday, sir? And does that concern you that Afghan forces may not be able to step up if these guys are able to attack a high-profile target in the nation's capital?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Well, keep in mind the drawdown hasn't begun. So we understood that Afghanistan is a dangerous place, that the Taliban is still active, and that there are still going to be events like this on occasion. The question is, in terms of overall trend, is Afghanistan capacity increasing.\par \par \uc2 Kabul, for example, which contains a huge proportion of the Afghan population as a whole, has been largely policed by Afghan forces for quite some time. And they've done a reasonably good job. Kabul is much safer than it was, and Afghan forces in Kabul are much more capable than they were.\par \par \uc2 That doesn't mean that there are not going to be events like this potentially taking place, and that will probably go on for some time. Our work is not done. But as I said in my speech, the tide of war is receding. We have shifted to a transition phase. And much like we've seen in Iraq, where we've drawn down our troops, the remainder of our troops will be coming out by the end of this year, but Iraq has been able to maintain a democratic government and to tamp down violence there -- we think a similar approach makes sense in Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 But even in Iraq, you still see the occasional attack. These are still countries that are digging themselves out of a lot of war, a lot of conflict. They're dangerous places. And so they're not going to be perfectly safe, even if we were there. But we can improve the chances for the Afghan people to defend themselves.\par \par \uc2 Jim Sciutto.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. You're aware that Senators Kerry and McCain have a proposal on the Senate floor to give you the leeway to continue operations in Libya for a further year. You've just said that this, from the beginning, has been an operation limited in time and scope. Initially you said days, not weeks. Are you prepared, are the American people prepared for this operation, with American support, to continue for a further year? And is there any other definition of success than Qaddafi being removed from power?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Well, first of all, Jim, just a slight correction. What I told the American people was that the initial phase where Americans were in the lead would take days, perhaps weeks. And that's exactly what happened, right? I mean, after -- around two weeks, a little less than two weeks, we had transitioned where NATO had taken full control of the operation. So promise made, promise kept.\par \par \uc2 Second, I think when you have the former Republican nominee for President, John McCain, and the former nominee for President on the Democratic side, John Kerry, coming together to support what we're doing in Libya, that should tell the American people that this is important. And I very much appreciate their efforts in that regard.\par \par \uc2 Third, when it comes to our definitions of success, the U.N. mandate has said that we are there to make sure that you do not see a massacre directed against Libyan civilians by the Libyan regime. The Libyan regime's capacity has been greatly reduced as a consequence of our operation. That's already been successful. What we've seen both in the East and in the West is that opposition forces have been able to mobilize themselves and start getting organized, and people are starting to see the possibility of a more peaceful future on the horizon.\par \par \uc2 What is also true is, as long as Qaddafi is still presenting himself as the head of the Libyan government, and as long as he still controls large numbers of troops, the Libyan people are going to be in danger of counter-offensives and of retribution. So there is no doubt that Qaddafi stepping down from power is -- from the international community's perspective -- going to be the primary way that we can assure that the overall mission of Libya's people being protected is accomplished.\par \par \uc2 And I just want to point out -- I know it's something you know -- the International Criminal Court identified Qaddafi as having violated international law, having committed war crimes. What we've seen is reports of troops engaging in horrible acts, including potentially using rape as a weapon of war. And so when you have somebody like that in charge of large numbers of troops, I think it would be hard for us to feel confident that the Libyan people are going to be protected unless he steps down.\par \par \uc2 Now, what that means, whether there's the possibility of Libyans arriving at some sort of political settlement, that I think is something that ultimately the Libyan people are going to have to make a decision about -- because the international community is there in service of that broader goal, of a peaceful Libya.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Would you accept a political settlement with him involved as success from the American perspective?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: I would accept him stepping down so that he is not directing armed forces against the Libyan people. He needs to step down. He needs to go.\par \par \uc2 Laura Meckler.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. In these debt talks, would you accept -- would you like to see some sort of tax breaks aimed at stimulating the economy, even though that would of course add to the deficit itself?\par \par \uc2 And I'd also like to follow up on one of your earlier answers about same-sex marriage. You said that it's a positive step that so many states, including New York, are moving towards that. Does that mean that you personally now do support same-sex marriage, putting aside what individual states decide? Is that your personal view?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: I'm not going to make news on that today. (Laughter.) Good try, though.\par \par \uc2 And with respect to the deficit and debt talks and where we need to go, I do think it's important, since we're looking at how do we reduce the debt and deficit both in a 10-year window as well as beyond a 10-year window, to understand that one of the most important things we can do for debt and deficit reduction is to grow the economy.\par \par \uc2 And so if there are steps that in the short term may reduce the amount of cash in the treasury but in the long term mean that we're growing at 3.5 percent instead of 2.5 percent, then those ideas are worth exploring.\par \par \uc2 Obviously that was what we did in December during the lame duck session, when Democrats and Republicans came together and we said, you know what, a payroll tax cut makes sense in order to boost the economy; unemployment insurance makes sense in order to boost the economy. All that stuff puts money in people's pockets at a time when they're still struggling to dig themselves out of this recession. And so the American people have an extra thousand dollars, on average, in their pockets because of the tax cuts that we initiated. And that has helped cushion some of the tough stuff that happened in the first six months of this year, including the effects on oil prices as a consequence of what happened in the Middle East as well as what happened in Japan.\par \par \uc2 I think that it makes perfect sense for us to take a look at can we extend the payroll tax, for example, an additional year, and other tax breaks for business investment that could make a big difference in terms of creating more jobs right now.\par \par \uc2 What we need to do is to restore business confidence and the confidence of the American people that we're on track -- that we're not going to get there right away, that this is a tough slog, but that we still are moving forward. And I think that it makes sense, as we're looking at an overall package, to see, are there some things that we can do to sustain the recovery, so long as the overall package achieves our goals -- the goals that I set out, which is $4 trillion within a 10-to 12-year window, and making sure that we're bending the costs of things like health care over the long term.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm sorry, I know you don't want to say anything further on the same-sex marriage issue, but what you said before really led me to believe that that's what is in your personal mind. And I'm wondering what's the distinction you're drawing.\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Laura, I think this has been asked and answered. I'll keep on giving you the same answer until I give you a different one, all right? And that won't be today. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: That's going to be -- (inaudible.)\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Yes, exactly. I thought you'd like that one. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 Antonieta Cadiz? There you are.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you very much, Mr. President. First, if you receive a mandatory E-verify bill only without legalization, are you planning to veto that deal?\par \par \uc2 And second, on Fast and Furious, members of Congress and the government of Mexico are still waiting for answers. Are you planning to replace ATF leadership? And when can we expect the results of the current investigation?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: On the second question, as you know, my attorney general has made clear that he certainly would not have ordered gun running to be able to pass through into Mexico. The investigation is still pending. I'm not going to comment on a current investigation. I've made very clear my views that that would not be an appropriate step by the ATF, and we got to find out how that happened. As soon as the investigation is completed, I think appropriate actions will be taken.\par \par \uc2 With respect to E-verify, we need comprehensive immigration reform. I've said it before. I will say it again. I will say it next week. And I'll say it six months from now. We've got to have a system that makes sure that we uphold our tradition as a nation of laws and that we also uphold our tradition as a nation of immigrants. And that means tough border security, going after employers that are illegally hiring and exploiting workers, making sure that we also have a pathway for legal status for those who are living in the shadows right now.\par \par \uc2 We may not be able to get everything that I would like to see in a package, but we have to have a balanced package. E-verify can be an important enforcement tool if it's not riddled with errors, if U.S. citizens are protected -- because what I don't want is a situation in which employers are forced to set up a system that they can't be certain works. And we don't want to expose employers to the risk where they end up rejecting a qualified candidate for a job because the list says that that person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and it turns out that the person isn't an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . That wouldn't be fair for the employee and would probably get the employer in trouble as well.\par \par \uc2 So I think the goal right now is to let's continue to see if we can perfect the E-verify system. Let's make sure that we have safeguards in place to prevent the kind of scenarios that I talked about. But let's also not lose sight of some of the other components to immigration reform. For example, making sure that DREAM Act kids -- kids who have grown up here in the United States, think of themselves as Americans, who are not legal through no fault of their own, and who are ready to invest and give back to our country and go to school and fight in our military and start businesses here -- let's make sure that those kids can stay.\par \par \uc2 We need to have a more balanced approach than just a verification system.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (Inaudible.)\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: I don't have an answer as to whether the investigation is completed yet, and it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on the investigation if I don't -- if it's not yet completed.\par \par \uc2 Jessica Yellin. Congratulations, your first question here.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President.\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: No pressure. You're going to do great. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you. Your administration has laid out four different dates by which you've said that the debt ceiling must be raised or the U.S. would face potential dire consequences. Three of those dates have come and gone and we haven't faced financial calamity. Some of your critics have argued that these are then scare tactics to force a deal. So why should the American people believe that the August 2nd deadline is the final deadline by which a deal must be raised? And would you also spell out for us what you believe will happen if the debt ceiling is not raised by that date?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: Jessica, let's be clear. We haven't given out four different dates. We have given out dates that are markers for us getting into trouble. It's the equivalent of you're driving down the street and the yellow light starts flashing. The yellow light is flashing. Now, it hasn't been a red light yet. So what Tim Geithner has said is, technically speaking, we're in a position now where we're having to do a whole bunch of things to make sure that our bills are paid.\par \par \uc2 By August 2nd, we run out of tools to make sure that all our bills are paid. So that is a hard deadline. And I want everybody to understand that this is a jobs issue. This is not an abstraction. If the United States government, for the first time, cannot pay its bills, if it defaults, then the consequences for the U.S. economy will be significant and unpredictable. And that is not a good thing.\par \par \uc2 We don't know how capital markets will react. But if capital markets suddenly decide, you know what, the U.S. government doesn't pay its bills, so we're going to start pulling our money out, and the U.S. Treasury has to start to raise interest rates in order to attract more money to pay off our bills, that means higher interest rates for businesses; that means higher interest rates for consumers. So all the headwinds that we're already experiencing in terms of the recovery will get worse.\par \par \uc2 That's not my opinion. I think that's a consensus opinion. And that means that job growth will be further stymied, it will be further hampered, as a consequence of that decision. So that's point number one.\par \par \uc2 Point number two, I want to address what I've been hearing from some quarters, which is, well, maybe this debt limit thing is not really that serious; we can just pay interest on the debt. This idea has been floating around in some Republican circles.\par \par \uc2 This is the equivalent of me saying, you know what, I will choose to pay my mortgage, but I'm not going to pay my car note. Or I'm going to pay my car note but I'm not going to pay my student loan. Now, a lot of people in really tough situations are having to make those tough decisions. But for the U.S. government to start picking and choosing like that is not going to inspire a lot of confidence.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, which bills are we going to decide to pay? These guys have said, well, maybe we just pay the interest on -- for bondholders. So are we really going to start paying interest to Chinese who hold treasuries and we're not going to pay folks their Social Security checks? Or we're not going to pay to veterans for their disability checks? I mean, which bills, which obligations, are we going to say we don't have to pay?\par \par \uc2 And last point I want to make about this. These are bills that Congress ran up. The money has been spent. The obligations have been made. So this isn't a situation -- I think the American people have to understand this -- this is not a situation where Congress is going to say, okay, we won't -- we won't buy this car or we won't take this vacation. They took the vacation. They bought the car. And now they're saying maybe we don't have to pay, or we don't have to pay as fast as we said we were going to, or -- that's not how responsible families act. And we're the greatest nation on Earth, and we can't act that way.\par \par \uc2 So this is urgent and it needs to get settled.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So is August 2nd a yellow light or a red light?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: I think people should think of -- look, I'm the President of the United States and I want to make sure that I am not engaging in scare tactics. And I've tried to be responsible and somewhat restrained so that folks don't get spooked.\par \par \uc2 August 2nd is a very important date. And there's no reason why we can't get this done now. We know what the options are out there. This is not a technical problem any longer. This is a matter of Congress going ahead and biting the bullet and making some tough decisions. Because we know what the decisions are. We've identified what spending cuts are possible. We've identified what defense cuts are possible. We've identified what health care cuts are possible. We've identified what loopholes in the tax code can be closed that would also raise revenue. We've identified what the options are. And the question now is are we going to step up and get this done.\par \par \uc2 And, you know, Malia and Sasha generally finish their homework a day ahead of time. Malia is 13, Sasha is 10.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION Impressive.\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: It is impressive. They don't wait until the night before. They're not pulling all-nighters. (Laughter.) They're 13 and 10. Congress can do the same thing. If you know you've got to do something, just do it.\par \par \uc2 And I've got to say, I'm very amused when I start hearing comments about, well, the President needs to show more leadership on this. Let me tell you something. Right after we finished dealing with the government shutdown, averting a government shutdown, I called the leaders here together. I said we've got to get done -- get this done. I put Vice President Biden in charge of a process -- that, by the way, has made real progress -- but these guys have met, worked through all of these issues. I met with every single caucus for an hour to an hour and a half each -- Republican senators, Democratic senators; Republican House, Democratic House. I've met with the leaders multiple times. At a certain point, they need to do their job.\par \par \uc2 And so, this thing, which is just not on the level, where we have meetings and discussions, and we're working through process, and when they decide they're not happy with the fact that at some point you've got to make a choice, they just all step back and say, well, you know, the President needs to get this done -- they need to do their job.\par \par \uc2 Now is the time to go ahead and make the tough choices. That's why they're called leaders. And I've already shown that I'm willing to make some decisions that are very tough and will give my base of voters further reason to give me a hard time. But it's got to be done.\par \par \uc2 And so there's no point in procrastinating. There's no point in putting it off. We've got to get this done. And if by the end of this week, we have not seen substantial progress, then I think members of Congress need to understand we are going to start having to cancel things and stay here until we get it done.\par \par \uc2 They're in one week, they're out one week. And then they're saying, Obama has got to step in. You need to be here. I've been here. I've been doing Afghanistan and bin Laden and the Greek crisis. You stay here. Let's get it done.\par \par \uc2 All right. I think you know my feelings about that. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 Caren Bohan.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. You talked about the payroll tax holiday and possibly extending that. Are you worried, though, that by adding a discussion of short-term measures on the economy into these discussions about long-term deficit reductions that that may complicate the conversation and make it harder to pass a debt limit?\par \par \uc2 MR. OBAMA: I will -- let me put it this way. If we've got a good deal on debt and deficit reduction that focuses not just on the 10-year window but also the long term, we will get it done. And then we can argue about some other things -- because I think that's very important.\par \par \uc2 I will say that precisely because tough votes in Congress are often avoided, that it may make sense to also deal with something like a payroll tax cut at the same time -- because it does have budget implications and the American people need to know that we're focused on jobs and not just on deficit reduction, even though, as I said, deficit reduction helps to serve the job agenda. I think they want to have some confidence that we've got a plan that's helping right now.\par \par \uc2 But I don't think it should be a complicating factor -- because if Mitch McConnell and John Boehner came to me and said, all right, we're ready to make a deal, here's a balanced approach to debt and deficit reduction, but we want to argue about payroll tax cuts later, they're not set to expire until the end of this year -- if that was a situation that they presented, then I think we would have a serious conversation about that. I would not discount that completely.\par \par \uc2 I do think that the steps that I talked about to deal with job growth and economic growth right now are vitally important to deficit reduction. Just as deficit reduction is important to grow the economy and to create jobs -- well, creating jobs and growing the economy also helps reduce the deficit. If we just increased the growth rate by one percentage point, that would drastically bring down the long-term projections of the deficit, because people are paying more into the coffers and fewer people are drawing unemployment insurance. It makes a huge difference.\par \par \uc2 And this may be sort of a good place to wrap up. You know, every day I get letters from folks all around the country who show incredible resilience, incredible determination, but they are having a very, very tough time. They're losing their homes. Some have lost their businesses. Some have lost work and have not been able to find jobs for months, maybe a year, maybe a year and a half. And they feel some desperation. And some folks who are working just are having a tough time paying the bills because they haven't seen their wages or incomes go up in 10 years, and the costs of everything else have gone up.\par \par \uc2 And every day that weighs on me. Every minute of every day that weighs on me. Because I ran for President precisely to make sure that we righted this ship and we start once again creating a situation where middle-class families and people who aspire to be in the middle class, if they're working hard, then they're living a better life.\par \par \uc2 Now, these structural changes in our economy that have been going on for a decade -- in some cases, longer -- they're not going to be solved overnight. But we know what to do. We know that if we are educating our kids well, then they're going to be more competitive. We know that if we are investing in things like infrastructure, it pays off.\par \par \uc2 I was in \uc2 Alcoa\uc2 , in Iowa, one of our most successful companies. They took a big hit during the recession, but they still invested $90 million in new equipment in a plant that makes airplane wings and parts for automobiles. And they've bounced back. They've hired back all their people and are increasing market share because they made those investments.\par \par \uc2 Well, just like a company like \uc2 Alcoa\uc2 , America has got to make some investments. We know that we've got to get control of our deficit. There are some things that aren't going to solve all our problems but can make progress right now. And the question is whether or not Democrats and Republicans are willing to put aside the expedience of short-term politics in order to get it done.\par \par \uc2 And these folks are counting on us. They desperately want to believe that their leadership is thinking about them and not playing games. And I think that if all the leadership here in Washington has the faces and the stories of those families in mind, then we will solve this debt limit issue; we will put in place steps like a payroll tax cut and infrastructure development; we'll continue to fund education; we'll hold true to our commitment to our seniors.\par \par \uc2 These are solvable problems, but it does require us just getting out of the short-term and, frankly, selfish approach that sometimes politics breeds. We've got to think a bit long term.\par \par \uc2 Thank you very much, everybody.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110630e76u0001k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Since then, they have been unable to agree on who should run the Interior and Defense Ministries, the government's two most important departments. PAGE 6\par \par \uc2 DISTRUST SPREADS IN GREECE\par \par \uc2 As the debt crisis in Greece extends into a second year, a growing number of Greeks are turning a critical eye on their government. They are questioning why members of Parliament have immunity from prosecution unless Parliament votes to lift it, and they want to see more transparency and accountability in party financing. PAGE 11\par \par \uc2 ATTEMPTING TALIBAN TALKS\par \par \uc2 President Obama's strategy for gradually ending the war in Afghanistan relies heavily on peace talks with the Taliban. But those talks have hardly begun, and even some administration officials acknowledge that the odds of success are slim. A diplomatic memo. PAGE 9\par \par \uc2 RIVALRY UPENDS UGANDA\par \par \uc2 As Uganda undergoes its most raucous political convulsion in years, with broad-based demonstrations and dissenting officials testing President Yoweri Museveni's 25-year hold on power, the passions from a feud that began long ago with his former friend and doctor, Kizza Besigye, are playing out on the national stage. PAGE 12\par \par \uc2 TRADE PACTS ENABLE LAWSUITS\par \par \uc2 After not receiving a mining permit, the company Pacific Rim is suing the Salvadoran government, one of scores of cases in recent years in which frustrated oil, gas and mining investors, using provisions of free trade agreements, have sought to recoup losses from mostly developing countries. PAGE 6\par \par \uc2 NATIONAL\par \par \uc2 CASEY TRIAL'S DRAMA DRAWS\par \par \uc2 TOURISTS TO CENTRAL FLORIDA\par \par \uc2 By the time Casey Anthony stepped into the courtroom in Orlando, Fla., the line of people outside determined to get a ringside seat had swelled to 60. The drama of the case, in which Ms. Anthony is accused of murdering her daughter in June 2008, has captivated the nation's attention. Page 17\par \par \uc2 LIFE AS A GANGSTER'S GAL\par \par \uc2 From an early age, Catherine Elizabeth Greig had known the life of a moll. She had been a supporting character in the crime drama involving James Bulger, a k a Whitey, always dutifully subordinate, according to acquaintances. Page 23\par \par \uc2 SCRUTINIZING A TRUCK DRIVER\par \par \uc2 Investigators said they planned to look into the driving and medical records of the driver of a semitrailer who died when the truck slammed into an Amtrak train, killing a train crew member and injuring dozens of passengers. A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board said officials would look at autopsy results to determine whether the driver had consumed any drugs around the time of the collision. Page 20\par \par \uc2 OBITUARIES\par \par \uc2 RANDALL DALE ADAMS, 61\par \par \uc2 Mr. Adams spent 12 years in prison before his conviction in the murder of a Dallas police officer was thrown out largely on the basis of evidence uncovered by a filmmaker. He died in obscurity in October in Washington Court House, Ohio. Page 26\par \par \uc2 ERIC SWENSON, 64\par \par \uc2 He was the founder of Thrasher, a magazine that re-energized the sport of skateboarding and helped propel it from a suburban teenage activity to an international form of recreation and a competitive sport. He and his partner started Thrasher in 1981. PAGE 26\par \par \uc2 SPORTS\par \par \uc2 VETERAN YANKEE HONORED,\par \par \uc2 DUBIOUS RECORD AND ALL\par \par \uc2 George Frazier set a less-than-stellar record on baseball's biggest stage, becoming the first pitcher in major league history to lose three games in a best-of-seven World Series while playing for the Yankees, but George Steinbrenner consoled him anyway. Now, 30 years later, Mr. Frazier will wear the Yankees' uniform again, in his first appearance at Old-Timers' Day. Page 1\par \par \uc2 PITCHES AND ROOT CANALS\par \par \uc2 For many players in baseball, the maddening act of trying to hit the knuckleballs thrown by R. A. Dickey and Tim Wakefield is akin to having teeth pulled. And for many patients in the Dallas area, facing Dickey and Wakefield means a tooth extraction. But the second pairing are dentists, not pitchers, and the names are just a funny coincidence. Page 3\par \par \uc2 U.S. CONFRONTS CONTENDERS\par \par \uc2 The days of dominance for the United States women's national team -- when it could count on defeating opponents with sheer athleticism -- have passed. The women's game has evolved, and teams around the world are showing greater skill and tactical sophistication. PAGE 7\par \par \uc2 METROPOLITAN\par \par \uc2 SCHOOL IS OUT,\par \par \uc2 THIS TIME FOR GOOD\par \par \uc2 Just don't cry. That has been Sister Nora McArt's mantra. She has been unflappable in her 42 years at St. Martin of Tours Elementary School in the Bronx, braving the gang fights, racial unrest and crack wars that were waged outside the school and convent in the Crotona neighborhood. No matter the mayhem, she had to be calm for the children. Until now. Her school is closing. Page 1\par \par \uc2 SUNDAY BUSINESS\par \par \uc2 IN MEDICINE, NEW AND FRESH ARE NOT ALWAYS BETTER\par \par \uc2 It is an American impulse to covet the new and improved, and so too in medicine. New drugs, devices and procedures have advanced patient care. But the promise of innovation can also prove a trap, a situation now playing out with dire consequences for possibly tens of thousands of people who received artificial hips intended to let them remain active. Page 1\par \par \uc2 FEUDING OVER AN AD PARODY\par \par \uc2 One incompetent young salesman in a short-sleeved blue shirt. That's about all Newegg, an online retailer, needed to create a hilarious parody commercial, that seemed to be lampooning a certain consumer electronics giant. \uc2 Best Buy\uc2  was not amused.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 One August morning nearly two decades ago, my mother woke me and put me in a cab. She handed me a jacket. ''Baka malamig doon'' were among the few words she said. (''It might be cold there.'') When I arrived at the Philippines' Ninoy Aquino International Airport with her, my aunt and a family friend, I was introduced to a man I'd never seen. They told me he was my uncle. He held my hand as I boarded an airplane for the first time. It was 1993, and I was 12.\par \par \uc2 My mother wanted to give me a better life, so she sent me thousands of miles away to live with her parents in America -- my grandfather (Lolo in Tagalog) and grandmother (Lola). After I arrived in Mountain View, Calif., in the San Francisco Bay Area, I entered sixth grade and quickly grew to love my new home, family and culture. I discovered a passion for language, though it was hard to learn the difference between formal English and American slang. One of my early memories is of a freckled kid in middle school asking me, ''What's up?'' I replied, ''The sky,'' and he and a couple of other kids laughed. I won the eighth-grade spelling bee by memorizing words I couldn't properly pronounce. (The winning word was ''indefatigable.'')\par \par \uc2 One day when I was 16, I rode my bike to the nearby D.M.V. office to get my driver's permit. Some of my friends already had their licenses, so I figured it was time. But when I handed the clerk my green card as proof of U.S. residency, she flipped it around, examining it. ''This is fake,'' she whispered. ''Don't come back here again.''\par \par \uc2 Confused and scared, I pedaled home and confronted Lolo. I remember him sitting in the garage, cutting coupons. I dropped my bike and ran over to him, showing him the green card. ''Peke ba ito?'' I asked in Tagalog. (''Is this fake?'') My grandparents were naturalized American citizens -- he worked as a security guard, she as a food server -- and they had begun supporting my mother and me financially when I was 3, after my father's wandering eye and inability to properly provide for us led to my parents' separation. Lolo was a proud man, and I saw the shame on his face as he told me he purchased the card, along with other fake documents, for me. ''Don't show it to other people,'' he warned.\par \par \uc2 I decided then that I could never give anyone reason to doubt I was an American. I convinced myself that if I worked enough, if I achieved enough, I would be rewarded with citizenship. I felt I could earn it.\par \par \uc2 I've tried. Over the past 14 years, I've graduated from high school and college and built a career as a journalist, interviewing some of the most famous people in the country. On the surface, I've created a good life. I've lived the American dream.\par \par \uc2 But I am still an undocumented immigrant. And that means living a different kind of reality. It means going about my day in fear of being found out. It means rarely trusting people, even those closest to me, with who I really am. It means keeping my family photos in a shoebox rather than displaying them on shelves in my home, so friends don't ask about them. It means reluctantly, even painfully, doing things I know are wrong and unlawful. And it has meant relying on a sort of 21st-century underground railroad of supporters, people who took an interest in my future and took risks for me.\par \par \uc2 Last year I read about four students who walked from Miami to Washington to lobby for the Dream Act, a nearly decade-old immigration bill that would provide a path to legal permanent residency for young people who have been educated in this country. At the risk of deportation -- the Obama administration has deported almost 800,000 people in the last two years -- they are speaking out. Their courage has inspired me.\par \par \uc2 There are believed to be 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. We're not always who you think we are. Some pick your strawberries or care for your children. Some are in high school or college. And some, it turns out, write news articles you might read. I grew up here. This is my home. Yet even though I think of myself as an American and consider America my country, my country doesn't think of me as one of its own.\par \par \uc2 My first challenge was the language. Though I learned English in the Philippines, I wanted to lose my accent. During high school, I spent hours at a time watching television (especially ''Frasier,'' ''Home Improvement'' and reruns of ''The Golden Girls'') and movies (from ''Goodfellas'' to ''Anne of Green Gables''), pausing the VHS to try to copy how various characters enunciated their words. At the local library, I read magazines, books and newspapers -- anything to learn how to write better. Kathy Dewar, my high-school English teacher, introduced me to journalism. From the moment I wrote my first article for the student paper, I convinced myself that having my name in print -- writing in English, interviewing Americans -- validated my presence here.\par \par \uc2 The debates over ''illegal aliens'' intensified my anxieties. In 1994, only a year after my flight from the Philippines, Gov. Pete Wilson was re-elected in part because of his support for Proposition 187, which prohibited undocumented immigrants from attending public school and accessing other services. (A federal court later found the law unconstitutional.) After my encounter at the D.M.V. in 1997, I grew more aware of anti-immigrant sentiments and stereotypes: they don't want to assimilate, they are a drain on society. They're not talking about me, I would tell myself. I have something to contribute.\par \par \uc2 To do that, I had to work -- and for that, I needed a Social Security number. Fortunately, my grandfather had already managed to get one for me. Lolo had always taken care of everyone in the family. He and my grandmother emigrated legally in 1984 from Zambales, a province in the Philippines of rice fields and bamboo houses/, following Lolo's sister, who married a Filipino-American serving in the American military. She petitioned for her brother and his wife to join her. When they got here, Lolo petitioned for his two children -- my mother and her younger brother -- to follow them. But instead of mentioning that my mother was a married woman, he listed her as single. Legal residents can't petition for their married children. Besides, Lolo didn't care for my father. He didn't want him coming here too.\par \par \uc2 But soon Lolo grew nervous that the immigration authorities reviewing the petition would discover my mother was married, thus derailing not only her chances of coming here but those of my uncle as well. So he withdrew her petition. After my uncle came to America legally in 1991, Lolo tried to get my mother here through a tourist visa, but she wasn't able to obtain one. That's when she decided to send me. My mother told me later that she figured she would follow me soon. She never did.\par \par \uc2 The ''uncle'' who brought me here turned out to be a coyote, not a relative, my grandfather later explained. Lolo scraped together enough money -- I eventually learned it was $4,500, a huge sum for him -- to pay him to smuggle me here under a fake name and fake passport. (I never saw the passport again after the flight and have always assumed that the coyote kept it.) After I arrived in America, Lolo obtained a new fake Filipino passport, in my real name this time, adorned with a fake student visa, in addition to the fraudulent green card.\par \par \uc2 Using the fake passport, we went to the local Social Security Administration office and applied for a Social Security number and card. It was, I remember, a quick visit. When the card came in the mail, it had my full, real name, but it also clearly stated: ''Valid for work only with I.N.S. authorization.''\par \par \uc2 When I began looking for work, a short time after the D.M.V. incident, my grandfather and I took the Social Security card to Kinko's, where he covered the ''I.N.S. authorization'' text with a sliver of white tape. We then made photocopies of the card. At a glance, at least, the copies would look like copies of a regular, unrestricted Social Security card.\par \par \uc2 Lolo always imagined I would work the kind of low-paying jobs that undocumented people often take. (Once I married an American, he said, I would get my real papers, and everything would be fine.) But even menial jobs require documents, so he and I hoped the doctored card would work for now. The more documents I had, he said, the better.\par \par \uc2 While in high school, I worked part time at Subway, then at the front desk of the local Y.M.C.A., then at a tennis club, until I landed an unpaid internship at The Mountain View Voice, my hometown newspaper. First I brought coffee and helped around the office; eventually I began covering city-hall meetings and other assignments for pay.\par \par \uc2 For more than a decade of getting part-time and full-time jobs, employers have rarely asked to check my original Social Security card. When they did, I showed the photocopied version, which they accepted. Over time, I also began checking the citizenship box on my federal I-9 employment eligibility forms. (Claiming full citizenship was actually easier than declaring permanent resident ''green card'' status, which would have required me to provide an alien registration number.)\par \par \uc2 This deceit never got easier. The more I did it, the more I felt like an impostor, the more guilt I carried -- and the more I worried that I would get caught. But I kept doing it. I needed to live and survive on my own, and I decided this was the way.\par \par \uc2 Mountain View High School became my second home. I was elected to represent my school at school-board meetings, which gave me the chance to meet and befriend Rich Fischer, the superintendent for our school district. I joined the speech and debate team, acted in school plays and eventually became co-editor of The \uc2 Oracle\uc2 , the student newspaper. That drew the attention of my principal, Pat Hyland. ''You're at school just as much as I am,'' she told me. Pat and Rich would soon become mentors, and over time, almost surrogate parents for me.\par \par \uc2 After a choir rehearsal during my junior year, Jill Denny, the choir director, told me she was considering a Japan trip for our singing group. I told her I couldn't afford it, but she said we'd figure out a way. I hesitated, and then decided to tell her the truth. ''It's not really the money,'' I remember saying. ''I don't have the right passport.'' When she assured me we'd get the proper documents, I finally told her. ''I can't get the right passport,'' I said. ''I'm not supposed to be here.''\par \par \uc2 She understood. So the choir toured Hawaii instead, with me in tow. (Mrs. Denny and I spoke a couple of months ago, and she told me she hadn't wanted to leave any student behind.)\par \par \uc2 Later that school year, my history class watched a documentary on Harvey Milk, the openly gay San Francisco city official who was assassinated. This was 1999, just six months after Matthew Shepard's body was found tied to a fence in Wyoming. During the discussion, I raised my hand and said something like: ''I'm sorry Harvey Milk got killed for being gay. . . . I've been meaning to say this. . . . I'm gay.''\par \par \uc2 I hadn't planned on coming out that morning, though I had known that I was gay for several years. With that announcement, I became the only openly gay student at school, and it caused turmoil with my grandparents. Lolo kicked me out of the house for a few weeks. Though we eventually reconciled, I had disappointed him on two fronts. First, as a Catholic, he considered homosexuality a sin and was embarrassed about having ''ang apo na bakla'' (''a grandson who is gay''). Even worse, I was making matters more difficult for myself, he said. I needed to marry an American woman in order to gain a green card.\par \par \uc2 Tough as it was, coming out about being gay seemed less daunting than coming out about my legal status. I kept my other secret mostly hidden.\par \par \uc2 While my classmates awaited their college acceptance letters, I hoped to get a full-time job at The Mountain View Voice after graduation. It's not that I didn't want to go to college, but I couldn't apply for state and federal financial aid. Without that, my family couldn't afford to send me.\par \par \uc2 But when I finally told Pat and Rich about my immigration ''problem'' -- as we called it from then on -- they helped me look for a solution. At first, they even wondered if one of them could adopt me and fix the situation that way, but a lawyer Rich consulted told him it wouldn't change my legal status because I was too old. Eventually they connected me to a new scholarship fund for high-potential students who were usually the first in their families to attend college. Most important, the fund was not concerned with immigration status. I was among the first recipients, with the scholarship covering tuition, lodging, books and other expenses for my studies at San Francisco State University.\par \par \uc2 As a college freshman, I found a job working part time at The San Francisco Chronicle, where I sorted mail and wrote some freelance articles. My ambition was to get a reporting job, so I embarked on a series of internships. First I landed at The Philadelphia Daily News, in the summer of 2001, where I covered a drive-by shooting and the wedding of the 76ers star Allen Iverson. Using those articles, I applied to The Seattle Times and got an internship for the following summer.\par \par \uc2 But then my lack of proper documents became a problem again. The Times's recruiter, Pat Foote, asked all incoming interns to bring certain paperwork on their first day: a birth certificate, or a passport, or a driver's license plus an original Social Security card. I panicked, thinking my documents wouldn't pass muster. So before starting the job, I called Pat and told her about my legal status. After consulting with management, she called me back with the answer I feared: I couldn't do the internship.\par \par \uc2 This was devastating. What good was college if I couldn't then pursue the career I wanted? I decided then that if I was to succeed in a profession that is all about truth-telling, I couldn't tell the truth about myself.\par \par \uc2 After this episode, Jim Strand, the venture capitalist who sponsored my scholarship, offered to pay for an immigration lawyer. Rich and I went to meet her in San Francisco's financial district.\par \par \uc2 I was hopeful. This was in early 2002, shortly after Senators Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican, and Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat, introduced the Dream Act -- Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors. It seemed like the legislative version of what I'd told myself: If I work hard and contribute, things will work out.\par \par \uc2 But the meeting left me crushed. My only solution, the lawyer said, was to go back to the Philippines and accept a 10-year ban before I could apply to return legally.\par \par \uc2 If Rich was discouraged, he hid it well. ''Put this problem on a shelf,'' he told me. ''Compartmentalize it. Keep going.''\par \par \uc2 And I did. For the summer of 2003, I applied for internships across the country. Several newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal, The Boston Globe and The Chicago Tribune, expressed interest. But when The Washington Post offered me a spot, I knew where I would go. And this time, I had no intention of acknowledging my ''problem.''\par \par \uc2 The Post internship posed a tricky obstacle: It required a driver's license. (After my close call at the California D.M.V., I'd never gotten one.) So I spent an afternoon at The Mountain View Public Library, studying various states' requirements. Oregon was among the most welcoming -- and it was just a few hours' drive north.\par \par \uc2 Again, my support network came through. A friend's father lived in Portland, and he allowed me to use his address as proof of residency. Pat, Rich and Rich's longtime assistant, Mary Moore, sent letters to me at that address. Rich taught me how to do three-point turns in a parking lot, and a friend accompanied me to Portland.\par \par \uc2 The license meant everything to me -- it would let me drive, fly and work. But my grandparents worried about the Portland trip and the Washington internship. While Lola offered daily prayers so that I would not get caught, Lolo told me that I was dreaming too big, risking too much.\par \par \uc2 I was determined to pursue my ambitions. I was 22, I told them, responsible for my own actions. But this was different from Lolo's driving a confused teenager to Kinko's. I knew what I was doing now, and I knew it wasn't right. But what was I supposed to do?\par \par \uc2 I was paying state and federal taxes, but I was using an invalid Social Security card and writing false information on my employment forms. But that seemed better than depending on my grandparents or on Pat, Rich and Jim -- or returning to a country I barely remembered. I convinced myself all would be O.K. if I lived up to the qualities of a ''citizen'': hard work, self-reliance, love of my country.\par \par \uc2 At the D.M.V. in Portland, I arrived with my photocopied Social Security card, my college I.D., a pay stub from The San Francisco Chronicle and my proof of state residence -- the letters to the Portland address that my support network had sent. It worked. My license, issued in 2003, was set to expire eight years later, on my 30th birthday, on Feb. 3, 2011. I had eight years to succeed professionally, and to hope that some sort of immigration reform would pass in the meantime and allow me to stay.\par \par \uc2 It seemed like all the time in the world.\par \par \uc2 My summer in Washington was exhilarating. I was intimidated to be in a major newsroom but was assigned a mentor -- Peter Perl, a veteran magazine writer -- to help me navigate it. A few weeks into the internship, he printed out one of my articles, about a guy who recovered a long-lost wallet, circled the first two paragraphs and left it on my desk. ''Great eye for details -- awesome!'' he wrote. Though I didn't know it then, Peter would become one more member of my network.\par \par \uc2 At the end of the summer, I returned to The San Francisco Chronicle. My plan was to finish school -- I was now a senior -- while I worked for The Chronicle as a reporter for the city desk. But when The Post beckoned again, offering me a full-time, two-year paid internship that I could start when I graduated in June 2004, it was too tempting to pass up. I moved back to Washington.\par \par \uc2 About four months into my job as a reporter for The Post, I began feeling increasingly paranoid, as if I had ''\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 '' tattooed on my forehead -- and in Washington, of all places, where the debates over immigration seemed never-ending. I was so eager to prove myself that I feared I was annoying some colleagues and editors -- and worried that any one of these professional journalists could discover my secret. The anxiety was nearly paralyzing. I decided I had to tell one of the higher-ups about my situation. I turned to Peter.\par \par \uc2 By this time, Peter, who still works at The Post, had become part of management as the paper's director of newsroom training and professional development. One afternoon in late October, we walked a couple of blocks to Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Over some 20 minutes, sitting on a bench, I told him everything: the Social Security card, the driver's license, Pat and Rich, my family.\par \par \uc2 Peter was shocked. ''I understand you 100 times better now,'' he said. He told me that I had done the right thing by telling him, and that it was now our shared problem. He said he didn't want to do anything about it just yet. I had just been hired, he said, and I needed to prove myself. ''When you've done enough,'' he said, ''we'll tell Don and Len together.'' (Don Graham is the chairman of \uc2 The Washington Post Company\uc2 ; \uc2 Leonard Downie Jr\uc2 . was then the paper's executive editor.) A month later, I spent my first Thanksgiving in Washington with Peter and his family.\par \par \uc2 In the five years that followed, I did my best to ''do enough.'' I was promoted to staff writer, reported on video-game culture, wrote a series on Washington's H.I.V./AIDS epidemic and covered the role of technology and social media in the 2008 presidential race. I visited the White House, where I interviewed senior aides and covered a state dinner -- and gave the Secret Service the Social Security number I obtained with false documents.\par \par \uc2 I did my best to steer clear of reporting on immigration policy but couldn't always avoid it. On two occasions, I wrote about Hillary Clinton's position on driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants. I also wrote an article about Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who was defending his party's stance toward Latinos after only one Republican presidential candidate -- John McCain, the co-author of a failed immigration bill -- agreed to participate in a debate sponsored by Univision, the Spanish-language network.\par \par \uc2 It was an odd sort of dance: I was trying to stand out in a highly competitive newsroom, yet I was terrified that if I stood out too much, I'd invite unwanted scrutiny. I tried to compartmentalize my fears, distract myself by reporting on the lives of other people, but there was no escaping the central conflict in my life. Maintaining a deception for so long distorts your sense of self. You start wondering who you've become, and why.\par \par \uc2 In April 2008, I was part of a Post team that won a Pulitzer Prize for the paper's coverage of the Virginia Tech shootings a year earlier. Lolo died a year earlier, so it was Lola who called me the day of the announcement. The first thing she said was, ''Anong mangyayari kung malaman ng mga tao?''\par \par \uc2 What will happen if people find out?\par \par \uc2 I couldn't say anything. After we got off the phone, I rushed to the bathroom on the fourth floor of the newsroom, sat down on the toilet and cried.\par \par \uc2 In the summer of 2009, without ever having had that follow-up talk with top Post management, I left the paper and moved to New York to join The Huffington Post. I met Arianna Huffington at a Washington Press Club Foundation dinner I was covering for The Post two years earlier, and she later recruited me to join her news site. I wanted to learn more about Web publishing, and I thought the new job would provide a useful education.\par \par \uc2 Still, I was apprehensive about the move: many companies were already using E-Verify, a program set up by the Department of Homeland Security that checks if prospective employees are eligible to work, and I didn't know if my new employer was among them. But I'd been able to get jobs in other newsrooms, I figured, so I filled out the paperwork as usual and succeeded in landing on the payroll.\par \par \uc2 While I worked at The Huffington Post, other opportunities emerged. My H.I.V./AIDS series became a documentary film called ''The Other City,'' which opened at the Tribeca Film Festival last year and was broadcast on Showtime. I began writing for magazines and landed a dream assignment: profiling \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's Mark Zuckerberg for The New Yorker.\par \par \uc2 The more I achieved, the more scared and depressed I became. I was proud of my work, but there was always a cloud hanging over it, over me. My old eight-year deadline -- the expiration of my Oregon driver's license -- was approaching.\par \par \uc2 After slightly less than a year, I decided to leave The Huffington Post. In part, this was because I wanted to promote the documentary and write a book about online culture -- or so I told my friends. But the real reason was, after so many years of trying to be a part of the system, of focusing all my energy on my professional life, I learned that no amount of professional success would solve my problem or ease the sense of loss and displacement I felt. I lied to a friend about why I couldn't take a weekend trip to Mexico. Another time I concocted an excuse for why I couldn't go on an all-expenses-paid trip to Switzerland. I have been unwilling, for years, to be in a long-term relationship because I never wanted anyone to get too close and ask too many questions. All the while, Lola's question was stuck in my head: What will happen if people find out?\par \par \uc2 Early this year, just two weeks before my 30th birthday, I won a small reprieve: I obtained a driver's license in the state of Washington. The license is valid until 2016. This offered me five more years of acceptable identification -- but also five more years of fear, of lying to people I respect and institutions that trusted me, of running away from who I am.\par \par \uc2 I'm done running. I'm exhausted. I don't want that life anymore.\par \par \uc2 So I've decided to come forward, own up to what I've done, and tell my story to the best of my recollection. I've reached out to former bosses/ and employers and apologized for misleading them -- a mix of humiliation and liberation coming with each disclosure. All the people mentioned in this article gave me permission to use their names. I've also talked to family and friends about my situation and am working with legal counsel to review my options. I don't know what the consequences will be of telling my story.\par \par \uc2 I do know that I am grateful to my grandparents, my Lolo and Lola, for giving me the chance for a better life. I'm also grateful to my other family -- the support network I found here in America -- for encouraging me to pursue my dreams.\par \par \uc2 It's been almost 18 years since I've seen my mother. Early on, I was mad at her for putting me in this position, and then mad at myself for being angry and ungrateful. By the time I got to college, we rarely spoke by phone. It became too painful; after a while it was easier to just send money to help support her and my two half-siblings. My sister, almost 2 years old when I left, is almost 20 now. I've never met my 14-year-old brother. I would love to see them.\par \par \uc2 Not long ago, I called my mother. I wanted to fill the gaps in my memory about that August morning so many years ago. We had never discussed it. Part of me wanted to shove the memory aside, but to write this article and face the facts of my life, I needed more details. Did I cry? Did she? Did we kiss goodbye?\par \par \uc2 My mother told me I was excited about meeting a stewardess, about getting on a plane. She also reminded me of the one piece of advice she gave me for blending in: If anyone asked why I was coming to America, I should say I was going to Disneyland.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY RYAN PFLUGER) (MM23); Staying Papers: The documentation that Vargas obtained over the years -- a fake green card, a fake passport, a driver's license -- allowed him to remain in the U.S. In Oregon, a friend provided a mailing address.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Moving to repair an immigration enforcement program that has drawn rising opposition from governors and police chiefs, senior immigration officials on Friday announced steps they said would focus the program more closely on deporting immigrants convicted of serious crimes.\par \par \uc2 In unveiling the changes, John Morton, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the deportation program would continue to expand as planned in order to be operating nationwide by 2013, despite criticism from many police chiefs and from the governors of Illinois, New York and Massachusetts, who sought to withdraw their states.\par \par \uc2 But in making course corrections to the program, known as Secure Communities, Mr. Morton acknowledged the groundswell of local resistance, including opposition from Latino and immigrant groups, to an effort that is central to President Obama's approach to controlling illegal immigration. Critics said the program was casting too wide a net and had strayed from its goal of bolstering public safety by expelling illegal immigrants who committed the most dangerous crimes.\par \par \uc2 In a fix likely to have broad practical effect, Mr. Morton issued a memorandum that greatly expanded the factors immigration authorities can take into account in deciding to defer or cancel deportations. Agents are now formally urged to consider how long an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has been in the United States, or whether the immigrant was brought here illegally as a child and is studying in high school or college.\par \par \uc2 In practice, the memorandum gives immigration agents authority to postpone or cancel, on a case by case basis, deportations of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who might have been eligible for legal status under a bill stalled in Congress that is known as the Dream Act.\par \par \uc2 The authorities are also instructed to give ''particular care and consideration'' to veterans and active duty members of the military, especially if they have been in combat, and to their close relatives.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Morton also expanded the authority of federal lawyers who handle cases in immigration courts to dismiss deportation proceedings against immigrants without serious criminal records.\par \par \uc2 Also on Friday, Mr. Obama extended the deployment of some 1,200 National Guard troops who are backing up immigration agents along the Southwest border.\par \par \uc2 Under Secure Communities, tens of thousands of immigrants who were here illegally but had not been convicted of any crime were detained by local law enforcement and swept into deportation proceedings. Until now, once immigration agents in the field had started a deportation, government lawyers had little authority to decide which cases were worth pursuing in immigration court. Many immigration violations are civil, not criminal, offenses.\par \par \uc2 In the Secure Communities program, fingerprints of everyone who is booked into jail are checked against F.B.I. criminal databases, as has long been routine, and also against Department of Homeland Security databases, which record immigration violations. Homeland Security officials report results of fingerprint checks back to the arresting police departments, and federal immigration agents determine whether to detain the immigrants for deportation.\par \par \uc2 ''We believe in this program, we think it's the right program, and we intend to continue it,'' Mr. Morton said on Friday. ''But obviously we are listening to the concerns raised by the governors, members of Congress and community groups.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Morton also said he would form an advisory commission of police chiefs, sheriffs, state and local prosecutors, immigration agents, and immigrant advocates. The first task of the commission would be to assess, within 45 days, another fix Mr. Morton is considering.\par \par \uc2 Currently all immigrants who are flagged in a Secure Communities fingerprint check can be detained for deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from the time they are first booked into jail. Mr. Morton said that under his proposal, illegal immigrants who were arrested for minor traffic offenses, like driving without a license, and other minor misdemeanors, would not be detained for deportation until they were convicted of those crimes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Morton also issued new guidelines he said would ensure that illegal immigrants detained by the police who were victims of domestic violence and witnesses to crimes would not be deported.\par \par \uc2 Immigration lawyers praised the new ground rules. ''If these standards are applied consistently, it would allow ICE to focus government resources on dangerous criminals and national security risks to make America safer, a goal we all share,'' said David Leopold, the outgoing president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\par \par \uc2 But several community groups rejected the changes as cosmetic tweaks that would do little to slow deportations that they said had separated immigrant families without reducing crime.\par \par \uc2 ''This program is riddled with flaws and the announcement today acknowledges that,'' said Chris Newman, general counsel of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. He said the program should be suspended until the Homeland Security inspector general completes a review later this year.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110618e76i0006z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Gov. Robert Bentley signed a tough immigration law on Thursday, and several civil rights groups said they would sue to stop it from taking effect. The law, which goes beyond an immigration enforcement bill Arizona adopted last year, requires public schools to determine the immigration status of all students starting in kindergarten and makes it a crime to knowingly give a ride in a vehicle to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . It requires police officers to inquire about the status of anyone they stop if they suspect the person might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Calling the law extreme, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union said they were preparing a lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110610e76a0004w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has decided the state will not participate in a fingerprint-sharing program that is central to the Obama administration's immigration enforcement strategy, dealing a new political blow to a program that has met rising resistance nationwide.\par \par \uc2 Massachusetts is the third state to pull out of the program, called Secure Communities, after Gov. Pat Quinn canceled it in Illinois in May and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo suspended New York's participation last week. All three are Democrats from states with large immigrant populations, and they are close allies of President Obama, including on immigration issues.\par \par \uc2 The governors' actions seem to set up a confrontation with immigration authorities, who maintain that the program is mandatory.\par \par \uc2 In a June 3 letter, the Massachusetts secretary of public safety and security, Mary Elizabeth Heffernan, said Mr. Patrick had concluded that he should not sign any agreement to join the program because it was not accomplishing its goal of deporting immigrants who were convicted of serious crimes. Ms. Heffernan also wrote that state law enforcement officials feared that the program was ''overly broad and may deter the reporting of criminal activity.''\par \par \uc2 She rebuked Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that runs the program, for sending ''conflicting messages'' about how it would operate in Massachusetts and whether states were required to join.\par \par \uc2 ''We are reluctant to participate if the program is mandatory and unwilling to participate if it is voluntary,'' she wrote.\par \par \uc2 Officials from the enforcement agency have acknowledged that they did a poor job of explaining the program to state officials, at one point suggesting that it might be voluntary.\par \par \uc2 A Department of Homeland Security official said that the authorities would continue to expand the Secure Communities program, including in Massachusetts, because it was required by a federal law passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that addresses the sharing of information between the F.B.I. and immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 ''We are not going to stop this program because of the governors,'' said the official, who spoke anonymously in order to provide insight into a policy decision. ''It is a program that is mandated by law that has the support of the administration and the Congress.''\par \par \uc2 In the most recent budget, he said, Congress cut many Homeland Security Department programs but added to the budget sought for Secure Communities.\par \par \uc2 Under the program, everyone who is booked into jail, immigrants and citizens, would have their fingerprints checked against F.B.I. criminal databases, as is routine, and also against Department of Homeland Security databases of immigration violations.\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities, initiated in 2008 under the administration of President George W. Bush, has expanded rapidly under the Obama administration, and is operating in 1,331 local jurisdictions in 42 states, according to official figures. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has said the program must be operating nationwide by 2013.\par \par \uc2 In Massachusetts, Mr. Patrick said last December that he was inclined to join the program, in part because he believed the state had no choice. In a half-dozen sometimes stormy public meetings across the state, immigrant organizations spoke out against the program, saying it was sweeping up \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers who had not committed crimes and had family members who were in the United States legally.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the program also turned out, making it clear that immigration could become a sharply divisive issue even in Massachusetts, with its deep tradition of immigration.\par \par \uc2 Separate from state authorities, Boston started a Secure Communities pilot program in 2008. Official figures from Boston showed that 54 percent of the immigrants deported under the program had no criminal convictions, only civil immigration violations. Only about one in four deportees under the program had been convicted of a serious crime, according to the figures.\par \par \uc2 Massachusetts officials said that Mr. Patrick was eager to avoid any clash with Mr. Obama over immigration, but would press him to try to pass an overhaul of immigration laws that would include legal status for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ''The governor believes, as the president does, in the need for comprehensive immigration reform at the federal level,'' said Alex Goldstein, Mr. Patrick's spokesman.\par \par \uc2 Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, said, ''I have to credit Governor Patrick for focusing on the problems and not the politics of this program.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110607e7670006m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Alabama has passed a sweeping bill to crack down on illegal immigrants that both supporters and opponents call the toughest of its kind in the country, going well beyond a law Arizona passed last year that caused a furor there.\par \par \uc2 The measure was passed by large margins in the Alabama Senate and the House, both Republican-controlled, in votes on Thursday. Governor Robert Bentley, a Republican, is expected to sign the bill into law.\par \par \uc2 ''Alabama is now the new No. 1 state for immigration enforcement,'' said Kris Kobach, a constitutional lawyer who is secretary of state in Kansas. He has helped write many state bills to curtail illegal immigration, including Alabama's.\par \par \uc2 ''This bill invites discrimination into every aspect of the lives of people in Alabama,'' said Cecillia Wang, director of the immigrants' rights project of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has brought legal challenges against several state immigration-control laws. Calling Alabama's bill ''outrageous and blatantly unconstitutional,'' Ms. Wang said, ''We will take action if the governor signs it.''\par \par \uc2 The Alabama bill includes a provision similar to one that stirred controversy in Arizona, authorizing state and local police officers to ask about the immigration status of anyone they stop based on a ''reasonable suspicion'' the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Federal courts have suspended most of that Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's bill goes beyond Arizona's. It bars illegal immigrants from enrolling in any public college after high school. It obliges public schools to determine the immigration status of all students, requiring parents of foreign-born students to report the immigration status of their children.\par \par \uc2 The bill requires Alabama's public schools to publish figures on the number of immigrants -- both legal and illegal -- who are enrolled and on any costs associated with the education of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children.\par \par \uc2 The bill, known as H.B. 56, also makes it a crime to knowingly rent housing to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . It bars businesses from taking tax deductions on wages paid to unauthorized immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a jobs-creation bill for Americans,'' said Representative Micky Hammon, a Republican who was a chief sponsor of the bill. ''We really want to prevent illegal immigrants from coming to Alabama and to prevent those who are here from putting down roots,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The Alabama bill comes at the end of a legislative season when many states wrestled with immigration crackdown proposals. Measures focusing only on enforcement failed in 16 states, according to a tally by the National Immigration Forum in Washington, a group opposing such laws.\par \par \uc2 In May, Georgia adopted a tough enforcement law, which civil rights groups filed a lawsuit on Thursday seeking to stop. Proponents of state immigration enforcement laws won a major victory last week when the Supreme Court upheld a 2007 law in Arizona imposing penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's law includes some provisions similar to the Arizona statute that courts rejected as incursions on legal terrain reserved for the federal government. But Michael Hethmon, general counsel of the Immigration Reform Law Institute in Washington, said the Alabama bill was a compendium of measures against illegal immigrants that his group had tested in other states. Mr. Hethmon's group is the legal arm of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks to reduce immigration.\par \par \uc2 The bill requires all Alabama employers to use a federal system, E-Verify, to confirm the legal status of all workers. The measure also makes it a state crime for an immigrant to fail to carry a document proving legal status, and makes it a crime for anyone to transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110604e7640008t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc41}{\*\bkmkend toc41}\b \uc2 As Arizona Fire Rages, So Does Rumor on Its Origin\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARC LACEY   \par \uc2 982 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 June 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PORTAL, Ariz. -- It is a dramatic tale: that illegal immigrants being pursued by the Border Patrol started one of the nation's largest wildfires, which has burned up more than 70,000 acres of national forest along Arizona's border with Mexico since it began almost four weeks ago. But the authorities say that despite the tale's being repeated often by some residents of the rugged countryside here, they do not know for sure if it is true.\par \par \uc2 ''Sometimes you can find the true cause and other times you can't,'' said Bill Edwards, the lead ranger at the Coronado National Forest, who told residents at a community meeting on Tuesday night that the so-called Horseshoe 2 Fire was caused by humans but that investigators had not determined who caused it. ''Everything else is speculation.''\par \par \uc2 Border security is such a dominant issue in Arizona that it pops up in many contexts, wildfires included. Because fires surge across the border, from Mexico to the United States and vice versa, fighting them presents added logistical challenges in this part of the country. Already this year, a particularly fierce one for fires, dozens of United States Forest Service firefighters have crossed into Mexico with special clearances to try to control fires before they reach the United States.\par \par \uc2 The Horseshoe 2 fire began on May 8 in Horseshoe Canyon, well north of the border, but many residents still link the blaze directly to Mexico. They point out that most border crossings occur at night, when it is cold in the mountains and the migrants are likely to start fires for warmth. With the high winds, low humidity and extremely dry conditions in the forest right now, the likelihood of a campfire getting out of control is especially great.\par \par \uc2 The story of how it started, so vivid in some accounts that it sounds as if witnesses were peering through the brush as matches were thrown, comes up often in conversations here and was repeated in an open letter that ranchers wrote to President Obama recently, criticizing him as not adequately securing the border.\par \par \uc2 ''You hear people talk about it like they were there,'' said Helen Snyder, a retired biologist who settled here 25 years ago. ''Some of them even say that the illegal immigrants that started the fire were being pursued by the Border Patrol and that they set the fire maliciously to get away. Now wouldn't the Border Patrol have called in the fire?''\par \par \uc2 A Border Patrol spokeswoman referred questions about how the fire started to the Forest Service, which said that lightning had been ruled out but that the investigation was continuing.\par \par \uc2 ''We have trained investigators who are trying to determine how it started,'' said Dugger Hughes, the incident commander for the fire, who is based just across the Arizona state line in Rodeo, N.M. ''It's like any arson investigation. They look at burn patterns and they work it back to a tight spot to determine where it began.''\par \par \uc2 That spot is now marked on Forest Service maps with a red X, with shaded areas representing burnt forest extending in all directions. The fire is now 75 percent contained, firefighters said Wednesday, as smoke from controlled burns billowed up into the clouds.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hughes acknowledged that relatively few suspects were located in wildfire investigations, but said that when they were found, they faced criminal and civil penalties, including the cost of the firefighting operation, which in the case of the Horseshoe 2 Fire exceeds $20 million.\par \par \uc2 ''We know it was man-caused, and it probably started in a campfire,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''Do we have a suspect? No. And we can't say it was an immigrant either.''\par \par \uc2 But some are saying just that.\par \par \uc2 ''Who set the fire?'' asked Ed Ashurst, an area rancher who is convinced that he knows. ''It's obvious. There's a few people in America who don't think man walked on the moon in 1969. To say that illegal aliens didn't set the fire is like saying that Neil Armstrong didn't walk on the moon.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ashurst acknowledges that his case is circumstantial. ''Did anyone see the aliens drop a match or a cigarette? No. But we all know who started this. Who else would be up there?''\par \par \uc2 The Coronado National Forest, despite its thick forest cover and high altitudes, is in fact a major smuggling route for both drugs and migrants. Firefighters say they have even encountered illegal immigrants crossing the area as it is burning. Border Patrol officers continue to patrol there, using all-terrain vehicles and stopping cars in search of smugglers.\par \par \uc2 But none of that proves who ignited the fire.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Edwards, the ranger, cited four other southern Arizona fires, all of them in known smuggling areas, that were found to have been caused by American citizens. One was caused by a rancher whose welding created a spark that ignited the dry underbrush, he said. Another was found to have been caused by target shooters. In two cases, he said, military aircraft engaged in training exercises set off fires.\par \par \uc2 ''The automatic assumption is that it was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ,'' Mr. Edwards said, acknowledging that migrants have been found to have caused wildfires by setting campfires to stay warm.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the Coronado National Forest was singed by a fire, called Horseshoe 1, that began just north of the spot where the current fire started. It, too, was deemed as caused by humans but no suspect was ever found. Some residents, though, are sure they know who set it.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: A wildfire has burned 70,000 acres in Arizona in the past month.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc42}{\*\bkmkend toc42}\b \uc2 Former Police Chief Is Sentenced for Cover-Up in Mexican's Death\b0\par\par\uc2 By SABRINA TAVERNISE   \par \uc2 505 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 June 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A former Pennsylvania police chief who was convicted of impeding a federal investigation into the beating death of a Mexican immigrant was sentenced to 13 months in prison on Wednesday, a lower-than-expected term in a case that had become a cause celebre for Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 Judge A. Richard Caputo of Federal District Court in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., said the sentencing guidelines were too harsh for Matthew Nestor, the former police chief in Shenandoah, Pa., according to Mr. Nestor's lawyer, Joseph Nahas. A presentencing report by probation officials had recommended 57 to 71 months.\par \par \uc2 Another officer, William Moyer, a lieutenant who was convicted of lying to federal investigators, was sentenced to three months, said his lawyer, Enid Harris.\par \par \uc2 The men were accused of helping a group of white teenage football players cover up their roles in the death of Luis Ramirez, 25, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was fatally beaten in 2008 in Shenandoah.\par \par \uc2 In January, a jury acquitted the officers of the most serious charges, but convicted them of obstructing the investigation and lying to investigators. Both men have said they will appeal.\par \par \uc2 ''The sentencing was extremely fair,'' Mr. Nahas said by telephone, referring to that of his client, Mr. Nestor. ''But on the other hand, he's innocent, so one day is too much.''\par \par \uc2 Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, which prosecuted the case, said in a statement that the officers ''chose to obstruct the very investigation they were charged with conducting.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Nahas argued that his client had a good chance of winning on appeal. Prosecutors accused Mr. Nestor of misdirecting the federal investigation into Mr. Ramirez's death by omitting the names of the suspects from a police report and by failing to mention that shortly after the attack, he had spoken on the phone with Tamara Piekarsky, the mother of one of the two young men convicted in the assault.\par \par \uc2 ''How did those two omissions obstruct a federal investigation?'' Mr. Nahas said. ''It was not material.''\par \par \uc2 The two men convicted of a hate crime by a federal jury in October -- Derrick Donchak and Brandon Piekarsky -- were each sentenced this year to nine years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Their lawyers argued that the federal trial amounted to double jeopardy -- being tried twice for the same crime -- because they had already been acquitted of the most serious charges in a trial in state court in 2009. They are also appealing.\par \par \uc2 Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, a Latino rights group, called the sentence ''disappointing,'' but said the fact that the officers had been convicted and sentenced at all showed that ''we're on the path to justice having been done.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Former chief Matthew Nestor got a 13-month prison term.; William Moyer, a lieutenant, got a three-month sentence.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TUCSON -- Obama administration officials are sharpening their crackdown on the hiring of illegal immigrants by focusing increasingly tough criminal charges on employers while moving away from criminal arrests of the workers themselves.\par \par \uc2 After months of criticism from Republicans who said President Obama was relaxing immigration enforcement in workplaces, the scope of the administration's strategy has become clear as long-running investigations of employers have culminated in indictments, convictions, exponentially increased fines and jail sentences. While conducting fewer headline-making factory raids, the immigration authorities have greatly expanded the number of businesses facing scrutiny and the cases where employers face severe sanctions.\par \par \uc2 In a break with Bush-era policies, the number of criminal cases against unauthorized immigrant workers has dropped sharply over the last two years.\par \par \uc2 Among the employers who have felt the impact of the administration's tactics are two owners of Mexican restaurants in the Chuy's Mesquite Broiler chain, which are popular for their laid-back Margaritaville mood and their broiled mahi tacos. On April 20, immigration agents descended on 14 Chuy's restaurants in coordinated raids in Arizona and California, detaining kitchen workers and carrying away boxes of payroll books and other evidence.\par \par \uc2 But at the arraignment days later in federal court here, no immigrant workers stood before the judge. The only criminal defendants were the owners, Mark Evenson and his son Christopher, and an accountant who worked with them, Diane Ingrid Strehlow. If the Evensons are convicted on all charges against them of tax fraud and harboring illegal workers, they each could face more than 80 years in jail.\par \par \uc2 Of 42 illegal immigrants caught in the Chuy's sweep, only one was charged with a crime, and it was not related to the raid. Thirteen workers were processed for immigration violations -- which are civil offenses -- and detained or deported. The others remained in this country as witnesses or to seek legal status through the immigration courts.\par \par \uc2 Under President George W. Bush, immigration agents frequently conducted high-profile factory raids, leading away scores of unauthorized workers in handcuffs, often to face jail time for document fraud or identity theft before being deported. After a raid in Postville, Iowa, in 2008, nearly 300 immigrant workers went to federal prison.\par \par \uc2 The Chuy's prosecution contrasted with the application by state and county authorities of a law that Arizona adopted in 2007 to punish employers who hire illegal immigrants; the measure was upheld by the Supreme Court on Thursday. Despite the political furor over that law, only a handful of cases have been brought against employers under its terms, which provide mainly for civil penalties. But state authorities have continued to bring criminal cases against \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers, leading to their deportations.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration's record on workplace enforcement has been fiercely debated in Washington since President Obama announced that he would try, against steep odds, to pass an immigration overhaul this year. Administration officials say that their audits and investigations of employers have laid the groundwork for a system that would dissuade companies from hiring illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ''We have steadily increased our efforts to investigate and prosecute employers who violate the law on a serious and grand scale,'' said John Morton, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE. The next step, administration officials said, is to open a pathway that would allow millions of illegal immigrants in the country to live and work here legally.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, pointing to the decline in arrests of unauthorized workers, say the administration is failing to remove those immigrants from the work force just when Americans are grappling with high rates of unemployment.\par \par \uc2 ''While President Bush's so-called get-tough strategy clearly did not do enough to remove illegal workers, President Obama's strategy is much worse,'' said Representative Elton Gallegly, Republican of California, who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's immigration subcommittee.\par \par \uc2 Secretary Janet Napolitano of the Homeland Security Department halted the flashier raids in 2009. Until this year, ICE's leading tactic was ''silent raids,'' audits of companies' hiring documents. If immigration inspectors found irregularities suggesting that immigrant workers' identity documents might be false, managers had to dismiss the workers or risk prosecution.\par \par \uc2 Last year, according to government figures, the enforcement agency started 2,746 workplace investigations in addition to the audits, more than double the number in 2008, the last full year of the Bush administration. Fines totaling about $43 million, also a record, were levied on companies in immigration cases.\par \par \uc2 Department of Homeland Security officials, speaking anonymously in order to discuss internal policy, said immigration officers were no longer authorized to carry out workplace raids unless they cooperated with federal prosecutors to prepare criminal cases against the employers. Last year, 119 employers were convicted.\par \par \uc2 In March, Rick M. Vartanian, the president of a furniture company in California, was sentenced to 10 months in prison for hiring illegal immigrants. A federal investigation is also under way into hiring practices at the Chipotle chain of Mexican fast-food restaurants.\par \par \uc2 Dennis K. Burke, the United States attorney for Arizona, who led the Chuy's prosecutions, called them a ''game changer'' for the state. During a lengthy inquiry, investigators, including undercover operatives, discovered that the Evensons were keeping two sets of books: one for waiters and cashiers, Mr. Burke said, and another for Mexican kitchen workers.\par \par \uc2 According to the indictment, a customer complained to Mark Evenson that he was employing illegal immigrants. ''I need to hide you in the kitchen,'' Mr. Evenson is said to have told one Hispanic employee he knew to be undocumented.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Burke said prosecutors saw that they could accuse the Evensons under the severe penalties of the tax code -- ''the hammer,'' as he put it. Charged with evading more than $400,000 in taxes on wages for some 360 unauthorized immigrant workers, the Evensons together face more than $10 million in fines if convicted on all counts. They have pleaded not guilty, and their lawyers declined to comment, saying they awaited evidence from prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 Unusually, even immigration lawyers who represented Chuy's workers spoke favorably of the federal handling of the case.\par \par \uc2 ''ICE was nice,'' said Delia Salvatierra, a lawyer in Phoenix who represents two workers who were in the process of gaining legal status when they were detained. ''It was as benign as it can get,'' she said. Officers released the two workers so they could pursue their cases in immigration court.\par \par \uc2 The two of them, who are brothers, said they came to the United States from Mexico in the 1990s. Both had worked most of the time since in Chuy's restaurants. The eldest, Alejandro Diaz Ojeda, 36, learned to cook the Chuy's menu. Then he taught his brother, Javier, who is 30.\par \par \uc2 The brothers said they had been treated well. ''I became very fond of the company,'' Javier said.\par \par \uc2 Their experience, however, suggests how the Evensons kept their menu prices famously low. The brothers said they were paid an hourly wage -- Javier made $9.50 after 14 years -- by payroll check for the first 40 hours a week. Any overtime was paid with a different check, with no taxes deducted and no higher rate, they said. Both brothers said they often worked 70 hours a week.\par \par \uc2 The severe charges against the Evensons registered broadly with Arizona executives, business leaders here in Tucson said. But they said the case was mainly a cautionary lesson for managers who knowingly hire unauthorized immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ''If companies are paying workers under the table,'' said Glenn Hamer, president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, ''we encourage the federal government to throw the book at them.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Above, a raid on a branch of Chuy's Mesquite Broiler in Phoenix.

They also hammered out political maps for everything except, notably, the state's Congressional delegation.\par \par \uc2 During the last 20 weeks, they made some expected stops on issues like abortion, voter ID, and immigration, and some unexpected ones for shooting hogs from helicopters, regulating puppy mills and making it legal to pull catfish out of the water with your bare hands, a feat known as noodling.\par \par \uc2 Here's a rundown on some of the key issues.\par \par \uc2 Budget\par \par \uc2 It's hard to write a budget when the state is short of money and lawmakers insist up front that they will stay out of the state's savings account and not raise taxes.\par \par \uc2 They did it, but only by cutting a record $15.2 billion from current spending, including a $4 billion reduction in what public education would get under current law, and setting aside $4.8 billion in expected Medicaid spending in hopes that the federal laws or the economy will change before they have to spend that money in 2013.\par \par \uc2 The budget process limped to the end of the session -- with lawmakers approving the budget on Saturday -- dependent on related legislation pulling $3.2 billion from the state's Rainy Day Fund so the state wouldn't default on bills for the current budget, but using none of it to help close the huge shortfall for 2012-13. That balancing act required some money from a combination of deferred payments and accelerated tax collections and other tricks, cuts to programs throughout state government, and rosy forecasts that lower the price tags on programs where costs are rising with the state population, inflation and participation rates.\par \par \uc2 As local school districts write their own budgets and decide their tax rates for the coming school year, state lawmakers will learn how their public education cuts and new formulas for state aid to local schools translate back home. And they will face re-election -- in new political maps -- on the basis of the reactions to those and other provisions of the two-year spending plan.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Representative Jim Pitts, Republican of Waxahachie and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee; Senator Steve Ogden, Republican of Bryan and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; Gov. Rick Perry; Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst; and Speaker Joe Straus.\par \par \uc2 -- ROSS RAMSEY\par \par \uc2 Immigration\par \par \uc2 It was supposed to be the session of birther bills, criminalizing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 's presence in the state (as opposed to being only a federal civil violation), limiting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 's access to courts, mandating electronic employment verification and even stripping babies born in Texas to illegal immigrants of their birthright citizenship. But the 82nd Legislature, as a whole, did not have the stomach for the most draconian proposals.\par \par \uc2 Even the so-called ''sanctuary cities'' legislation, which some called ''Arizona lite,'' failed to make much headway. (It would have prohibited communities from adopting policies that would prevent law enforcement officers from inquiring about the immigration status of people detained or arrested.) It did not pass the Senate after Democrats, 12 in all, voted against bringing up the bill for a floor debate.\par \par \uc2 Some immigration measures are on their way to the governor's desk, including a bill that would allow counties to adopt stricter rules for legal immigrants who apply for indigent health care. And it is possible that some of the tougher proposals may yet be resurrected in the final hours of the session.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Representative Burt R. Solomons, Republican of Carrollton, who got the sanctuary cities bill out of the House, and Senator Thomas D. Williams, Republican of The Woodlands, who sponsored the bill in the Senate but did not try to circumvent the two-thirds rule when Democrats stopped it from coming to the floor for debate.\par \par \uc2 -- JULIAN AGUILAR\par \par \uc2 Redistricting\par \par \uc2 Texas Republicans couldn't have timed their huge victories in November any better, increasing their numbers in the State Legislature and the Congressional delegation just before it came time to institutionalize those results with new redistricting maps. Lawmakers drew maps for the State Board of Education, for the State Senate and for the State House, but not for Congressional districts.\par \par \uc2 The Senate map is a classic incumbent-protection plan, with only one of the 31 senators -- Wendy Davis, Democrat of Fort Worth -- in a hostile new district, which will be vulnerable to a court challenge because it splits minorities in a way that opponents say violates the federal Voting Rights Act. As for the House, the new map puts 90 to 93 incumbents in districts where Republicans ordinarily beat Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Unless there's a special session with cartography on the agenda, the Congressional maps will be drawn by the federal courts. Texas gets four new seats as a result of its growth over the last decade. Republicans have a claim on at least two. But 89 percent of the state's growth was in minority populations, giving rise to counterclaims for those new seats.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Representative Burt R. Solomons, Republican of Carrollton, and Senator Kel Seliger, Republican of Amarillo, the chairmen, respectively, of the House and Senate redistricting committees.\par \par \uc2 -- ROSS RAMSEY\par \par \uc2 Public Education\par \par \uc2 The legislative session brought public schools one drastic change -- $4 billion less in state financing -- but not much else.\par \par \uc2 Many lawmakers entered the session with hopes that the spartan budget could propel reform in school finance and education policy. But even legislation billed as a method to help school districts cope with the deep cuts stalled. Measures that singled out often-criticized ''unfunded mandates'' -- state regulations on class size, furloughs and layoffs championed by education leaders in both chambers but fiercely opposed by teachers associations -- died one after another.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers did succeed in passing a bill that expands the definition of bullying, an issue that has drawn much public attention after a spate of bullying-related suicides. But they declined to include any mention of bullying related to sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation -- the cause of some of the recent suicides. H.B. 1942 from Representative Diane Patrick, Republican of Arlington, does add cyberbullying to the books, however, and gives school districts more flexibility in how they address aggressive behavior in the classroom.\par \par \uc2 As of Saturday morning, chief negotiators from both chambers had reached agreement on school financing formulas. The plan, which awaits approval from the full Legislature, avoids any extensive policy overhaul, leaving that for lawmakers to study over the interim and take up during the 83rd Legislature.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYER State teachers associations. They lost the financing battle, but flexed their muscles and defeated a score of measures -- the final body count will likely include charter schools and teacher evaluation bills -- initially popular with the Republican majority.\par \par \uc2 -- MORGAN SMITH\par \par \uc2 Higher Education\par \par \uc2 Members of the state's higher education community grappled with how to raise productivity -- higher graduation rates, more efficiency in teaching -- while cutting their budgets as a result of reductions in state financing.\par \par \uc2 The cuts, though not quite as deep as originally proposed, still sting. A 25 percent reduction in money for special items not contained within basic financing formulas hit the state's smaller universities particularly hard. Lawmakers tried to provide relief by eliminating some unfunded mandates.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, they approved the development of a financing system for colleges and universities that rewards outcomes like higher graduation rates. They also consented to giving high-achieving students priority access to the state's primary need-based grant program, which will be available to nearly 29,000 fewer would-be students in the next two years.\par \par \uc2 But the real excitement occurred outside the legislative chambers. Actions by the chairman of the University of Texas System Board of Regents, Gene Powell, unexpectedly provoked an intense statewide examination into the behind-the-scenes influence of a small group of individuals -- Gov. Rick Perry and his allies at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative research organization, who have pushed the state's public university systems to embrace a set of proposals that they say would increase transparency, efficiency and accountability.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the proposals say they are anti-intellectual and would be especially damaging to the state's flagship institutions. The controversy prompted the formation of a new Joint Oversight Committee on Higher Education Governance, Excellence and Transparency led by Representative Dan Branch, Republican of Dallas, and Senator Judith Zaffirini, Democrat of Laredo.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Jeff Sandefer, an Austin businessman, Perry donor and Texas Public Policy Foundation board member, who wrote the so-called ''breakthrough solutions.''\par \par \uc2 -- REEVE HAMILTON\par \par \uc2 Criminal Justice\par \par \uc2 For the first time, Texas will shutter a maximum-security prison unit. Lawmakers decided to close the Central Unit in Sugar Land, a Houston suburb. For years, city leaders had asked for the facility to be closed, and the state's multibillion-dollar budget hole made that wish come true. Lawmakers estimate that the closing will save the state $50 million over two years.\par \par \uc2 A new agency, the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, will take on the duties of the Texas Youth Commission and the Texas Juvenile Probation Commission, which will be eliminated (and three youth detention facilities could be closed). The goal, lawmakers said, is to keep young offenders closer to their homes and rehabilitation services in urban areas. Combining the agencies should save about $150 million.\par \par \uc2 The Windham School District, which provides education for the state's 150,000 prisoners, unexpectedly came under attack. Lawmakers said there was not enough accountability in the program and questioned whether inmates could take online classes instead. They threatened to eliminate the school district, but it survived, although its budget was slashed.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for the rights of people accused of crimes made significant headway with measures that will reform how the police make use of eyewitness identification and expand prisoners' access to postconviction DNA testing. The Legislature also passed a bill to ensure that those who were wrongfully convicted are compensated for their time behind bars.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYER Senator Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston and chairman of the Innocence Project, saw to the passage of bills intended to stop and to correct wrongful convictions.\par \par \uc2 -- BRANDI GRISSOM\par \par \uc2 Health and Human Services\par \par \uc2 The big story was the budget -- and the Medicaid rate cuts inflicted on the hospitals, doctors and providers who treat Texas' neediest patients. Other health-efficiency legislation sharply altered how hospitals are financed, expanded managed care and authorized pay-for-performance pilot programs for medical providers.\par \par \uc2 But the political drama surrounding abortion and money for family planning programs threatened to overshadow all of it. After passing legislation requiring women who are seeking abortions to get a sonogram and to hear a description of the fetus 24 hours before the procedure, Republican lawmakers removed tens of millions of dollars in financing for contraception and reproductive health screenings for low-income women. (On Friday, the Medicaid Women's Health Program, which gets $9 in federal money for every $1 the state spends, had been quietly revived in the state budget.)\par \par \uc2 As with similar efforts in Washington and in other states, the Republicans' goal was to put Planned Parenthood -- which provides abortions in some of its clinics, but none of the ones that receive state dollars -- out of business.\par \par \uc2 By Saturday morning, bills banning or curbing the carrying out of the new federal health care overhaul were dead or dying. But a measure to ask Washington for control of Medicaid and Medicare had new life.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Representative Lois W. Kolkhorst, Republican of Brenham, pushed for state sovereignty in health care, while Representative John M. Zerwas, Republican of Simonton, an anesthesiologist, served as her more moderate foil. In the Senate, Jane Nelson, Republican of Flower Mound, shepherded Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst's health overhaul plan, while Senator Robert Deuell, Republican of Greenville and a family physician, kept Planned Parenthood in his cross hairs.\par \par \uc2 -- EMILY RAMSHAW\par \par \uc2 Energy\par \par \uc2 ''Landmark'' is how politicians are describing legislation that will require disclosure of the chemicals used in the drilling practice known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The legislation, which has passed both houses, will mandate well-by-well disclosures on a public Web site, and oils and gas drillers say it could serve as a model for other states, although environmentalists remain concerned about provisions that allow companies to exclude ''trade secrets'' from disclosure.\par \par \uc2 A bill that would make changes to the oil and gas industry's regulator appeared dead on Saturday. Lawmakers had sought to change the name of the Railroad Commission to the more accurate \uc2 Texas Oil and Gas\uc2  Commission and also alter its structure.\par \par \uc2 On water, lawmakers passed legislation to clarify that landowners have a ''real property right'' to Texas groundwater.\par \par \uc2 They also approved expansion of a planned radioactive-waste dump in West Texas and handed significant rate-setting authority for some waste to the site's operator, Waste Energy Specialists, a company majority-owned by Harold Simmons, a Dallas billionaire, and his family.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYER Representative James L. Keffer, Republican of Eastland, who pushed for the fracking legislation.\par \par \uc2 -- KATE GALBRAITH\par \par \uc2 Surprises\par \par \uc2 It's the Texas Legislature: Expect the unexpected. Among the biggest head-scratchers? In the face of the largest budget shortfall in state history, lawmakers left billions of dollars in the Rainy Day Fund. In the end, it was a school finance meltdown that jeopardized lawmakers' summer plans by threatening a special legislative session. And, despite entering the 2011 session with a supermajority in the House, Republican lawmakers still struggled to get some key measures through.\par \par \uc2 A lockup over windstorm insurance -- pitting Gov. Rick Perry against trial lawyers who have spent millions against him -- came down to the wire, creating another threat of legislative overtime. Other surprises include Republican lawmakers' determination to gut contraception and family planning (anything connected to Planned Parenthood) though budget experts believe such efforts will cost the state money in additional Medicaid births and loss of federal dollars. And the higher education ''research vs. classroom'' sideshow saw key lawmakers tangle with the University of Texas System Board of Regents and Mr. Perry.\par \par \uc2 Nothing's dead until Monday. But in the waning hours of the session, efforts to allow concealed handguns on college campuses and to ban so-called ''sanctuary cities'' for illegal immigrants appeared to be fizzling.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Gov. Rick Perry: This session, when the governor set an agenda, lawmakers took note; on Saturday morning they were well on their way to passing all but one of his emergency items. And they followed his budget wishes -- balancing the shortfall without the Rainy Day Fund -- even in the face of pressure from financially beset schools and angry parents and health care providers.\par \par \uc2 Representative David Simpson, Republican of Longview: The freshman engaged in quixotic battles, opposing bills regulating puppy mills and banning ''salvia'' and got crosswise with the federal government over his bill to criminalize ''groping'' by airport security agents.\par \par \uc2 -- EMILY RAMSHAW and BRANDI GRISSOM\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: As legislators argued points on bills, plotted strategy and voted on measures, other Texans took their concerns to the streets of Austin. Among the demonstrations during the regular session of the 82nd Legislature were ones against abortion and proposed cuts in spending on education.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 The 82nd Texas Legislature's regular session ends as it started, with lawmakers arguing about a shrunken state budget and redistricting.\par \par \uc2 With Republicans operating with a supermajority in the House and a commanding majority in the Senate, there was little doubt that the G.O.P. would be able to impose its will.\par \par \uc2 What was new was the power exerted by the Tea Party movement, which helped propel dozens of new lawmakers into the Capitol to hold the line on solving the budget mess without raising significant new revenue or tapping the state's sizable Rainy Day Fund.\par \par \uc2 As a result, legislators have made serious cuts to education, health and human services, and other state programs that will be felt over the next two years. They also hammered out political maps for everything except, notably, the state's Congressional delegation.\par \par \uc2 During the last 20 weeks, they made some expected stops on issues like abortion, voter ID, and immigration, and some unexpected ones for shooting hogs from helicopters, regulating puppy mills and making it legal to pull catfish out of the water with your bare hands, a feat known as noodling.\par \par \uc2 Here's a rundown on some of the key issues.\par \par \uc2 Budget\par \par \uc2 It's hard to write a budget when the state is short of money and lawmakers insist up front that they will stay out of the state's savings account and not raise taxes.\par \par \uc2 They did it, but only by cutting a record $15.2 billion from current spending, including a $4 billion reduction in what public education would get under current law, and setting aside $4.8 billion in expected Medicaid spending in hopes that the federal laws or the economy will change before they have to spend that money in 2013.\par \par \uc2 The budget process limped to the end of the session -- with lawmakers approving the budget on Saturday -- dependent on related legislation pulling $3.2 billion from the state's Rainy Day Fund so the state wouldn't default on bills for the current budget, but using none of it to help close the huge shortfall for 2012-13. That balancing act required some money from a combination of deferred payments and accelerated tax collections and other tricks, cuts to programs throughout state government, and rosy forecasts that lower the price tags on programs where costs are rising with the state population, inflation and participation rates.\par \par \uc2 As local school districts write their own budgets and decide their tax rates for the coming school year, state lawmakers will learn how their public education cuts and new formulas for state aid to local schools translate back home. And they will face re-election -- in new political maps -- on the basis of the reactions to those and other provisions of the two-year spending plan.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Representative Jim Pitts, Republican of Waxahachie and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee; Senator Steve Ogden, Republican of Bryan and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; Gov. Rick Perry; Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst; and Speaker Joe Straus.\par \par \uc2 -- ROSS RAMSEY\par \par \uc2 Immigration\par \par \uc2 It was supposed to be the session of birther bills, criminalizing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 's presence in the state (as opposed to being only a federal civil violation), limiting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 's access to courts, mandating electronic employment verification and even stripping babies born in Texas to illegal immigrants of their birthright citizenship. But the 82nd Legislature, as a whole, did not have the stomach for the most draconian proposals.\par \par \uc2 Even the so-called ''sanctuary cities'' legislation, which some called ''Arizona lite,'' failed to make much headway. (It would have prohibited communities from adopting policies that would prevent law enforcement officers from inquiring about the immigration status of people detained or arrested.) It did not pass the Senate after Democrats, 12 in all, voted against bringing up the bill for a floor debate.\par \par \uc2 Some immigration measures are on their way to the governor's desk, including a bill that would allow counties to adopt stricter rules for legal immigrants who apply for indigent health care. And it is possible that some of the tougher proposals may yet be resurrected in the final hours of the session.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Representative Burt R. Solomons, Republican of Carrollton, who got the sanctuary cities bill out of the House, and Senator Thomas D. Williams, Republican of The Woodlands, who sponsored the bill in the Senate but did not try to circumvent the two-thirds rule when Democrats stopped it from coming to the floor for debate.\par \par \uc2 -- JULIAN AGUILAR\par \par \uc2 Redistricting\par \par \uc2 Texas Republicans couldn't have timed their huge victories in November any better, increasing their numbers in the State Legislature and the Congressional delegation just before it came time to institutionalize those results with new redistricting maps. Lawmakers drew maps for the State Board of Education, for the State Senate and for the State House, but not for Congressional districts.\par \par \uc2 The Senate map is a classic incumbent-protection plan, with only one of the 31 senators -- Wendy Davis, Democrat of Fort Worth -- in a hostile new district, which will be vulnerable to a court challenge because it splits minorities in a way that opponents say violates the federal Voting Rights Act. As for the House, the new map puts 90 to 93 incumbents in districts where Republicans ordinarily beat Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Unless there's a special session with cartography on the agenda, the Congressional maps will be drawn by the federal courts. Texas gets four new seats as a result of its growth over the last decade. Republicans have a claim on at least two. But 89 percent of the state's growth was in minority populations, giving rise to counterclaims for those new seats.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Representative Burt R. Solomons, Republican of Carrollton, and Senator Kel Seliger, Republican of Amarillo, the chairmen, respectively, of the House and Senate redistricting committees.\par \par \uc2 -- ROSS RAMSEY\par \par \uc2 Public Education\par \par \uc2 The legislative session brought public schools one drastic change -- $4 billion less in state financing -- but not much else.\par \par \uc2 Many lawmakers entered the session with hopes that the spartan budget could propel reform in school finance and education policy. But even legislation billed as a method to help school districts cope with the deep cuts stalled. Measures that singled out often-criticized ''unfunded mandates'' -- state regulations on class size, furloughs and layoffs championed by education leaders in both chambers but fiercely opposed by teachers associations -- died one after another.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers did succeed in passing a bill that expands the definition of bullying, an issue that has drawn much public attention after a spate of bullying-related suicides. But they declined to include any mention of bullying related to sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation -- the cause of some of the recent suicides. H.B. 1942 from Representative Diane Patrick, Republican of Arlington, does add cyberbullying to the books, however, and gives school districts more flexibility in how they address aggressive behavior in the classroom.\par \par \uc2 As of Saturday morning, chief negotiators from both chambers had reached agreement on school financing formulas. The plan, which awaits approval from the full Legislature, avoids any extensive policy overhaul, leaving that for lawmakers to study over the interim and take up during the 83rd Legislature.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYER State teachers associations. They lost the financing battle, but flexed their muscles and defeated a score of measures -- the final body count will likely include charter schools and teacher evaluation bills -- initially popular with the Republican majority.\par \par \uc2 -- MORGAN SMITH\par \par \uc2 Higher Education\par \par \uc2 Members of the state's higher education community grappled with how to raise productivity -- higher graduation rates, more efficiency in teaching -- while cutting their budgets as a result of reductions in state financing.\par \par \uc2 The cuts, though not quite as deep as originally proposed, still sting. A 25 percent reduction in money for special items not contained within basic financing formulas hit the state's smaller universities particularly hard. Lawmakers tried to provide relief by eliminating some unfunded mandates.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, they approved the development of a financing system for colleges and universities that rewards outcomes like higher graduation rates. They also consented to giving high-achieving students priority access to the state's primary need-based grant program, which will be available to nearly 29,000 fewer would-be students in the next two years.\par \par \uc2 But the real excitement occurred outside the legislative chambers. Actions by the chairman of the University of Texas System Board of Regents, Gene Powell, unexpectedly provoked an intense statewide examination into the behind-the-scenes influence of a small group of individuals -- Gov. Rick Perry and his allies at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative research organization, who have pushed the state's public university systems to embrace a set of proposals that they say would increase transparency, efficiency and accountability.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the proposals say they are anti-intellectual and would be especially damaging to the state's flagship institutions. The controversy prompted the formation of a new Joint Oversight Committee on Higher Education Governance, Excellence and Transparency led by Representative Dan Branch, Republican of Dallas, and Senator Judith Zaffirini, Democrat of Laredo.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Jeff Sandefer, an Austin businessman, Perry donor and Texas Public Policy Foundation board member, who wrote the so-called ''breakthrough solutions.''\par \par \uc2 -- REEVE HAMILTON\par \par \uc2 Criminal Justice\par \par \uc2 For the first time, Texas will shutter a maximum-security prison unit. Lawmakers decided to close the Central Unit in Sugar Land, a Houston suburb. For years, city leaders had asked for the facility to be closed, and the state's multibillion-dollar budget hole made that wish come true. Lawmakers estimate that the closing will save the state $50 million over two years.\par \par \uc2 A new agency, the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, will take on the duties of the Texas Youth Commission and the Texas Juvenile Probation Commission, which will be eliminated (and three youth detention facilities could be closed). The goal, lawmakers said, is to keep young offenders closer to their homes and rehabilitation services in urban areas. Combining the agencies should save about $150 million.\par \par \uc2 The Windham School District, which provides education for the state's 150,000 prisoners, unexpectedly came under attack. Lawmakers said there was not enough accountability in the program and questioned whether inmates could take online classes instead. They threatened to eliminate the school district, but it survived, although its budget was slashed.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for the rights of people accused of crimes made significant headway with measures that will reform how the police make use of eyewitness identification and expand prisoners' access to postconviction DNA testing. The Legislature also passed a bill to ensure that those who were wrongfully convicted are compensated for their time behind bars.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYER Senator Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston and chairman of the Innocence Project, saw to the passage of bills intended to stop and to correct wrongful convictions.\par \par \uc2 -- BRANDI GRISSOM\par \par \uc2 Health and Human Services\par \par \uc2 The big story was the budget -- and the Medicaid rate cuts inflicted on the hospitals, doctors and providers who treat Texas' neediest patients. Other health-efficiency legislation sharply altered how hospitals are financed, expanded managed care and authorized pay-for-performance pilot programs for medical providers.\par \par \uc2 But the political drama surrounding abortion and money for family planning programs threatened to overshadow all of it. After passing legislation requiring women who are seeking abortions to get a sonogram and to hear a description of the fetus 24 hours before the procedure, Republican lawmakers removed tens of millions of dollars in financing for contraception and reproductive health screenings for low-income women. (On Friday, the Medicaid Women's Health Program, which gets $9 in federal money for every $1 the state spends, had been quietly revived in the state budget.)\par \par \uc2 As with similar efforts in Washington and in other states, the Republicans' goal was to put Planned Parenthood -- which provides abortions in some of its clinics, but none of the ones that receive state dollars -- out of business.\par \par \uc2 By Saturday morning, bills banning or curbing the carrying out of the new federal health care overhaul were dead or dying. But a measure to ask Washington for control of Medicaid and Medicare had new life.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Representative Lois W. Kolkhorst, Republican of Brenham, pushed for state sovereignty in health care, while Representative John M. Zerwas, Republican of Simonton, an anesthesiologist, served as her more moderate foil. In the Senate, Jane Nelson, Republican of Flower Mound, shepherded Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst's health overhaul plan, while Senator Robert Deuell, Republican of Greenville and a family physician, kept Planned Parenthood in his cross hairs.\par \par \uc2 -- EMILY RAMSHAW\par \par \uc2 Energy\par \par \uc2 ''Landmark'' is how politicians are describing legislation that will require disclosure of the chemicals used in the drilling practice known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The legislation, which has passed both houses, will mandate well-by-well disclosures on a public Web site, and oils and gas drillers say it could serve as a model for other states, although environmentalists remain concerned about provisions that allow companies to exclude ''trade secrets'' from disclosure.\par \par \uc2 A bill that would make changes to the oil and gas industry's regulator appeared dead on Saturday. Lawmakers had sought to change the name of the Railroad Commission to the more accurate \uc2 Texas Oil and Gas\uc2  Commission and also alter its structure.\par \par \uc2 On water, lawmakers passed legislation to clarify that landowners have a ''real property right'' to Texas groundwater.\par \par \uc2 They also approved expansion of a planned radioactive-waste dump in West Texas and handed significant rate-setting authority for some waste to the site's operator, Waste Control Specialists, a company majority-owned by Harold Simmons, a Dallas billionaire, and his family.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYER Representative James L. Keffer, Republican of Eastland, who pushed for the fracking legislation.\par \par \uc2 -- KATE GALBRAITH\par \par \uc2 Surprises\par \par \uc2 It's the Texas Legislature: Expect the unexpected. Among the biggest head-scratchers? In the face of the largest budget shortfall in state history, lawmakers left billions of dollars in the Rainy Day Fund. In the end, it was a school finance meltdown that jeopardized lawmakers' summer plans by threatening a special legislative session. And, despite entering the 2011 session with a supermajority in the House, Republican lawmakers still struggled to get some key measures through.\par \par \uc2 A lockup over windstorm insurance -- pitting Gov. Rick Perry against trial lawyers who have spent millions against him -- came down to the wire, creating another threat of legislative overtime. Other surprises include Republican lawmakers' determination to gut contraception and family planning (anything connected to Planned Parenthood) though budget experts believe such efforts will cost the state money in additional Medicaid births and loss of federal dollars. And the higher education ''research vs. classroom'' sideshow saw key lawmakers tangle with the University of Texas System Board of Regents and Mr. Perry.\par \par \uc2 Nothing's dead until Monday. But in the waning hours of the session, efforts to allow concealed handguns on college campuses and to ban so-called ''sanctuary cities'' for illegal immigrants appeared to be fizzling.\par \par \uc2 KEY PLAYERS Gov. Rick Perry: This session, when the governor set an agenda, lawmakers took note; on Saturday morning they were well on their way to passing all but one of his emergency items. And they followed his budget wishes -- balancing the shortfall without the Rainy Day Fund -- even in the face of pressure from financially beset schools and angry parents and health care providers.\par \par \uc2 Representative David Simpson, Republican of Longview: The freshman engaged in quixotic battles, opposing bills regulating puppy mills and banning ''salvia'' and got crosswise with the federal government over his bill to criminalize ''groping'' by airport security agents.\par \par \uc2 -- EMILY RAMSHAW and BRANDI GRISSOM\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Correction: June 5, 2011, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of an article assessing the Texas legislative session had an incorrect name for the operator of a planned radioactive-waste dump in West Texas. It is Waste Control Specialists, not Waste Energy Specialists.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: As legislators argued points on bills, plotted strategy and voted on measures, other Texans took their concerns to the streets of Austin. Among the demonstrations during the regular session of the 82nd Legislature were ones against abortion and proposed cuts in spending on education.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The decision by the Supreme Court this week upholding an Arizona law punishing employers for hiring illegal immigrants was an energy boost for state lawmakers across the country who have proposed bills this year to curb illegal immigration. As if they needed it.\par \par \uc2 According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, state lawmakers set a new record in the first three months of the year, proposing 1,538 bills related to immigration, with 141 measures in 26 states passed into law. While some of those laws extended new opportunities to illegal immigrants, like permitting them to pay lower in-state tuition rates at public colleges, most of the laws imposed restrictions on them.\par \par \uc2 With its decision on the hiring law that Arizona passed in 2007, the Supreme Court indicated that it would not flat out disallow any action by states on immigration enforcement, even though federal law generally pre-empts state measures in that area. State lawmakers now know for certain that there is some firm legal ground for the recent round of bills that seek to drive illegal immigrants out of the country by preventing them from taking jobs and even living here.\par \par \uc2 But it remains unclear just how large the playing field is that the Supreme Court has opened. Arizona's employer law was carefully tailored to conform to specific, narrow terms in federal immigration law, and it was never suspended by any federal court. To date, only a handful of states have passed laws with requirements and penalties for employers similar to Arizona's.\par \par \uc2 Instead, this year many more states weighed whether to emulate the more sweeping and politically polarizing law that Arizona passed last year, known as S.B. 1070, which expanded the powers of the state and local police to ask about the immigration status of people they detain. The Supreme Court has not yet considered that law, which has been largely suspended by federal courts.\par \par \uc2 By now, however, with the legislative season either winding down or over in most states, it seems clear that lawmakers' decisions on whether to follow Arizona's lead on police enforcement ultimately had more to do with state politics than with concerns about potential legal challenges and Supreme Court rulings.\par \par \uc2 Kris Kobach, the constitutional lawyer who has been the intellectual if not the actual author of many of the state immigration enforcement laws, was elated by the court's recent decision. The ruling ''has vindicated our position that states are not pre-empted by federal law from these actions,'' said Mr. Kobach, who is now secretary of state of Kansas.\par \par \uc2 He predicted that many more states would soon ''jump on the bandwagon'' to impose new responsibilities on employers.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's statute includes the most severe penalties of any state hiring law, imposing what employers call a ''business death penalty'': on the second offense of knowingly hiring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , the business loses its license permanently. Arizona also mandated the use by all employers of a federal electronic program for verifying the work authorization of new hires, known as E-Verify.\par \par \uc2 Only Mississippi and South Carolina followed Arizona in requiring all employers to use the verification system. In the storm of lawmaking this year, Georgia and Utah passed laws requiring larger businesses to use the system (in Georgia, by July 2013). Virginia required employers to use it, but only for state contracts.\par \par \uc2 Far larger is the number of states where Arizona-style enforcement laws were debated, voted, praised and protested. According to the National Immigration Forum, which opposes such laws, bills like Arizona's failed after sometimes furious debate in 15 states.\par \par \uc2 Georgia was the first state to pass a law close to Arizona S.B. 1070, and Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, signed it into law this month. Georgia growers raised an outcry against the law, saying it would cripple their labor force. But Republicans who control the legislature strongly supported the law, which built on an earlier set of measures against illegal immigration Georgia passed in 2006.\par \par \uc2 In March, Utah passed an enforcement law that echoed Arizona's, but tempered it politically with a measure that would create a temporary guest worker program. A federal court has temporarily held up the enforcement law.\par \par \uc2 With their session in its last days, Alabama lawmakers are close to passing a broad measure that could be even tougher than Arizona's. In addition to requiring most employers to use the verification system, Alabama's bill would ban \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students in public schools from participating in band, cheerleading and any other extracurricular activity. The bill has faced little organized opposition.\par \par \uc2 An enforcement measure is also close to passage in South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 Several states stood down at the last minute. After intense opposition by Florida growers and the tourism industry, legislators let an enforcement measure die in the final hours of their session. On Thursday, Democrats in the Texas Senate blocked a measure that would have stepped up immigration enforcement in cities. Texas police chiefs turned out forcefully against the measure, although Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, had made it a priority.\par \par \uc2 Finally, Maryland and Connecticut, with small but rapidly growing Latino populations, went a different way entirely, passing laws to allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to attend public colleges at in-state rates.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110528e75s0003o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Eulogia was scared and adrift. At 25, she was poor, pregnant and an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . She worried about how she would pay for medical care and raise her baby, and even whether a trip to the hospital might prompt her deportation to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 But when she plunged into a postpartum depression in 2003 after the birth of her daughter, the first of three children, a hospital social worker referred her and her husband to an East Harlem social service agency that has counseled them and helped them get care for their family and get the government assistance their children were eligible for as American citizens.\par \par \uc2 ''I think I very am lucky,'' Eulogia said in an interview this week, asking that her last name not be used because she still fears deportation. She said most \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents felt tremendously isolated and did not have ''the confidence to ask for help.''\par \par \uc2 Indeed, a recently published study of the early development of children born to illegal immigrants in New York City suggests that most stories that begin like Eulogia's do not end as well.\par \par \uc2 Even though the children have citizenship and live in an immigrant-friendly city that offers them a wide array of services, many are still hobbled by serious developmental and educational deficits resulting from their parents' lives in the shadows, according to the study, whose author says it is the most comprehensive look to date at the effects of parents' immigration status on young children.\par \par \uc2 ''The undocumented are viewed in current policy debates as lawbreakers, laborers or victims -- seldom as parents raising citizen children,'' wrote the author, Hirokazu Yoshikawa, a Harvard education professor who has published the study as a book, ''Immigrants Raising Citizens'' (Russell Sage Foundation, 2011).\par \par \uc2 Professor Yoshikawa found that by the time the children of illegal immigrants reached age 2, they showed significantly lower levels of language and cognitive development than the children of legal immigrants and native-born parents.\par \par \uc2 ''Millions of the youngest citizens in the United States, simply by virtue of being born to a parent with a particular legal status, have less access to the learning opportunities that are the building blocks of adult productivity,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 The implications for the nation are potentially far-reaching and long-lasting, he said, considering that of all preschool children of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents in the United States, an estimated 91 percent -- four million children -- are American citizens.\par \par \uc2 Poor cognitive development can lead to lower school performance, which in turn can lead to higher dropout rates, an undertrained work force and lower economic productivity. ''Ignoring these children has costs for society,'' Professor Yoshikawa warned.\par \par \uc2 He and his team began their research by visiting maternity wards at public hospitals around New York in 2004 and getting permission to study nearly 400 babies newly born to Chinese, Dominican and Mexican parents, as well as to native-born African American parents. The researchers, who were affiliated with the Center for Research on Culture, Development and Education at New York University, followed the children for three years.\par \par \uc2 The researchers found that poor immigrants cannot afford learning materials or stimulating programs in child care centers. Fear of deportation or ignorance about how the city works often prevents those parents from seeking help from government agencies that provide child care subsidies or food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Many illegal immigrants, particularly those belonging to newer immigrant groups, like Mexicans in New York, have smaller extended families or less-developed social networks than others, and therefore fewer people around to help raise children.\par \par \uc2 The psychological stress suffered by illegal immigrants -- many of whom work long hours for low wages and live in crowded, poorly maintained apartments -- can be transmitted to young children, the study says.\par \par \uc2 ''Greater hardship among parents, both economic and psychological,'' Professor Yoshikawa wrote, ''can harm children's learning by lowering parents' active engagement with their children, the quantity or quality of their language or their warmth and responsiveness.''\par \par \uc2 In an interview, he pointed out that illegal immigrants' anxieties about seeking help -- and those anxieties' effects on children -- could be even worse in places with ''harsher'' immigration policies.\par \par \uc2 Eulogia, the East Harlem mother, said she was brought to the United States by her parents when she was 11 and lived in a succession of cramped apartments in New York. She helped her parents sell flowers on the street to make ends meet. Though she graduated from high school, she remained an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and imagined that her own children would live the same kind of existence.\par \par \uc2 Little Sisters of the Assumption Family Health Service -- a community-based organization in East Harlem that provides counseling and other assistance to poor people, especially immigrants -- helped Eulogia and her husband get food stamps and enroll in the federal Women, Infants and Children assistance program. Her eldest daughter, now 7, receives after-school tutoring at the center, while her second child, a 2-year-old boy, is getting speech therapy. And the family has secured better housing.\par \par \uc2 In his book, Professor Yoshikawa extols the work of groups like Family Health Service.\par \par \uc2 ''By bringing these families out of the shadows and providing them with access to better work conditions and learning opportunities,'' he wrote, ''we can ensure that the nation's most vulnerable young citizens have an equal chance to succeed in their early development, later schooling and adulthood.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Giovanna Baca, a speech-language pathologist, works with Miguel Angel Arista Juarez at Little Sisters of the Assumption Family Health Service.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The University of San Francisco will award an honorary doctorate at graduation ceremonies on Friday to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Isabel Castillo, 26, of Harrisonburg, Va., who has been a leading advocate for passage of the Dream Act. The legislation would give legal status to people like her, who were brought to the United States at a young age and went on to attend college. Ms. Castillo came to the United States from Mexico at age 6; she graduated with honors from Eastern Mennonite University. Stephen A. Privett, the president of the University of San Francisco, said he decided to award the degree after reading about Ms. Castillo in the On Education column in The New York Times earlier this year. He said the university wanted to ''underscore the fundamental unfairness of our denying a path to citizenship to some of the most motivated college students in the country.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110518e75i00090\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA -- Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia on Friday signed into law one of the nation's toughest immigration measures, empowering local police officers to question certain suspects about their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 The law is similar to measures in Arizona and Utah that have drawn legal challenges and economic boycotts. Mr. Deal, a Republican, said he would have preferred a comprehensive immigration overhaul from the federal government.\par \par \uc2 ''Illegal immigration is a complex and troublesome issue, and no state alone can fix it,'' he said. ''We will continue to have a broken system until we have a federal solution. In the meantime, states must act to defend their taxpayers.''\par \par \uc2 The law takes effect July 1. Already, civil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center, say they are considering lawsuits against Georgia. Business groups, including the state Chamber of Commerce, have raised fears that the law will diminish tourism. In Arizona and Utah, court injunctions have delayed carrying out the laws while their constitutionality is determined.\par \par \uc2 One of the Georgia law's authors, Matthew L. Ramsey, a Republican state legislator, said the measure was written to withstand legal challenges. Lawmakers set clear guidelines on when the police are allowed to request a suspect's immigration status, he said. The law allows state and local police officers to request immigration documentation from criminal suspects and, if they do not receive it, to take the suspects to jails, where federal officials could begin the deportation process.\par \par \uc2 ''States don't have the legal authority to deport. We don't have the legal authority to secure our borders,'' Mr. Ramsey said. ''But our goal is, within a constitutional framework, to eliminate incentives for illegal aliens to cross into our state.''\par \par \uc2 The law also creates stricter requirements for businesses hiring workers and harsher punishments for anyone who harbors or employs an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . There are 425,000 illegal immigrants in Georgia, the seventh most of any state, the Pew Hispanic Center estimates. Two other Southern states, Alabama and South Carolina, are also considering similar immigration bills that are expected by many experts to pass this year.\par \par \uc2 Tom Smith, a finance professor at Emory University, said Georgia businesses were bracing for the impact. Some studies suggest that that Arizona's law has cost the state as much as $250 million in convention business, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''People are looking at the history in Arizona and thinking, 'Could a law in Georgia could have the same impact?' '' Professor Smith said. ''We're waiting to see whether that will happen in Georgia now.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Gov. Nathan Deal took questions after signing the bill.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Federal officials issued a memorandum to the nation's school districts on Friday saying it was against the law for education officials to seek information that might reveal the immigration status of children applying for enrollment.\par \par \uc2 Civil liberties advocates and others have complained in recent months that many school districts are seeking children's immigration papers as a prerequisite for enrollment. Some state and local officials have also considered bills to require prospective students to reveal their citizenship or immigration status.\par \par \uc2 ''We have become aware of student enrollment practices that may chill or discourage the participation, or lead to the exclusion, of students based on their or their parents' or guardians' actual or perceived citizenship or immigration status,'' said the memo, from Justice and Education Department officials. ''These practices contravene federal law.''\par \par \uc2 The letter cited a 1982 Supreme Court decision that recognized the right of all children, regardless of immigration status, to attend public school as long as they met the age and residency requirements set by state law.\par \par \uc2 ''The undocumented or noncitizen status of a student (or his or her parent or guardian) is irrelevant to that student's entitlement to an elementary and secondary public school education,'' said the memo, signed by Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for the civil rights division of the Justice Department; Russlynn H. Ali, assistant secretary for civil rights in the Education Department; and Charles P. Rose, that department's general counsel.\par \par \uc2 Xochitl Hinojosa, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said it was the first time her agency had issued guidance to school districts on the 1982 decision. The Education Department did not return calls seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 Civil liberties advocates, who had been asking President Obama's administration to clarify the law, hailed the memo. ''We're gratified that the Department of Justice has seen fit to do the right thing, to clarify any ambiguities,'' said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, calling the guidance ''a really big deal.''\par \par \uc2 Last year, Ms. Lieberman's group found that 139 districts in New York State -- about 20 percent of the total -- were requiring children's immigration papers as a prerequisite to enrollment, or asking parents for information that only lawful immigrants could provide.\par \par \uc2 While the group did not find any cases in which children had been turned away for lack of immigration paperwork, it warned that the requirements could deter \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families from enrolling children for fear that their status might be reported to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 After months of pressure from the civil liberties group, the state's Education Department sent school districts a memo strongly recommending that they not ask for information that might reveal the immigration status of enrolling students. State education officials in Maryland, New Jersey, Illinois and Nebraska have taken steps in recent years to halt similar practices, immigrant advocates said.\par \par \uc2 Despite the New York memo, some school districts there continued to press for the right to ask about immigration status, said Udi Ofer, advocacy director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, state lawmakers have considered a bill that would require the state's Education Department to determine the number of public school students who are unable to prove lawful presence in the United States, officials said. Last year, a legislative committee in Oklahoma favored a bill to require public schools to determine, at the time of enrollment, whether a child was born outside the United States.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110507e75700094\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc51}{\*\bkmkend toc51}\b \uc2 States Resisting Program Central to Obama's Immigration Strategy\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON   \par \uc2 1,113 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A program that is central to President Obama's strategy to toughen enforcement of immigration laws is facing growing resistance from state governments and police officials across the country.\par \par \uc2 Late Wednesday, Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois said he was pulling his state out of the program, known as Secure Communities, the first time a state has sought to withdraw entirely. In California, where the program is already under way throughout the state, the Legislature is considering a bill that would allow counties or police agencies to choose whether to participate.\par \par \uc2 In Massachusetts, Gov. Deval Patrick has held a series of heavily attended and sometimes raucous meetings on the program in an effort to vent criticism and build support for the administration's approach. In Maryland, Montgomery County considered withdrawing, then concluded reluctantly that it had to take part.\par \par \uc2 Under the program, the fingerprints of every person booked by the police are checked against Department of Homeland Security databases for immigration violations. That is in addition to routine checks against the F.B.I.'s criminal databases.\par \par \uc2 State officials and federal lawmakers have questioned the program, saying that Homeland Security officials conveyed misleading information about whether participation was mandatory or whether states could opt out. Some state officials, led by Governor Quinn, said the program was not accomplishing its stated goal of deporting convicted criminals, but had swept up many immigrants who were here illegally but had not been convicted of any crime.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama has begun an effort, seen on both sides of the aisle in Congress as an uphill fight, to win support for some kind of immigration legislation this year.\par \par \uc2 But the resistance to Secure Communities has exposed tensions in the president's immigration strategy, which has led to record numbers of deportations -- almost 800,000 -- in the past two years. The deportations have antagonized Latino immigrant communities that want Mr. Obama to press for legislation offering legal status to illegal immigrants, and that strongly supported Democrats in recent elections. Yet the deportations have not convinced many Republicans that the administration is strong enough on enforcement.\par \par \uc2 The states' objections are setting up a confrontation with the Department of Homeland Security, whose secretary, Janet Napolitano, has said that Secure Communities is mandatory and will be extended to all jurisdictions in the country by 2013. The program, started in Texas in 2008, is currently operating in more than 1,200 local jurisdictions.\par \par \uc2 At a Congressional hearing this week, Ms. Napolitano said that the program was crucial to the department's goal of finding criminal immigrants in state and local jails and deporting them.\par \par \uc2 Governor Quinn, in a letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that runs the Secure Communities program, said the Illinois State Police were withdrawing because the program had not met the terms of a 2009 agreement with the state. Under that memorandum, the program's purpose was to identify and deport immigrants ''who have been convicted of serious criminal offenses.''\par \par \uc2 Statistics from the immigration agency showed that nearly one-third of immigrants deported from Illinois under the program had no criminal convictions. It is a civil violation for an immigrant to be in the United States illegally; it is not a crime.\par \par \uc2 ''Illinois signed up to help I.C.E. remove criminals convicted of serious crimes, but based on the statistics from I.C.E., that's not what was happening,'' said Brie Callahan, the governor's spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 Governor Quinn, a Democrat, suspended the program in November and entered negotiations with homeland security officials. Illinois officials decided to withdraw after concluding that the immigration agency's operation of the program was ''flawed,'' the governor's office said.\par \par \uc2 So far, 26 out of 102 local jurisdictions in Illinois had begun participating. Governor Quinn asked the agency to ''deactivate'' those places.\par \par \uc2 Immigration agency officials said that John Morton, the head of the agency, would go to Springfield, Ill., on Friday to meet with officials there. In a statement, the agency said it was conducting a full review of the program ''to identify any irregularities that could indicate misconduct in particular jurisdictions'' and to tighten its focus on criminals.\par \par \uc2 Most criticism of the program has come from Democratic allies of Mr. Obama. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has asked him to suspend the program and re-organize it to focus more closely on deporting violent criminals, drug traffickers and other serious offenders. The American Immigration Lawyers Association also called on Mr. Obama this week to suspend the program.\par \par \uc2 Republicans in Congress, seeking even tougher enforcement of immigration laws, would like to see more of the program.\par \par \uc2 ''All too often, illegal immigrants who have committed crimes go on to commit more,'' said Lamar Smith of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. ''To make our streets safer, state and local governments should embrace Secure Communities,'' he said. ''Opposition to this program endangers Americans.''\par \par \uc2 California's concerns were first raised by several local law enforcement officials, including Michael Hennessey, the longtime sheriff of San Francisco. They argued that engaging local police in immigration enforcement would erode hard-earned trust with Latino and other immigrant communities. Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, the top-ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee, began questioning immigration agency officials on whether local police and governments could opt out.\par \par \uc2 This year, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, an immigrant advocate organization, obtained a trove of e-mails and other internal documents concerning Secure Communities from the immigration agency through a Freedom of Information request.\par \par \uc2 After examining those documents, Ms. Lofgren and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, also a Democrat, demanded that the homeland security inspector general open an investigation. Ms. Lofgren said officials had deliberately misled local governments into thinking they could choose to opt out of the program.\par \par \uc2 ''I believe that some false and misleading statements may have been made intentionally, while others were made recklessly,'' Mr. Lofgren wrote the inspector general.\par \par \uc2 In an apologetic response, Mr. Morton, the head of the immigration agency, said the agency ''takes full responsibility for the confusion and inconsistent statements'' about participation. But he said expanding Secure Communities remained a top priority.\par \par \uc2 In Massachusetts, Governor Patrick said late last year that he would accept the program statewide, then paused after an outcry from immigrant organizations, who said it was bound to catch many \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers with no criminal history. The town meetings he organized have drawn both opponents and very vocal supporters of the program.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Gov. Pat Quinn aims to take Illinois out of the program.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Two national civil rights law organizations sued the State of Utah on Tuesday, seeking to block a law that gives the police new powers to question people they stop about immigration status.\par \par \uc2 The law, signed by Gov. Gary R. Herbert in March, was an effort by legislators to crack down on illegal immigration while avoiding the costly legal challenges and polarizing political furor that followed a stricter law enacted last year in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 But the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center, based in Los Angeles, brought the class-action lawsuit claiming that the Utah statute violates federal civil rights and immigration law in ''myriad ways,'' mainly by interfering with immigration enforcement that is generally reserved for federal authorities. The groups are asking a federal judge to suspend the law before it goes into effect on May 10.\par \par \uc2 The Utah legal fight is one of many battles across the country, as several of states consider immigration crackdown bills late in the legislative season, and Latino and immigrant groups mobilize to try to stop a repeat of the Arizona law, known as S.B. 1070.\par \par \uc2 A tough immigration bill in Florida was changing by the hour in the State Senate over the past two days, as business and Latino leaders argued against it and lawmakers weighed its possible impact on the state's tourism and agriculture.\par \par \uc2 A bill similar to Arizona's is moving forward in Alabama. Georgia passed a tough enforcement bill last month that is awaiting the signature of Gov. Nathan Deal.\par \par \uc2 The legislature in Utah, looking for a political formula that would satisfy immigration hardliners without antagonizing the state's growing population of Latino workers, passed three bills in March, including one that created a guest-worker program providing legal work permits to illegal immigrants living in the state. A third bill set up a partnership with the state of Nuevo Leon in northern Mexico to bring in temporary farm workers under an existing federal program.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit challenged only Utah's enforcement bill. ''Federal immigration law leaves no room for this kind of intrusive state legislation,'' said Linton Joaquin, general counsel of the National Immigration Law Center.\par \par \uc2 Utah's attorney general, Mark Shurtleff, said he would vigorously defend the law. He said he had closely studied the Arizona law as well as a ruling by a federal judge that suspended central provisions of it. Mr. Shurtleff said Utah's law was written to avoid racial profiling and to codify police practices that were already routine.\par \par \uc2 Last week, Mr. Shurtleff met with Justice Department officials in Washington to try to persuade them not to bring a lawsuit against the state. Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has criticized the Obama administration for failing to sue Utah, as it did Arizona.\par \par \uc2 As Florida lawmakers debated, Latino and African-American civil rights leaders warned on Tuesday that they would consider a boycott or other measures against the state if a harsh immigration law passed.\par \par \uc2 ''Make no mistake about that: it will bring a loss of revenues, and it will do nothing to solve the immigration problem,'' said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza. She estimated that a boycott led by the groups in Arizona cost that state $490 million in lost tourism and convention business.\par \par \uc2 States have wrestled with the issue given the unlikely prospects for an overhaul of immigration laws to move forward in a divided Congress. But President Obama, in a meeting late Tuesday with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said he remained committed to trying to pass some form of immigration legislation this year, perhaps a bill limited to giving legal status to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students. The meeting was the president's third in as many weeks to try to revive some form of immigration legislation.\par \par \uc2 ''The president is just absolutely dedicated to the proposition that some legislation has to move,'' said Representative Charlie Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the Hispanic caucus.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, Mr. Gonzalez said, the Hispanic lawmakers pressed Mr. Obama to set guidelines so that young students with no criminal records who are picked up by immigration agents would not be deported.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus left the White House on Tuesday after a meeting with President Obama.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 For the last three years of his life, until he died in the crash of a bus returning to New York from a casino in Connecticut, Wang Jianhua lived beneath the radar, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  eking out a livelihood in Manhattan as a restaurant deliveryman.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, more than seven weeks after the accident, he was finally laid to rest after a small funeral that was just as quiet as his life. He was the last of the 15 crash victims to receive funeral rites.\par \par \uc2 The ceremony unfolded in a small, windowless room inside Ng Fook Funeral Services, on Mulberry Street in Chinatown. Mr. Wang's body, dressed in a dark suit and a black flat cap, lay in an open coffin bracketed by large bouquets.\par \par \uc2 About 20 people attended, including relatives, friends and co-workers; several had traveled by bus from other states, including Kentucky and North Carolina.\par \par \uc2 During the ceremony, Buddhist monks in saffron-colored robes chanted incantations and burned incense. Mr. Wang's widow, Lin Yaofang, who had flown in from China for the ceremony, sat near her husband's coffin, oscillating between bouts of weeping and mournful silence.\par \par \uc2 At one point, the mourners filed into a courtyard carrying bags of gold-leaf paper -- symbolizing money -- and cardboard models of a mansion, a car and servants, all objects meant to represent belongings that the deceased would want in the afterlife. Funeral home workers, adhering to Chinese tradition, tossed the objects into a large incinerator and set them on fire.\par \par \uc2 Then pallbearers from the funeral home carried Mr. Wang's coffin to a hearse, which ferried the body to Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn for cremation.\par \par \uc2 The long delay between Mr. Wang's death on March 12 and his memorial stemmed from Ms. Lin's wait for a visa. Finally granted one, she arrived in New York on April 25 and was met by one of her husband's close friends in New York, Lin Changshui.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lin, 34, said in an interview on Friday that her first several days in New York had been a blur. Her first stop was the funeral home: She wanted to see Mr. Wang's body with her own eyes. ''She cried all day,'' added Mr. Lin, who is not related to Ms. Lin.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lin has stayed with friends of her husband in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and has spent much of the trip running errands, including making funeral arrangements and buying black clothes for the ceremony.\par \par \uc2 During the week, Mr. Lin took her to see the two crowded tenements where her husband had lived in Lower Manhattan. Ms. Lin did not enter either but noted, with some surprise, how old and dirty they looked.\par \par \uc2 Like so many of his countrymen here, Mr. Wang, 40, who grew up poor in China, lived a hard life in America, working long hours and sending money back to China to support his wife and two young children. He was also helping to reimburse creditors who had lent him $75,000 to pay smugglers for his passage to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lin said she had no idea how tough her husband's life had been in New York: He never told her about his difficulties, not even about a broken arm from a bicycle accident that kept him out of work for several months. ''I didn't know anything about this country,'' she said. ''He'd call and say: 'Don't worry. I'm happy here.' ''\par \par \uc2 ''He was a good husband and he loved his children and was a good son,'' she added. ''He really took care of people.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lin said she planned to return to China soon, and hoped to find work; she assumed that her job as an office assistant in a boat factory had already been given to someone else. She said she could not see a way out from under the family's smuggling debt.\par \par \uc2 But she will be going home with some financial help. In response to articles about Mr. Wang published in The New York Times, readers have donated more than $5,000 to help his family. Readers and viewers of the Chinese-language news media in New York have also sent her checks, Ms. Lin said.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm really impressed by how kind Americans are,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Pallbearers at Ng Fook Funeral Services carried the coffin of Wang Jianhua, who came to the United States three years ago.; Lin Yaofang carried incense while mourning her husband on Monday. She tried for weeks to obtain a visa in China.

PAGE A4\par \par \uc2 National\par \par \uc2 BUSH LEADS EDUCATION PUSH\par \par \uc2 WITH 'FLORIDA FORMULA'\par \par \uc2 New policies governing the way schools operate have many champions, but a little-known common denominator behind sweeping measures in nearly a dozen states is Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, who has re-emerged as an adviser to governors and lawmakers, mostly Republicans, who are interested in imitating what he calls ''the Florida formula'' for education. PAGE A17\par \par \uc2 ENTWINED IN SEATTLE'S FABRIC\par \par \uc2 Paul Allen and \uc2 Bill Gates\uc2  have different recollections of the founding of \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  . But in Seattle, the city that has been their stage for three decades, they remain in constant, indirect contact. Their latest endeavors, legacies of the vast fortunes they made writing computer code, crisscross each other almost block by block. PAGE A15\par \par \uc2 PUSH TO STEM DEPORTATIONS\par \par \uc2 Democratic lawmakers and Latino and immigrant groups are increasing pressure President Obama to offer protection from deportation to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students who might have been eligible for legal status under a bill in Congress known as the Dream Act. PAGE A16\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 TRADING TRIAL CAPTIVATES\par \par \uc2 CITY'S SOUTH ASIANS\par \par \uc2 The trial of Raj Rajaratnam, who is accused of trading on illegal stock tips, has prompted soul-searching in South Asian circles. Some fear that a guilty verdict would tarnish the growing number of South Asians on Wall Street. Others feel that the case's only cultural significance is as a signal that South Asians have risen high enough in finance to be enmeshed in a multimillion-dollar debacle. PAGE A20\par \par \uc2 Business\par \par \uc2 SHIPPERS MAY RAISE\par \par \uc2 FUEL SURCHARGES\par \par \uc2 With diesel prices near their highest levels since 2008, the impact has started to appear in the first-quarter results of companies like Union Pacific railroad and the \uc2 Arkansas Best Corporation\uc2 , which has a trucking subsidiary. Some shippers said they expected to raise fuel surcharges. The timing, some economists say, could not be worse. PAGE B1\par \par \uc2 DELETING DIGITAL MEMORIES\par \par \uc2 Friendster, which started up in 2003, has long been eclipsed by younger, more nimble rivals, turning into something of a ghost town. But when its current owners told users of plans to change its business strategy -- and to wipe out the site's trove of digital memories, including ancient dorm-room photos, late-night blog entries and heartfelt friend endorsements, it set off a wave of nostalgia among Friendster members, even though most had stopped visiting the site long ago. PAGE B1\par \par \uc2 Sports\par \par \uc2 IN APPEAL BY N.F.L.,\par \par \uc2 ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE\par \par \uc2 What will happen next as the legal battle at the center of the N.F.L.'s labor stalemate heads to the the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is anyone's guess, but there are plenty of people willing to guess -- or to explain why guessing is foolhardy. PAGE B11\par \par \uc2 ON LUCK AND PITCHING\par \par \uc2 Phil Hughes's injury problems -- and the diminished version of Joba Chamberlain since his 2008 rotator-cuff injury in Texas -- highlight the difficulty of cultivating young pitching, and the fortune the Yankees enjoy in not having to rely on it.

PAGE B15\par \par \uc2 Arts\par \par \uc2 EVERY THEATRICAL HOUSE\par \par \uc2 SEEMS TO HAVE A DOCTOR\par \par \uc2 Once a discreet Broadway tradition, the use of script doctors and show doctors, usually hired to rework the story or the overall production, has evolved into a standard insurance policy -- accompanied in the Broadway way, with intrigue and gossip. PAGE C1\par \par \uc2 COVERING A MURDER TRIAL\par \par \uc2 Dwight Garner writes that Janet Malcolm's absorbing new book, ''Iphigenia in Forest Hills,'' covers a murder trial in Queens's Bukharan-Jewish community, and is squeamish about the way courts strip people of their secrets. PAGE C1\par \par \uc2 Dining\par \par \uc2 STAR CHEF, FACING A SUIT,\par \par \uc2 FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY\par \par \uc2 Geoffreyakarian has made all the right moves for a celebrity chef. But his latest step doesn't follow the script. He has filed for personal bankruptcy, a move that could help fend off more than $1 million in legal claims from 152 former cooks at Country in the Carlton Hotel, along with a former partner in the restaurant.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Olga Zanella, a Mexican-born college student in Texas, should have started months ago trying to figure out how she could make a life in Mexico, since American immigration authorities were working resolutely to deport her there.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Zanella, 20, could not bring herself to make plans. She was paralyzed by fear of a violent country she could not remember, where she had no close family.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Zanella, who has been living illegally in the United States since her parents brought her here when she was 5, had been trying to fight her deportation for more than two years. She was pulled over by the local police in February 2009 as she was driving in her hometown, Irving, Tex., and did not have a driver's license. The police handed her over to immigration agents.\par \par \uc2 Her case looked bleak, but in recent days everything changed. Last Thursday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official in Dallas summoned Ms. Zanella and told her she could remain in this country, under the agency's supervision, if she stayed in school and out of trouble.\par \par \uc2 Encouraged by the surprising turnaround, Ms. Zanella's parents and two siblings, who also had been living in the United States illegally, presented papers late Monday to ICE, as the agency is known, turning themselves in and requesting some form of legal immigration status.\par \par \uc2 ''It's an opportunity we are going to take,'' Ms. Zanella said in a telephone interview from Dallas. ''It's better than being in the shadows.''\par \par \uc2 The about-face by ICE in Ms. Zanella's case is an example of the kind of action Democratic lawmakers and Latino and immigrant groups have been demanding from the Obama administration to slow deportations of illegal immigrants who have not been convicted of crimes. In particular, pressure is increasing on President Obama to offer protection from deportation to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students who might have been eligible for legal status under a bill in Congress known as the Dream Act.\par \par \uc2 In an April 13 letter, the top two Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid of Nevada and Richard Durbin of Illinois, asked the president to suspend deportations for those students. But short of that, the senators asked Mr. Obama to set guidelines by which those students could come forward individually to ask to be spared deportation and to obtain some authorization to remain in the United States. The letter was signed by 20 other Senate Democrats. The Dream Act passed the House but failed in the Senate in December.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security officials have said their focus is increasingly on removing immigrants who are convicted criminals. That, in fact, is what an ICE official told Ms. Zanella in explaining the new decision in her case.\par \par \uc2 The agent said ICE ''was supposed to be concentrating on criminals, not on Dream students,'' said Ralph Isenberg, a Dallas businessman who advocates for immigrants and made it his cause to prevent Ms. Zanella from being deported. Mr. Isenberg's challenges to ICE had kept Ms. Zanella in the country even after the final date for her deportation in February.\par \par \uc2 ''As long as I do well in school and stay out of trouble, I will be out of trouble with ICE,'' Ms. Zanella said she was told. She has to report to ICE every month.\par \par \uc2 ICE officials declined to comment on the case, citing privacy policies.\par \par \uc2 ICE officials in central Florida recently invited immigration lawyers to bring forward illegal immigrants facing deportation who did not have criminal records, offering provisional authorization for them to remain here and work legally.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, immigration authorities suspended the deportation of Mariano Cardoso, 23, a Mexican student at Capital Community College in Connecticut, according to Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, who had pressed Mr. Cardoso's cause. ICE's decision ended a two-year battle against deportation for Mr. Cardoso.\par \par \uc2 But nationwide the administration's deportations policy remains confused and erratically implemented, immigration lawyers said, with many students and immigrants without criminal records being deported.\par \par \uc2 ''The administration needs to make it clear to the public and to the rank and file within ICE that it has a firm and clear policy of enforcing the law within its priorities and discouraging going after cases that are not within its priorities,'' said Gregory Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. ''But that is just not happening consistently.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Zanella is studying at North Lake College in Irving to become a dentist. The police in Irving never explained why they stopped her and never issued any traffic ticket, Mr. Isenberg said.\par \par \uc2 ICE agents made no promises to Ms. Zanella's family. Her father, Jose Victor Zanella, said: ''We are ready to trust in the system.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Olga Zanella, seated at right, with her mother, Oliva, her brother Victor and an immigration activist, Ralph Isenberg, back right.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 With prospects for an immigration overhaul looking dim, President Obama is facing increasing pressure from Latinos, Democratic lawmakers and immigrant groups to use his executive powers to offer relief from deportation to broad groups of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Demands for immediate action by Mr. Obama to slow the pace of the immigration crackdown in Latino communities have not eased since a White House meeting on Tuesday in which the president gathered political, business and religious leaders to brainstorm about how to revive the overhaul legislation, which is stalled in Congress.\par \par \uc2 Latinos and Democrats praised Mr. Obama for trying to jump-start efforts to pass the bill, which would grant legal status to millions of illegal immigrants. But with many leaders of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives strongly opposed to the measure, the bill's supporters remain skeptical that it will go anywhere before the presidential election next year.\par \par \uc2 They are calling on Mr. Obama to use authorities they say he already has under current immigration law to defer deportations of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who would be eligible for legal status under a bill known as the Dream Act.\par \par \uc2 ''We know that immigration reform is doable, but it is just rather difficult given the makeup of Congress,'' said Representative Charlie Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, who is chairman of the Hispanic Caucus in the House. ''We are asking the president if he could provide some sort of relief to innocent people who are the most impacted by the inequities of the immigration system.''\par \par \uc2 Religious and civil rights groups have asked Mr. Obama to expand waivers that would make it easier for illegal immigrants who are immediate relatives of American citizens to fix their legal status without having to leave the United States.\par \par \uc2 Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and 11 other lawmakers sent a letter asking the Obama administration to postpone deportations of immigrants in same-sex marriages with American citizens. The administration recently decided that it would no longer defend in the courts a law barring the federal government from recognizing those marriages.\par \par \uc2 Some Hispanic lawmakers, in the most ambitious demands, have said the president should halt deportations of illegal immigrants whose children are American citizens. An estimated four million young citizens have at least one parent who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Democrats are leaning on the White House as they look to the elections next year, when Latino voters could play pivotal roles in several crucial states. Under the Obama administration, immigration authorities have carried out record numbers of deportations, with nearly 400,000 immigrants removed in each of the last two years. The deportations are drawing increasingly irate protests from Latino communities.\par \par \uc2 But Republicans in Congress say the administration has not done enough to remove illegal immigrants, and they oppose any action by Mr. Obama that would offer what they call a ''stealth amnesty.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama ''should not selectively enforce the law,'' said Elton Gallegly, Republican of California, who is chairman of the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee. ''Amnesty -- whether universal or selective -- only encourages illegal immigration.''\par \par \uc2 Administration officials said Mr. Obama had rejected any move that would appear to circumvent Congress, which could alienate the handful of Republicans who might be persuaded to join an effort to pass the overhaul legislation. The president told the White House meeting on Tuesday that he did not believe there were any shortcuts he could use to help illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ''At the end of the day, the president cannot fix administratively what is broken in the immigration system,'' said a senior White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The official said the White House had made a strategic decision to focus all its efforts on passing the overhaul rather than acting unilaterally to make smaller changes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama first rejected executive action to suspend deportations during a town-hall-style meeting broadcast in late March on Univision, the Spanish-language television network.\par \par \uc2 But calls for him to change his mind have only multiplied since then. In a letter on April 13, the top two Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid of Nevada and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, and 20 other Democrats sent a letter asking the president to defer deportations of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students. The Dream Act bill passed the House but failed in the Senate last year.\par \par \uc2 Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, denounced the Democrats' letter in a speech on the floor. ''I'm just appalled that members of this body think an executive order to grant amnesty behind our backs is not an assault on the democratic process,'' Mr. Grassley said.\par \par \uc2 Acting case by case, the immigration authorities suspended deportations of 34,448 immigrants last year, according to figures sent to Mr. Grassley by the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, a critic of the administration on immigration, is touring the country holding town-hall-style meetings in Latino communities to demand the suspension of deportation for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: The Rev.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc57}{\*\bkmkend toc57}\b \uc2 Immigration Is Lead Topic As Leaders Are Gathered\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON   \par \uc2 476 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 April 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama told a gathering of business, labor, religious and political leaders at the White House on Tuesday that he remains committed to an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws and wants to try again in the coming months to push Congress to pass a bill.\par \par \uc2 With his re-election campaign launched this month and Latino communities growing increasingly frustrated with his immigration policies, Mr. Obama summoned more than 60 high-profile supporters of the stalled overhaul legislation to a strategy session, looking for ways to revive it. Among those attending were Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, an independent; Mayor Julian Castro of San Antonio, a Democrat; and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican.\par \par \uc2 Two big-city police chiefs, Raymond W. Kelly of New York and Charles Ramsey of Philadelphia, were there, as was \uc2 Sheryl Sandberg\uc2 , a top executive at \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , and Leith Anderson, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, the largest group of evangelical Christians.\par \par \uc2 Prospects for the proposed policy, which would grant legal status to millions of illegal immigrants and revamp the immigration system, seem bleak in this Congress, with staunch Republican opponents of the bill controlling pivotal committee positions in the House of Representatives. Recently Latino leaders have stepped up their criticism of Mr. Obama, as deportations have reached record numbers under his administration and he has offered no relief from the crackdown on immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 Latino voters helped several Democrats, including Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, survive the Republican shift in the midterm elections last fall, and they are expected to be a major force in the presidential vote next year.\par \par \uc2 In the closed meeting, Mr. Obama argued that the overhaul would bring immigrant entrepreneurs to the United States and was a crucial piece of the economic recovery, according to several people who attended. He sought views on whether to try to pass smaller pieces of the massive overhaul, such as a bill that would give legal status to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, or one that would increase visas for highly skilled foreign workers.\par \par \uc2 The president asked for help to ''change the debate'' to attract Republicans to support the bill. He said he could not pass the overhaul ''if I am leading the debate alone,'' according to a White House statement.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg suggested recasting the acrimonious discussion over the proposed policy to stress that it would not take jobs from Americans but would help the economy, said John Feinblatt, the chief policy adviser to the mayor, who was in the room.\par \par \uc2 ''We need an immigration policy that attracts the best, brightest and hardest working to our shores to help create jobs and spur growth,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. He has started a national campaign in support of the immigration bill.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110420e74k00031\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MANDURIA, Italy -- Under dark rain clouds on Tuesday afternoon, a group of about 10 immigrants hopped the thin wire fence surrounding the makeshift tent camp here and made a run for it into a silvery olive grove and the freedom of Italy beyond.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps they could have just walked.\par \par \uc2 ''Oh, let them go,'' a plainclothes officer standing near the camp's gate said loudly, his metal badge visible on his breast pocket.\par \par \uc2 The Italian government hastily built this camp in the Puglia region, the heel of Italy's boot, last weekend to help hold immigrants evacuated from Lampedusa, a tiny Italian island south of Sicily that is jammed with thousands of immigrants from North Africa who have crossed the Mediterranean in fishing boats and are now sleeping in the open air.\par \par \uc2 The Puglia center, which holds about 1,300 people, is an example of the logistical challenges that Italy -- and Europe -- face as they prepare for thousands of immigrants fleeing the unrest in North Africa. So far, most of them have been Tunisians seeking work, but last weekend the first boats arrived from Libya carrying Somalis and Eritreans who had been working there.\par \par \uc2 To some Italians, the tent camp is as much a political statement as a humanitarian reality, the product of a center-right government intent on demonstrating that the immigration situation has become an emergency that requires a coordinated European response. If the authorities wanted to dramatize the problem, some say, what better way than with photographs of immigrants escaping from crowded holding areas?\par \par \uc2 Others see the camp as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic standoff between Italy and France, the former colonial power in Tunisia and the place where most of the Tunisians say they want to go.\par \par \uc2 Under European Union law, the country where immigrants arrive is responsible for determining their status. Italy has argued that it should not bear the brunt of the new arrivals just because it is so close to North Africa. In a television interview on Wednesday, the Italian foreign minister, Franco Frattini, criticized France for its ''lack of solidarity'' after it returned more than 500 immigrants to Italy after they were caught trying to cross the border into France.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a political statement to France: 'You want to start the war in Libya? We'll give you immigrants,' '' said Tonio Tondo, a journalist following the immigration situation for the daily La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno. Italy, which colonized Libya in the early 20th century, stands to lose billions in investments there because of the allied intervention. Italy is taking part in the mission, but it was championed by France.\par \par \uc2 Here in Manduria, officials seem nonchalant about the escapes. Asked why the Italian authorities appeared to do so little to stop the immigrants' jumping the fence, Giuseppe Caruso, the police chief of Palermo and the special commissioner for the immigration emergency, asked rhetorically: ''What should we do? Should we shoot them?''\par \par \uc2 But the camp is rapidly emerging as a problem. The town's residents protested on Wednesday, calling for it to be closed because so many immigrants had escaped. Then both the mayor and Italy's deputy interior minister, Alfredo Mantovano, tendered their resignations after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said in a visit to Lampedusa on Wednesday that an additional 1,400 immigrants would be brought to Manduria. On Monday, Mr. Mantovano had pledged that the camp would not hold more than 1,500 people.\par \par \uc2 With its neat rows of blue tents on freshly laid gravel, and dozens of uniformed officials, the camp shows the power of the Italian state. But it also reveals its fissures. The camp is a legal no-man's land. The new arrivals' status -- are they illegal immigrants, refugees or asylum seekers? -- is uncertain, making it nearly impossible for the Italian authorities to process, repatriate or detain them.\par \par \uc2 Before the influx began in January, bringing about 18,000 people through Lampedusa, the immigrants who arrived there were held on the island for a few days before being sent to formal immigration or asylum centers on the mainland. The Interior Ministry says those centers are now almost full as Italy struggles with a bureaucratic backlog.\par \par \uc2 Under Italian law, immigrants can be held for up to 180 days to determine their status, and much longer if they are seeking asylum. If their arrival is deemed to be illegal, and they would not be subject to persecution in their home countries, they can be sent home. But Italy's repatriation accords with Tunisia and Libya have broken down.\par \par \uc2 ''We're waiting for a directive,'' said Antonio Calcagni, the chief of the immigration office at the Police Department in the nearby port city of Taranto, as he stood outside the Manduria camp. ''Different countries are working on it,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 The immigrants have grown frustrated, too. ''We've been here for three days,'' said Omar Naim, 24, a Tunisian, as he peered through the fence. ''They haven't done anything for us.''\par \par \uc2 Italian officials traveled last week to Tunisia, which still lacks a functioning government, to persuade the authorities there to honor the repatriation accords.\par \par \uc2 ''What's the legal status of the camp? That's a good question,'' said Nichi Vendola, the president of the Puglia region and a leading member of the center-left opposition. ''Is it a place for determining who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ? A place to receive asylum seekers? A hybrid place?'' He added, ''The confusion is the fruit of the ideological prejudices of the Northern League, which dominates the Berlusconi government.''\par \par \uc2 That party, the most powerful in the governing center-right coalition, has long drawn on fears of illegal immigration. Asked on Tuesday what should be done about the immigrants, the Northern League's colorful leader, Umberto Bossi, used a phrase that politely translates as ''get them out of our faces.''\par \par \uc2 The interior minister, Roberto Maroni, a member of the Northern League, has been more diplomatic, but has repeatedly said the European Union has abandoned Italy. The Italian government is not alone in seeking a more coordinated European response. Laura Boldrini, spokeswoman for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Italy, said it was important to distinguish between the ''economic migrants'' from Tunisia who were seeking work in Europe and those fleeing the fighting in Libya.\par \par \uc2 ''In the event of a mass influx of asylum seekers from Libya, the U.N.H.C.R. recommends that member states receive them and give them temporary protection,'' Ms. Boldrini said. ''It would be good to have a positive sign from Europe,'' she added. ''That could also help reduce tensions and calm down tones in Italy.''\par \par \uc2 Back in Manduria, as bulldozers worked the ground and trucks carted in generators, the camp seemed increasingly less temporary. Mr. Calcagni, the immigration chief for the Taranto police, looking resigned, cited an often-used Italian saying: ''There's nothing more definitive than something provisional.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: A Tunisian struggled through the fence at the camp in Manduria, Italy, on Tuesday but then jumped back over it when he saw guards nearby.; More than 1,300 immigrants are being kept in the tent city. Most are Tunisians, but boats from Libya began to arrive last weekend.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc59}{\*\bkmkend toc59}\b \uc2 Southern Lawmakers Focus on Illegal Immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By KIM SEVERSON; Robbie Brown contributed reporting.   \par \uc2 900 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 March 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Some of the toughest bills in the nation aimed at illegal immigrants are making their way through legislatures in the South.\par \par \uc2 Proposed legislation in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, where Republicans control the legislatures and the governors' mansions, have moved further than similar proposals in many other states, where concerns about the legality and financial impact of aggressive immigration legislation have stopped lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of immigration-related bills showed up early in legislative sessions across the South. Some were aimed at keeping illegal immigrants from college or from marrying American citizens. Most died quickly, but three proposals designed to give police broader powers to identify and report illegal immigrants are moving forward.\par \par \uc2 The conservative political landscape, and a relatively recent and large addition of Latinos, both new immigrants and legal residents from other states, have contributed to the batch of legislation, say supporters and opponents of the proposed laws.\par \par \uc2 ''The South has become a new gateway for immigrants,'' said Wendy Sefsaf of the Immigration Policy Center, a research organization. ''People see the culture shift, and they are a little bit freaked out.''\par \par \uc2 The Hispanic population in Alabama, for example, has increased by 144 percent since 2000, according to new census figures. In Mississippi, the numbers jumped by 106 percent, and in North Carolina by 111 percent. Over all, however, numbers remain small. Only about 4 percent of the population in Alabama is Hispanic. In South Carolina, the figure is 5 percent.\par \par \uc2 But Georgia has the seventh-largest population of illegal immigrants in the country, according to a report by the Pew Hispanic Center. There, a version of a law pioneered in Arizona would allow local police officers to inquire about the immigration status of people they suspect of committing crimes, including traffic violations.\par \par \uc2 It allows people to sue local agencies if they believe the law is not being enforced and also requires that some businesses use E-Verify, a free federal employment eligibility database.\par \par \uc2 Backers of the bill and opponents, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center, say it stands a good chance of making it to Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican who has not yet said whether he will sign it, despite voicing support for strong immigration controls during his campaign last year.\par \par \uc2 The Georgia Senate also passed a bill this month that would charge an undocumented resident caught driving drunk with a felony. American citizens face only a misdemeanor charge.\par \par \uc2 At a rally at the Georgia State Capitol on Thursday, several thousand people showed up to protest the legislation. Many were Hispanic workers from around the state who had taken the day off to attend.\par \par \uc2 Six Georgia lawmakers who are pushing the House version of the bill issued a statement after the march saying, ''There are millions of Georgia citizens working and raising their families who no longer are willing to accept the loss of job opportunities to the nearly 500,000 illegal aliens in our state or to subsidize their presence with their hard-earned tax dollars.''\par \par \uc2 State Senator Jack Murphy, a Republican who sponsored another version of the legislation, said his bill was written carefully to avoid some the problems that backers of the Arizona law have encountered, including accusations of racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want to cost business and jobs by having some image problem,'' he said. ''My bill specifically says you will not profile.''\par \par \uc2 A similar bill is heading through the legislature in South Carolina. It would also make it illegal to transport immigrants anywhere, including a hospital or a church.\par \par \uc2 In Alabama, legislators are working on similar bills in the House and the Senate, which would also make it a crime to knowingly rent to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Legislators leading the efforts say their bills are not based in racism, nor are they anti-immigration. They simply want to better control the flow of people into the United States and be fair to those who have arrived through proper channels. Without federal action, the states have a responsibility to step in.\par \par \uc2 ''The bill is intended to make South Carolina a very hostile place for those who are in this country illegally,'' said State Senator Lawrence K. Grooms. ''Our hope is that they leave the country or go to a state where they are more welcome.''\par \par \uc2 That might be happening. The pending legislation in Georgia is regularly discussed among customers at the little taqueria in the back of Mercado Acupulco, an Atlanta grocery store.\par \par \uc2 For four years, business at the store was good, said Maira Garcia, 25, whose father owns the business. But lately, Ms. Garcia and other business owners who cater to a Latino clientele have seen fewer customers. People are planning to leave Georgia to go back to their home countries or to other states where the perception is that life will be easier, she and her customers said.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm hearing rumors that things are going to change real bad,'' said Raul Martinez Soto, 23, who moved to the United States from Morelia, Mexico, about four years ago. ''Everyone is scared,'' he said. ''They ask what is the point to kicking us out of here?''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Maira Garcia says her Latino clientele has dwindled as Georgia's legislation has advanced.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Three months after the defeat of the Dream Act, a Congressional bill that would have provided a path to legal residency for young illegal immigrants, a state senator from New York City has introduced his own version of the legislation in Albany.\par \par \uc2 Unlike its federal counterpart, the bill would not offer those immigrants a path to legal residency. But it would give some of them certain rights now granted only to legal residents and citizens, including the ability to hold some state jobs -- a provision that appears to challenge federal laws that prohibit the hiring of undocumented workers.\par \par \uc2 The bill would allow illegal immigrants to get driver's licenses, a proposal that will undoubtedly reprise the fiery debates that compelled Gov. Eliot Spitzer to drop a similar plan in 2007.\par \par \uc2 State Senator Bill Perkins, a Manhattan Democrat who introduced the bill this week, acknowledged the challenges confronting it. ''There's politics and other types of obstacles that must be overcome,'' Mr. Perkins said in an interview on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The bill is one in a recent wave of state measures -- some intended to empower immigrants, others meant to toughen the enforcement of immigration laws -- that have been proposed in response to inaction in Washington. A number of state legislatures have considered versions of the Dream Act, most of them intended to allow students who are illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition rates for public colleges and universities, and to receive state financial aid.\par \par \uc2 This year, with Republicans newly in control of legislatures across the country, many state governments have vowed to pass bills to crack down on illegal immigrants; they include proposals resembling an Arizona law that expanded the powers of police officers to question the immigration status of people they stop.\par \par \uc2 State Senator Daniel L. Squadron, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan who is co-sponsoring the New York bill, said the legislation was prompted by the failure of the Dream Act, which passed the House but was blocked by the Senate in December. ''This allows New York to take the lead in a place where the federal government hasn't yet succeeded,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 New York allows illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition, but the bill would give them access to state financial support, including grants, loans and scholarships. Its most ambitious proposals are those seeking to provide certain illegal immigrants with ''state identification or driver's licenses'' and ''work opportunities with the State of New York.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Squadron said the bill did not seek to undermine federal laws that prohibit employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. But, he said, it ''could potentially expand the state's options within the federal limits.'' He added that he was still studying the potential effects of the bill on employment.\par \par \uc2 To qualify for the benefits of the legislation, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  would need to have entered the United States before age 16, be younger than 35 and have lived in New York for at least two years before the law's effective date. Among other requirements, the immigrant would have to have completed at least two years of a four-year degree in a college or university in the state, served at least two years in the New York National Guard or completed 910 hours of community service. Convicted felons would not be eligible.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Perkins said that he hoped the bill would attract support in the Legislature, but that he had not yet surveyed his peers or sounded out Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. ''Nobody has yet said this is ridiculous, or anything negative in that vein,'' Mr. Perkins said.\par \par \uc2 But several officials who loudly opposed Mr. Spitzer's measure four years ago did not hesitate to criticize the new bill on Wednesday. Homing in on the driver's license clause, Assemblyman James N. Tedisco, a Republican from Schenectady, said he anticipated opposition to that provision -- and, by extension, the bill -- would be strong.\par \par \uc2 ''It's just as wrong now as it was under Eliot Spitzer,'' he said. ''I think it's a bill to nowhere.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110324e73o000bh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc61}{\*\bkmkend toc61}\b \uc2 Arizona, Bowing to Business, Softens Stand on Immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   \par \uc2 947 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 March 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Arizona established itself over the past year as the most aggressive state in cracking down on illegal immigrants, gaining so much momentum with its efforts that several other states vowed to follow suit. But now the harsh realities of economics appear to have intruded, and Arizona may be looking to shed the image of hard-line anti-immigration pioneer.\par \par \uc2 In an abrupt change of course, Arizona lawmakers rejected new anti-immigration measures on Thursday, in what was widely seen as capitulation to pressure from business executives and an admission that the state's tough stance had resulted in a chilling of the normally robust tourism and convention industry.\par \par \uc2 The State Senate voted down five bills that among other things sought to require hospitals to inform law enforcement officials when treating patients suspected of being in the country illegally and to prod the Supreme Court to rule against automatic citizenship for American-born children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Senate move was a victory for the Arizona business lobby, which on many issues is more moderate than state lawmakers. And it was a rebuke for the State Senate president, Russell Pearce, a Republican and the driving force behind tough immigration measures, including the law passed last April requiring police to question the status of anyone they stop if they have a ''reasonable suspicion'' that the person might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the five bills said that the state's image had been hit hard, and that it did not make sense to pass new measures while the state had already put itself so far out in front of other states and the federal government on the issue -- at a cost to tourism and other industries.\par \par \uc2 They said that previous immigration bills were still being reviewed by the courts, and that it was not smart to pass new legislation that plainly conflicted with the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't believe that anyone, including myself, foresaw the national and international reaction'' to April's bill, said Glenn Hamer, chief executive of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who said estimates of lost tourism business ranged from $15 million to $150 million. ''Now we have that experience under our belts. We know these measures can cause economic damage; it's just a matter of degree.''\par \par \uc2 A letter signed by 60 state business leaders this week blamed last year's bill for boycotts, canceled contracts, declining sales and other economic setbacks.\par \par \uc2 ''Arizona's lawmakers and citizens are right to be concerned about illegal immigration,'' the letter said. ''But we must acknowledge that when Arizona goes it alone on this issue, unintended consequences inevitably occur.''\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Hamer said he doubted the bills could have been defeated on Thursday without broad-based business opposition, he cautioned that support for tighter restrictions on immigration remained strong in a number of quarters. But, he added, ''Our hope is that these types of measures have crested and we could spend our time on efforts that could rebuild our economy.''\par \par \uc2 Indeed, state politicians and other officials interviewed after the bills' defeat said it was too soon to tell whether the turnabout represented a long-term change, or merely a breather until the economy rebounds. Concerns about illegal immigration remain a significant issue, and many state leaders are angry with what they describe as the federal government's unwillingness to take firm action.\par \par \uc2 But for now, ''enough is enough,'' said State Senator John McComish, a Republican who voted no on all five bills.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, did not take a position on the five bills that were voted down Thursday -- her normal practice on legislation that has not reached her desk, a spokesman said on Friday.\par \par \uc2 An aide said Senator Pearce was unavailable for comment.\par \par \uc2 Crucial to changing the discussion was a clearly articulated and executed strategy by the state business lobby, which made concerns over negative economic effects a far more significant factor than in the debate last year.\par \par \uc2 State Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, said business opposition -- in contrast to what she called the tepid and delayed efforts of its leaders last year -- gave Republicans the political protection they needed to vote no.\par \par \uc2 ''They have been working since January to provide people cover against these bills,'' Senator Sinema said. Twenty-one of 30 state senators are Republicans, and none of the bills would have been defeated without many of them voting in opposition.\par \par \uc2 The effect on the state's convention and tourism industry after the April vote was immediate. Convention bookings plunged in Phoenix, one of the top destinations in the United States, with large organizations citing the immigration bill when canceling their reservations.\par \par \uc2 ''It was definitely a drastic decline,'' said Kristen Jarnagin, vice president of communications for the Arizona Hotel and Lodging Association. She and other business officials pointed to data on bookings showing Phoenix's ranking, on some measures, had dropped from the top four destinations nationwide to 23rd.\par \par \uc2 So far, Arizona-style anti-immigration bills have not lived up to their advance billing in other states, which despite strengthened Republican legislative majorities have failed to pass any identical bills. Similar proposals are still advancing in some states, but they, too, have encountered strong business opposition.\par \par \uc2 ''Our legislature and our state are suffering from immigration fatigue,'' Senator McComish said. ''We've been at the forefront of this issue, and I think it is time for a timeout.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Senators Russell Pearce, left, and Steve Gallardo during debate on the anti-immigration measures in the Senate on Thursday.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc62}{\*\bkmkend toc62}\b \uc2 Casinos and Buses Cater to New Yorkers With Asian Roots\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID W. CHEN \par \uc2 1,146 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 March 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 They are fixtures in Chinese newspapers: promotions for the Mohegan Sun, Foxwoods and Bally's casinos. And they list the bus departures, from Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and Flushing, Queens.\par \par \uc2 At the gambling halls, Asian hosts, fluent in multiple dialects, welcome customers with koi ponds designed by feng shui consultants. Asian game rooms feature table games like pai gow poker and sic bo. For meal breaks, Asian restaurants in the casinos dish out congee and roast duck.\par \par \uc2 Gambling requires a certain amount of luck, but when it comes to wooing the huge pool of Asian-Americans in New York City, who fill buses bound for local casinos, as little as possible is left to chance.\par \par \uc2 It is part of an unspoken compact among the casinos, the bus companies and the city's vast Chinese population, rooted in tradition, opportunity and vice. But it has come under a public spotlight after a bus crash on Saturday that killed 15 people returning to Chinatown from an outing to the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut.\par \par \uc2 For years, casinos and bus companies have relied on a symbiotic relationship to cater to an Asian-American clientele that accounts for as much as 25 percent of casino revenues.\par \par \uc2 Even after the last chips have been cashed, or the debts tallied, casinos stay in touch with their best customers by sending postcards highlighting future events like the Miss New York Chinese Beauty Pageant or concerts headlined by pop stars from Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 The personal touch is common, as well, one marketing executive who has worked with casinos said. ''They'll call you up and say, 'Why don't you come up and have a special steak dinner on us? Why don't you come up for a concert?' '' said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to anger clients.\par \par \uc2 And even as investigators try to determine what caused the deadly accident on Saturday, one thing is certain: Given a spate of new casinos opening in Pennsylvania, the lucrative and sophisticated competition to lure those customers to Connecticut, Atlantic City and elsewhere will not just continue but most likely intensify.\par \par \uc2 Culture is one reason gambling is so popular among Asian-Americans, especially Chinese-Americans. Asian-Americans, carrying on a tradition from their homelands, embrace games of chance and skill like mah-jongg, both to make a bit of money and to be sociable; Las Vegas has long counted on a strong Asian clientele.\par \par \uc2 In Chinatown in New York City, generations of men have played tile games in basements. But with the emergence of Atlantic City in the late 1970s and Connecticut gambling halls in the late 1990s, casinos became the preferred outlet, said Paul J. Q. Lee, a longtime community leader in Chinatown, and a former owner of a bus company that traveled to casinos.\par \par \uc2 These days, virtually every casino has an Asian marketing department, ensuring that cultural sensitivities are accommodated.\par \par \uc2 The Mount Airy casino, in the Poconos, enlisted several designers versed in feng shui. Some casinos assiduously avoid using the numbers 4 and 10, which sound like the Chinese word for death. Mohegan Sun has a Chinese-language Web site featuring the fortuitous number eight three times.\par \par \uc2 To reach their customers, casinos rely on the machinery of an old-fashioned political campaign: direct mail, newspaper advertisements and posters. But social media? Not much.\par \par \uc2 ''They're not going to go to \uc2 Facebook\uc2 ,'' said Peter Yee, assistant executive director of behavioral health at Hamilton-Madison House, a social service center on the Lower East Side. ''They're going to go to someone's uncle. It's word of mouth.''\par \par \uc2 And casinos know their customer base. On Tuesday, for instance, The World Journal, the leading Chinese daily newspaper catering to Mandarin speakers, featured advertisements for casino buses to Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods with pick-up locations chiefly in Flushing and Elmhurst, both of which have large Mandarin-speaking populations. But Sing Tao, the leading paper for Cantonese speakers, emphasized pick-up locations for buses to Bally's, Tropicana and other casinos in Cantonese neighborhoods like Sunset Park and Chinatown.\par \par \uc2 The promotions are similar. For as little as $8 per bus ticket, customers are offered a free meal (worth $15) and a gambling voucher (worth up to $45).\par \par \uc2 Some community leaders criticize the casinos as preying upon a vulnerable and predominantly elderly population. ''You make these things attractive, easy and available, and not everybody has self-control,'' said Peter Kwong, a professor of Asian-American studies at Hunter College. ''It's almost like \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  giving out free burgers to kids so they can get hooked on it.''\par \par \uc2 Others say that while the marketing may be predatory, the trips to nearby casinos are harmless. ''I see people bringing their kids up there,'' said Mr. Yee, who calls himself a recreational gambler. ''There's a whole subculture that exists.''\par \par \uc2 One integral part to the success -- or failure -- of a casino trip is the relationship between the casinos and the bus operators. In many cases, casinos provide subsidies to the bus companies that can offset most, if not all, of the buses' operating costs. ''The casinos work very closely with the bus operators,'' said George Toth. a former chief executive of Mount Airy in Pennsylvania, and the Sands in Atlantic City.\par \par \uc2 The buses themselves have their own subculture, and even a hierarchy, said Mr. Lee, the former bus company owner.\par \par \uc2 In the front are the regulars, people who go to the casinos several times a week and are easily recognized by bus operators. These often include grandmothers who have a couple of hundred dollars, thanks to their own savings and money from the children. Behind them are the waiters who have just been paid, and are likely to carry a lot of cash, and the newcomers. And in the back, near the bathroom, are the non-Chinese and people who want only to pick up a free meal and to sell their vouchers at a discount.\par \par \uc2 Orchestrating it all is the ''tour guide,'' or ''daoyou'' in Chinese. Often an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , she (and it is almost always a she) functions as a multitasking, ticket-collecting, peace-making liaison. ''These individuals are very, very important,'' Mr. Lee said. ''They make sure that Mrs. Wong from East Broadway is happy.''\par \par \uc2 The tour guide often sits in the front, chatting nonstop with the bus driver, making sure the driver does not fall asleep, especially on overnight trips. It is not clear what happened on the fateful bus crash on Saturday, but one of the 15 people killed was the tour guide.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Marketers for gambling halls cater to Asian- Americans.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Under newly fortified Republican control, many state governments started the year pledging forceful action to crack down on illegal immigration, saying they would fill a void left by the stalemate in Washington over the issue.\par \par \uc2 Now, with some legislatures winding down their sessions, the lack of consensus that has immobilized Congress has shown up in the legislatures as well, and has slowed -- but not stopped -- the advance of bills to penalize illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 No state has passed a law that replicates the one adopted last April in Arizona, which greatly expanded the powers of police officers to question the immigration status of people they stop.\par \par \uc2 Still, immigrant advocates in many states say the debate has clearly shifted in favor of tougher enforcement. They say they have had to fight just to hold the line on immigration issues that they thought were long settled.\par \par \uc2 Bills similar to Arizona's are advancing in Florida, Kansas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. In Kansas and Oklahoma, even though Republicans control the legislatures and the executive branch, immigration proposals have encountered unusually vocal opposition from business.\par \par \uc2 Arizona-style bills died early in Colorado, and Nebraska decided this month to end its debate on one. Arizona's law requires state and local police officers to inquire about the immigration status of anyone they stop if they have a ''reasonable suspicion'' the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 States also wrestled with other kinds of immigration initiatives. In New Mexico and Washington, Democrats backed by immigrant advocates defeated efforts to repeal laws granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. Those two states and Utah are the only ones that give licenses to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In New Mexico, the repeal effort was championed by Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican and a Hispanic, who had promised such a move in her campaign last year. A bill she supported was defeated by the Democratic-controlled State Senate on Wednesday. Instead, it approved a bill that added requirements, including fingerprinting, for immigrants without a Social Security number who apply for licenses.\par \par \uc2 If that bill wins final approval and the governor's signature, it will create a two-tiered system in which licenses issued to people without proof of legal residence will be distinctively marked. According to license authorities, about 83,000 illegal immigrants are driving in New Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Martinez vowed to continue to fight for the repeal, although this is the final week of the legislative session. She called the current law ''dangerous'' and accused Democrats of ''partisan political gamesmanship'' for blocking its repeal.\par \par \uc2 Marcela Diaz, executive director of Somos Un Pueblo Unido, a group that led the license fight, said, ''It's a good sign that we will be able to maintain licenses for folks who are living, working and paying taxes in our state, regardless of their immigration status.''\par \par \uc2 But, she said, ''We don't take anything for granted.''\par \par \uc2 In Washington State, the debate over driver's license rules polarized a state that has been relatively tolerant of illegal immigrants, an important part of the work force that picks apples. Several Democrats joined Republicans in supporting a repeal of the license law.\par \par \uc2 State fiscal authorities estimated that the repeal would cost about $1.5 million a year in new verification technology and monitoring expenses. That swayed some budget-minded lawmakers, and the bill was killed Monday.\par \par \uc2 ''We saw tremendous momentum against us,'' said Pramila Jayapal, executive director of OneAmerica, an immigrant advocate group. ''But there was a realization that the debate was very divisive, and it was not going to solve the immigration problem.''\par \par \uc2 In Utah, where the Legislature finished its session on Thursday, lawmakers passed a novel package of three immigration laws. One was a revised version of the Arizona bill, without the most controversial parts. It requires the police to verify the immigration status of people they arrest on suspicion of committing a felony or serious misdemeanor. It allows, but does not require, the police to inquire about the status of people booked for lesser crimes.\par \par \uc2 ''My bill is quite different than Arizona's,'' said State Representative Stephen Sandstrom, a Republican who was the main author of the measure.\par \par \uc2 Another law authorized the creation of a state guest worker program by 2013, and instructed the governor and the state attorney general to negotiate with federal authorities for a waiver to allow Utah employers to hire illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sandstrom said he was ''completely against'' the guest worker bill, which he called ''a tragedy for the state.'' He said that the law was unconstitutional and unlikely to take effect, but that it would still lure illegal immigrants to Utah.\par \par \uc2 Utah's attorney general, Mark Shurtleff, acknowledged that the proposed waiver does not exist in federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a federal crime to employ an illegal alien,'' he said in an interview. ''I don't know how you get a waiver for a federal crime. I'm going to try. But it's definitely an uphill battle.''\par \par \uc2 Those two measures venture into terrain generally reserved for federal immigration authorities and are likely to draw legal challenges from advocacy groups, although they appear less likely to be challenged by the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 Utah's third new immigration law creates a labor commission to work with Nuevo Leon State in Mexico to bring laborers to Utah through existing federal guest worker programs. Mr. Shurtleff, who is a Republican, was the force behind that law.\par \par \uc2 The initiatives had the support of Utah businesses and law enforcement agencies.\par \par \uc2 In a national meeting of attorneys general last week, Mr. Shurtleff unveiled a proposal for a ''national compact'' to serve as a model for immigration legislation in Congress, based on Utah's approach of enforcement measures paired with an opening to legal status for illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 In Texas, the biggest news from the immigration debate was a bill by State Representative Debbie Riddle, a Republican. Her legislation would penalize employers hiring illegal immigrants, with an exception for family households employing baby sitters or gardeners.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant groups and Democrats accused Ms. Riddle of hypocrisy, saying she wanted to deport illegal immigrants, except for her friends' nannies.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico says she will continue to push for a repeal of a state law that grants driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. The State Senate defeated a bill she supported.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- In Arizona, fervor against illegal immigration is so intense that politicians have pushed some of the nation's toughest laws and citizen activists have patrolled the border themselves. But census data released Thursday show another side of the population story: Arizonans are increasingly becoming Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 Still, the increase in Hispanics, to just under 30 percent of the population last year from 25 percent in 2000, has been slower than some studies predicted. Tough economic times coupled with restrictions on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers are probably responsible for driving many Hispanics away, analysts say.\par \par \uc2 ''The Hispanic population has gone up, but it didn't go up as much as people thought,'' said Tom Rex, associate director of the Center for Competitiveness and Prosperity Research at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. ''Or maybe it did go up and then dropped when those who got here couldn't find jobs.''\par \par \uc2 Over all, Arizona's population has boomed to 6.4 million from 5.1 million over the last decade, at a rate second only to Nevada's, and much of the growth is a result of a 46 percent increase in the Hispanic population, said Bill Schooling, the state demographer.\par \par \uc2 Significant increases in Hispanics were reported across the state: in the Phoenix metropolitan area, where the bulk of the state's residents live, as well as in the border counties of Yuma, Pima and Santa Cruz and in remote northwestern Mohave County, bordering California and Nevada, where the Hispanic population grew 72 percent.\par \par \uc2 The most popular names in the state reflect the diversity: Isabella, Sophia, Emma and Olivia are the most popular girls' names in Arizona while Jacob, Anthony, Daniel, Alexander and Angel top the boy's list.\par \par \uc2 ''Without a doubt, wherever you turn, there are Latin people,'' said Luis Lim, a political columnist for Prensa Hispana, the state's largest Spanish-language publication.\par \par \uc2 The popular image of Arizona as a state of white retirees has always been a caricature, experts say. ''We're not an old, white person's state,'' Mr. Rex said. ''Our age distribution is not all that different from the national average. It's quite a mixed state, despite the legislation that is passed here.''\par \par \uc2 There may be demographic reasons for the conservative politics as well. Despite the size of the Hispanic population, nearly 40 percent of it is under age 18 and an untold number of others are not legally able to vote, meaning the numbers do not translate into political clout.\par \par \uc2 On top of that, Latino community activists here suspect that there was probably a significant undercount of the state's Hispanic population, with many not participating to make a political point.\par \par \uc2 ''They did not want to participate because they did not want the additional money that the state could get to be utilized by law enforcement and the persecution of people that are brown,'' said Salvador Reza, a community activist.\par \par \uc2 GRAPHICS: Big Gains for Hispanics in Phoenix Area . . .: From 2000 to 2010, the Hispanic population increased by 48 percent in Maricopa County, which includes much of the Phoenix-Mesa metropolitan area. Hispanics make up 30 percent of the entire population in the area.; . . . But Not For Whites: The white population in Maricopa County increased by 10 percent, growing at a much slower pace than Hispanics. The overall share of whites in the area decreased to 59 percent in 2010 from two-thirds in 2000.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 ''No Exit From a Bad Program'' (editorial, Feb. 28) claims that the Secure Communities program is problematic because it results in the arrest and deportation of illegal immigrants with little or no criminal record. Such a view is misguided and dangerous.\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities is the Department of Homeland Security's comprehensive strategy to improve the identification and removal of criminal aliens from the United States.\par \par \uc2 While not perfect, this sensible program allows for an automated immigration-history check to be run at the same time as the routine criminal-history check done on every person booked into a local jail. It flags criminals who are foreign nationals and sends a notification to D.H.S., which can choose to remove the offender.\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities simply makes sense. Who wouldn't want to remove an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has been arrested by the police for a criminal offense? To make our streets safer, local law enforcement agencies should embrace the Secure Communities program. Opposition to this program is dangerous and foolish.\par \par \uc2 Sue Myrick\par \par \uc2 Member of Congress, 9th Dist., N.C.\par \par \uc2 Washington, Feb. 28, 2011\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration is putting out an inconsistent message regarding its priorities for immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities, by resulting in the deportation of thousands of immigrants without criminal records, shifts resources away from handling dangerous criminals and actually makes communities less secure. It's decidedly at odds with President Obama's declared intention to work hard for serious and comprehensive immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 In response to the administration's mixed messages, and Congress's unwillingness to act, state legislatures are proposing some of the most virulently anti-immigrant bills in United States history. One such bill in Arizona would require hospitals to check patients' immigration status. Another in Arizona would create a different set of birth certificates for United States citizen children of undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Georgia is considering a bill that would turn a United States citizen who gives a ride to an undocumented immigrant into a criminal, while Kentucky has proposed legislation that would make mere presence in Kentucky as an undocumented immigrant a state crime.\par \par \uc2 Such bills will only proliferate as long as federal immigration policy remains confused and unclear. Until then, immigrants and United States citizens alike will continue to live in communities that are increasingly insecure.\par \par \uc2 Grace Meng\par \par \uc2 Researcher, U.S. Program\par \par \uc2 Human Rights Watch\par \par \uc2 New York, Feb. 28, 2011\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110311e73b0003k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Adopts Immigration Alternative\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON   \par \uc2 1,183 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 March 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In the first move by a state to extend legal recognition to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  laborers, the Utah Legislature has passed immigration bills that include a guest worker program that would allow unauthorized foreigners to work legally in the state.\par \par \uc2 With the immigration package, passed in both chambers of the Republican-controlled Legislature late Friday, Utah made a sharp break with the hard-line trend in state immigration legislation that has been led by Arizona, which passed a strict enforcement law last April.\par \par \uc2 Utah's package includes measures to tighten enforcement against illegal immigrants that echo Arizona's tough stance -- like a requirement that the police check the immigration status of anyone arrested on a felony or a serious misdemeanor charge.\par \par \uc2 But supporters said the hybrid package offered an alternative to states, including those controlled by Republicans, that are seeking to avoid the costly political polarization and legal challenges that followed Arizona's law and that also want to recognize the need of some businesses for immigrant labor in spite of high unemployment nationally.\par \par \uc2 The guest worker bill came after intense lobbying by business and farm groups as well as by some immigrant advocates, and it enjoyed the quiet but all-important endorsement of the Mormon Church. It is likely to raise many of the same constitutional questions as the Arizona law, including whether it intrudes on areas of immigration law reserved exclusively for the federal government. Central provisions of Arizona's law, known as S. B. 1070, were suspended by federal courts pending a lawsuit by the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 But in contrast to Arizona's approach, Utah lawmakers framed their bill to set up a negotiation, rather than a confrontation, between the governor and the federal authorities. Gov. Gary R. Herbert, a Republican who handily won election in November, is expected to sign the bill.\par \par \uc2 ''Utah is the anti-Arizona,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a group in Washington that favors legislation by Congress to grant legal status to illegal immigrants. ''Instead of indulging the fantasy that you can drive thousands of people out of your state, it combines enforcement with the idea that those who are settled should be brought into the system.''\par \par \uc2 Under one bill approved on Friday, Utah would issue a two-year work permit to illegal immigrants who could prove that they had been living and working in the state. To qualify, immigrants would have to pass a criminal background check and pay fines of up to $2,500.\par \par \uc2 The bill gives the governor until 2013 to negotiate with federal immigration authorities for a waiver for the guest worker program. Under federal law, it is a violation for an employer to knowingly hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . If no waiver has been obtained by then, the guest worker program would go into effect anyway.\par \par \uc2 Under a separate bill, also approved Friday, officers would be required to check the immigration status of anyone they arrest on a felony or serious misdemeanor charge.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers revised that bill to remove terms borrowed from the Arizona law that would have allowed the police to ask immigration questions based on a ''reasonable suspicion'' that a person they stopped was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . That provision, among others, was strongly opposed by Latinos in Arizona, who said it would lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 State Representative Bill Wright, a Republican who was the sponsor of the guest worker bill in the House, said it was intended to be a practical way to deal with illegal immigrants in the state. ''I'm a very conservative Republican; I'm not moderate at all,'' he said. But, he said, ''we literally do not have the ability to remove those who are here illegally.''\par \par \uc2 The enforcement measure was sponsored by State Representative Stephen Sandstrom, a Republican who has been an outspoken proponent of following Arizona's lead on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Many groups in Utah hoped to avoid the expense and furor provoked by Arizona's bill. In November, a range of groups signed a proposal called the Utah Compact, which laid out principles that included respect for the law but also supported a free-market business approach and opposed measures that would separate families by deportation. It was signed by the Salt Lake Chamber, a statewide business group; the Roman Catholic Church; the Salt Lake City Police Department and mayor's office; and local immigration advocate groups.\par \par \uc2 The Mormon Church, which had been cautious on the issue, did not sign the compact but immediately endorsed it.\par \par \uc2 Not everyone in Utah was happy with the new immigration measures. Several hundred protesters from immigrant organizations demonstrated outside the Capitol on Saturday, calling the enforcement bill racist and urging Mr. Herbert to veto it, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.\par \par \uc2 David Leopold, the president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said Utah's bills were ''another ill-advised attempt by a state to regulate immigration.'' He warned that the effort ''dangerously treads into a policy area that is the sole province of the federal government.''\par \par \uc2 The Utah measures, coming from one of the most conservative states in the nation, open an avenue for action for Republican politicians who have been concerned that the strident tone of supporters of Arizona's law -- including Gov. Jan Brewer and Russell Pearce, the Arizona Senate majority leader who wrote the bill -- has alienated Latino voters.\par \par \uc2 Some Republican leaders have argued that to win the presidency in 2012, they need to increase Latino support in states like California, Nevada, New York and Texas. Among others, Newt Gingrich, a potential presidential candidate, and Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, have pressed fellow Republicans to moderate their speech on immigration.\par \par \uc2 ''Utah thought Arizona's law would backfire,'' said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, a Republican group that has been working to draw the party toward an immigration policy with more appeal to Hispanics. ''It was not business-friendly, and it would drive away workers and investment. Utah has provided conservative arguments for passing a different kind of measure.''\par \par \uc2 Arizona's immigration enforcement law drew a boycott by the nation's most prominent Latino organizations and cost the state $86 million in lost convention and tourism business, according to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a group that opposed the measure. Mr. Pearce has proposed a new package of immigration restrictions that go far beyond last year's.\par \par \uc2 Another bill that passed the Utah House and is likely to be approved next week in the Senate would set up a partnership with Nuevo Leon State in Mexico to bring temporary farm workers to Utah through the existing federal guest worker program.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the bills in Utah said they should be a model for action on immigration by Congress. ''It's doable,'' said Wesley Smith, director of public policy for the Salt Lake Chamber. ''The extremes have dominated the immigration debate for so long, it makes it so refreshing to see that a practical solution is possible.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110307e7370003u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As many state legislatures consider laws to expand the role of local police departments in immigration control, police chiefs across the country say they are reluctant to take on these tasks and want clear lines drawn between local crime-fighting and federal immigration enforcement, according to a new report by a police research group.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of police department commanders who participated in the report recommended that local officers should be explicitly prohibited from arresting people solely because of their immigration status, and should have orders to protect victims and witnesses regardless of that status.\par \par \uc2 The report, issued on Thursday by the Police Executive Research Forum, cites worries among police chiefs that if they are pulled into immigration enforcement, a job that was limited until recently to federal agents, their ties to immigrant communities will be eroded, with the result that crimes would not be reported and witnesses would be afraid to cooperate in investigations.\par \par \uc2 While police chiefs have spoken out against efforts to increase their immigration role in cities like Phoenix and Los Angeles, which have been embroiled in debates on the issue, the report makes clear how widespread the concerns are among commanders. Top officers from Salt Lake City, Topeka, Kan., Elgin and Peoria, Ill., Framingham, Mass., and Miami were among the chiefs and sheriffs supporting the recommendations in the report.\par \par \uc2 Arizona has gone furthest among the states to authorize local police departments to participate in an immigration crackdown, with a law passed last April. It ordered officers to question anyone they stopped about immigration status based on a ''reasonable suspicion'' that the person was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The Obama administration sued Arizona over the statute and federal courts have suspended its central provisions.\par \par \uc2 Despite the federal challenge in Arizona, similar bills have been introduced this year in at least 19 state legislatures. They have advanced through some stage of approval in Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina and Nebraska.\par \par \uc2 The Police Executive Research Forum, based in Washington, provides policy research to the chiefs of the country's largest law enforcement agencies. Its report started with recommendations that police chiefs initially made at a meeting in Phoenix in July 2009. The researchers then looked more closely at six cities where police chiefs became embattled because of immigration disputes in their communities.\par \par \uc2 While local police officers generally have not been authorized to enforce federal immigration law, the chiefs recommended that arrests based only on immigration status be prohibited by order. They said departments should reinforce policies that civil rights must be protected regardless of a person's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 The chiefs called on federal immigration authorities to separate out criminal warrants from civil immigration warrants, which are not based on crimes, in law enforcement databases that police routinely use to check backgrounds of people they arrest.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm trying to avoid my police officers getting into the immigration enforcement business,'' J. Thomas Manger, the police chief of Montgomery County, Md., said in an interview Thursday. ''It's counter to my mission,'' said Chief Manger, one of the commanders whose role in an immigration debate was highlighted in the report.\par \par \uc2 He said one of his biggest efforts was to gain the trust of immigrant communities in the county. ''If folks think for one second that if I report I was assaulted, the police will deport me, there will be an increase in unreported crime and people won't testify,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Chief Manger said he would not advocate any policy that would lessen enforcement against immigrants who committed crimes. Montgomery County ''is not a sanctuary jurisdiction by any means,'' he said. ''If there are criminal warrants, we lock them up as quick as we find them.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110304e7340004j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ross Ramsey, the managing editor at The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column.\par \par \uc2 The growth of the state's Hispanic population and the rise of immigration as a political issue puts Texas Republicans in a tight spot.\par \par \uc2 It's clear in the polls, on the political stump, on the news, at rallies and in the aisles of the Legislature that voters strongly support tougher enforcement of immigration laws and that conservative and white voters strongly support more restrictions and fewer benefits for illegal immigrants and their children.\par \par \uc2 It's also clear that Hispanic voters -- part of the fastest-growing group in the state's population -- don't agree with their fellow Texans on many of those issues. Can Republicans keep their current voters happy without alienating the Hispanics they hope will support them in statewide races in the future?\par \par \uc2 This isn't new. When George W. Bush was governor, he was careful with immigration issues. He had watched California Republicans run some tough-nosed campaigns on immigration that resulted in a backlash that helped the Democrats take over their state government. Mr. Bush also wanted to bring Hispanics into the Republican Party, to win their votes and to unravel the historical ties between those voters and Texas Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Bill Hammond, a former Republican legislator who now heads the Texas Association of Business, thinks immigrant-bashing legislation could undermine the G.O.P., making Hispanics feel unwelcome and hurting businesses at the same time. ''I think you suffer in the short term as well as the long term,'' Mr. Hammond said.\par \par \uc2 When Gov. Rick Perry talks about immigration, he doesn't talk about immigration. He talks about border security and other law enforcement-related subjects like sanctuary cities. He's not anti-immigration, just pro-law enforcement. Mexico's drug gangs haven't hurt the argument for border security, either: Mr. Perry's ads on the subject in 2006 were so effective that he used them again in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Now the climate has changed, visible in the makeup of the Legislature. Republicans have 101 seats in the 150-member House, and 19 in the 31-member Senate. The clarity of what G.O.P. voters want is reflected in the bills filed by their elected officials. They're talking about taking in-state college tuition away from the children of illegal immigrants who live in Texas. They've proposed Arizona-style legislation to make local police the enforcers of federal laws. They're calling on the federal government, meanwhile, to enforce those laws and to -- this is Mr. Perry again -- send more people to patrol the border in the interest of safety. They've renewed calls to crack down on businesses that hire illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Perry added sanctuary cities to his list of ''emergency'' legislation that can be considered by the Legislature during what is normally a law-passing blackout for the first 60 days of the session. But he has been careful with it, saying he doesn't want to require local police to enforce federal immigration laws, as Arizona does. He wants to outlaw bans on that practice, and says simply that local police should be allowed to enforce those laws as they wish. No requirement, no ban, no bashing -- just law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 His sanctuary-cities ban is a product of the governor's race in November and illustrates how he has walked the political line. In that contest, Mr. Perry accused his Democratic opponent, Bill White, of running a sanctuary city as mayor of Houston, preventing the police from enforcing immigration laws. And Mr. Perry closed his campaign with an ad featuring a Houston police officer whose husband, also an officer, was shot to death by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  during an arrest.\par \par \uc2 With the Legislature in town, it's harder to modulate the responses to public calls for tougher enforcement. If you're a governor or a lawmaker who wants to be governor some day, all of that raises the political question above: Is it possible to keep lawmakers from doing something that will sink the party in the future? And is it possible to escape this legislative session with a package of bills moderate enough to keep Hispanic voters in the fold without forfeiting the 2012 primary elections to current Republicans, including the noisy Tea Partyers, who want a stronger hand?\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think this is the kind of issue that defeats you in a Republican primary,'' Mr. Hammond said. ''You have to be atrocious to get defeated in a Republican primary. Taxes might fall into atrocious activity, but I don't think this does.''\par \par \uc2 rramsey@texastribune.org\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110227e72r00080\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 ''Dreaming of Having an American Life in Full,'' by Michael Winerip (On Education column, Feb. 21), tells only one side of the story.\par \par \uc2 I am sympathetic to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children like Isabel Castillo who were brought here by their parents. Because their parents disregarded America's immigration laws, they are in a difficult position. But by granting citizenship, the United States would actually reward their \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents, who knowingly violated our laws. It would perpetuate the problem the bill claims to solve.\par \par \uc2 It would also penalize the children of American citizens and those who immigrated here legally.\par \par \uc2 Once they become citizens, illegal immigrants could petition for their parents to be legalized; the parents could then bring in others in an endless chain.\par \par \uc2 If the United States grants amnesty to those who were brought to the United States illegally by their parents without first enforcing our immigration laws, we will undoubtedly have to deal with this problem again in the future.\par \par \uc2 The American people want Congress to focus on creating jobs and getting Americans back to work. Currently, an estimated eight million illegal immigrants hold American jobs. Amnesty will give illegal immigrants a legal right to those jobs and encourage more illegal immigrants who are hoping for yet another round of amnesty. That's not fair to children of American citizens and legal residents, who have a right to those already scarce American jobs.\par \par \uc2 Elton Gallegly\par \par \uc2 Washington, Feb. 24, 2011\par \par \uc2 The writer, a California Republican, is chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110226e72q0001x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- Arizona lawmakers are proposing a sweeping package of immigration restrictions that might make the controversial measures the state approved last year, which the Obama administration went to court to block, look mild.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would be barred from driving in the state, enrolling in school or receiving most public benefits. Their children would receive special birth certificates that would make clear that the state does not consider them Arizona citizens.\par \par \uc2 Some of the bills, like those restricting immigrants' access to schooling and right to state citizenship, flout current federal law and are being put forward to draw legal challenges in hopes that the Supreme Court might rule in the state's favor.\par \par \uc2 Arizona drew considerable scorn last year when it passed legislation compelling police officers to inquire about the immigration status of those they stopped whom they suspected were in the country illegally. Critics said the law would lead to racial profiling of Latinos, and a federal judge agreed that portions of the law, known as Senate Bill 1070, were unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 Similar legal challenges are likely to come in response to the latest round of legislation, some of which cleared a key Senate committee early Wednesday after a long debate that drew hundreds of protesters, some for and some against the crackdown.\par \par \uc2 ''This bill is miles beyond S.B. 1070 in terms of its potential to roll back the rights and fundamental freedoms of both citizens and noncitizens alike,'' said Alessandra Soler Meetze, executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Arizona. She said the measures would create ''a 'papers, please' society'' and that a new crime -- ''driving while undocumented'' -- would be added to the books.\par \par \uc2 Despite boycotts and accusations that the state has become a haven of intolerance, Arizona won plaudits last year from immigration hardliners across the country. On Tuesday night, the Indiana Senate voted to allow its police officers to question people stopped for infractions on their immigration status, one of numerous proposals inspired by Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 ''If you are ever going to stop this invasion, and it is an invasion, you have to quit rewarding people for breaking those laws,'' said State Senator Russell Pearce, the Senate president, who is leading Arizona's effort to try to make life so difficult for illegal immigrants that they stop coming, or leave.\par \par \uc2 Opponents said the changes were a drastic rewriting of the core values of the country. In Tucson, a community group was so enraged by what it called the extremist nature of the proposals from Phoenix that it proposed severing the state in two, creating what some call Baja Arizona.\par \par \uc2 ''Denying citizenship to children because they have parents without documents is crazy,'' said the Rev. Javier Perez, a Roman Catholic priest and immigrant from Mexico who waited in the legislative chamber into the night Tuesday for a chance to speak. ''Honestly, I don't think anything I say will change their minds, but it's immoral what they're doing and we have to say this is against the values of America.''\par \par \uc2 The measures would compel school officials to ask for proof of citizenship for students and require hospitals to similarly ask for papers for those receiving non-emergency care. Illegal immigrants would be blocked from obtaining any state licenses, including those for marriage. Landlords would be forced to evict the entire family from public housing if one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  were found living in a unit. Illegal immigrants found driving would face 30 days in jail and forfeit the vehicle to the state.\par \par \uc2 The measures are not assured of passage. Although Republicans have a majority in the Legislature, the restrictions on citizenship failed to win approval in the Judiciary Committee this month, so they were rerouted to the Appropriations Committee, where they won passage.\par \par \uc2 Some state lawmakers said their constituents were furious over the Obama administration's lawsuit challenging the last immigration law and wanted the state to continue pressing the issue. Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, said the state would file a countersuit against the federal government accusing it of not enforcing immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the crackdown include Katie Dionne, who described herself as an ''average, everyday American'' who wanted to prevent illegal immigrants from changing her way of life. ''If their life is so wonderful why did they leave where they're from?'' she asked senators.\par \par \uc2 Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security and a former Arizona governor, cites statistics showing that the influx of illegal immigrants across the Arizona border has declined markedly with significant increases in federal resources. But that has done little to ameliorate the feeling of crisis expressed by many Arizona politicians.\par \par \uc2 The state's business community, stung by a boycott that has reduced the number of conventions in the state, generally opposes the new round of restrictions. ''This will put Arizona through another trial and hurt innocent businesspeople who are just trying to get ahead,'' said Glenn Hamer of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO; State Senator Russell Pearce, the Senate President, said, ''If you are ever going to stop this invasion, and it is an invasion, you have to quit rewarding people for breaking those laws.''

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A Honduran teenager gained fame as the star of a documentary film that showed the dangers faced by children who ride across Mexico atop freight trains to cross illegally to the United States. But the boy, Kevin Casasola, rode the trains again, and now he has been granted asylum in the United States, his lawyer said on Monday.\par \par \uc2 The documentary, ''Which Way Home,'' directed by Rebecca Cammisa, won an Emmy award for HBO last year and was nominated for an Oscar. Ms. Cammisa took her cameras onto the lurching trains, filming a cohort of children riding north as they dodged tunnels, trees and criminal predators, fighting loneliness and hunger. It tells of several children who died or disappeared along the way.\par \par \uc2 Kevin, who was 14 in the film, was its most appealing protagonist, with his daring clowning on freight car roofs and his determination to make it to the United States to find work so he could send money back to his mother. During the filming he was detained by American border agents and deported to Honduras. The documentary showed the desolation and need that drove him to leave his home village in the first place.\par \par \uc2 The documentary drew an outpouring of concern for the children to its \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page. Some Americans offered to adopt Kevin, although his mother figured prominently in the film and in his motives for riding the trains.\par \par \uc2 In Mexico, the impact was even greater, and Kevin became something of a legend. Ms. Cammisa sent the film to rural villages as a warning to restless teenagers that they should not attempt a similar trip. The country's first lady, Margarita Zavala, helped distribute it, and during a state visit to Washington last May, she said that Mexican babies were being named Kevin as a result of its popularity.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Cammisa said she tried to persuade Kevin to stay in Honduras, using donations raised by the film to pay for him to take a course in mobile phone repair.\par \par \uc2 But last July, she said in an interview, Kevin called her from a detention center in California. After a two-month journey on the trains, he had crossed the border and was doing farm work near El Centro. He had been arrested by the local police, who suspected he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Contacted by Ms. Cammisa, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a private charity, found a volunteer lawyer, Raed Gonzalez of Houston. An asylum petition he presented for Kevin was granted by an immigration judge in January.\par \par \uc2 Since asylum proceedings are confidential, Mr. Gonzalez said he could not reveal the threat that was the basis for Kevin's claim that he could not safely return to Honduras. The film provides a possible clue, showing a violent stepfather who spoke bluntly of his loathing for the boy.\par \par \uc2 Kevin, now 17, is in a shelter for minors in Houston, Mr. Gonzalez said, happy to be living legally in the United States. He is studying English and will go back to school, and eventually he will be placed in foster care. He has had a haircut, Mr. Gonzalez said, newly mindful of his image. Shelter authorities declined to allow him to be interviewed.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol figures show that agents detained about 18,000 unaccompanied children crossing illegally into the United States in 2009. Most were sent back. Mr. Gonzalez said successful asylum claims like Kevin Casasola's were rare.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Cammisa said that Kevin's story showed the magnetic lure of the United States for many Mexican and Central American children. ''Kevin was raised with an inner dialogue about coming to the U.S.,'' she said. ''His mother urged him to help his family.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: At 14, Kevin Casasola, left, was featured with other Central American children in ''Which Way Home,'' an HBO documentary.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTMB\par {\*\bkmkstart toc72}{\*\bkmkend toc72}\b \uc2 It Ended In a Suitcase\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALAN FEUER; Jack Begg and Karen Zraick contributed reporting.   \par \uc2 2,958 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 February 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 THE 17-second video, assembled from security cameras in Harlem, showed what seemed to be an ordinary man, in a cap and a leather jacket, walking down the street with an ordinary suitcase. Neither, however, was ordinary, the authorities said. The man, they claimed, was a murderer; the suitcase held the body of a woman he had killed.\par \par \uc2 It was one of those uniquely gruesome crimes that seemed devised expressly for the tabloids, and the expected headlines (''Body-Dump Fiend!'' ''Horror in Harlem!'') quickly appeared. The articles beneath them dwelt on grisly details -- a presumed sexual encounter, a frying pan, an electrical cord -- and on the sordidness of the characters: Betty Williams, 28, a strung-out prostitute who had been to Rikers Island several times, and Hassan Malik, 55, a Navy veteran with a long criminal history of his own.\par \par \uc2 Then, within days, the whole thing disappeared from public view, chalked up -- if to anything at all -- to a streetwalker's fate, or to a criminal's devolution or to mere bad luck. Questions lingered: How had these two met? Why had things turned violent? And, most important, how, in 21st-century New York, was it possible for a strangled woman to be stuffed inside a suitcase and summarily deposited on the street?\par \par \uc2 Perhaps that last question is unanswerable, but there are subtle clues in the public record that indicate that Mr. Malik -- who contacted the police on Christmas Day, three days after the suitcase was found -- was a violent drifter with a history of beating up women. Dark hints also emerged, in extensive interviews with Ms. Williams's family, of her past as the daughter of drug addicts, as a young woman who had been married to an addict and as a mother who had abandoned her only child at birth. These details, these characters, were in some sense even more troubling than the original portraits.\par \par \uc2 At Ms. Williams's funeral, on Jan. 6 in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, a chaplain, Robert D. Rice, posed the common questions. ''When death is sudden and unexpected, the question most of the time is, 'Why?' '' he said. '' 'Why this?' This question is most often asked, and most often left unanswered, when sudden death occurs. 'Why?' ''\par \par \uc2 ON March 10, 2001, a young couple were married at City Hall.\par \par \uc2 The bride, Ms. Williams, was 19 at the time, and wore for the occasion a rhinestone tiara, a pale yellow dress and matching high heels. The groom, Eduardo Rodriguez, was a 30-year-old Dominican of dapper style but limited means.\par \par \uc2 The wedding was a modest one, attended only by the couple, the bride's paternal aunt and the aunt's three children, two of whom were flower girls. After the ceremony, there was lunch at TGI Fridays on 34th Street, near Pennsylvania Station.\par \par \uc2 ''Everyone was looking at her,'' the aunt, Carmen Perez, proudly recalled. Ms. Perez had made the tiara. She had also made the bride's corsage and had decorated a special wedding glass, which was put to use later for Champagne toasts.\par \par \uc2 The bride's mother, Lorez Williams, did not attend. She was in prison again, serving a drug sentence of two and a half years at the Albion Correctional Facility in upstate New York. The bride's father, Rafael Perez, was not there, either. This was not unusual for Mr. Perez, who was described by his eldest daughter, Yajaira Springer, as ''a guy who was almost a baseball player but got caught up in that Washington Heights-era drug thing.''\par \par \uc2 When lunch was over, everyone returned to Carmen Perez's house in the Bronx, which was like a second home to Ms. Williams. She had been raised in New York and in the Dominican Republic by her aunt. Her own home was troubled, to say the least. Before Betty was born, her sister Yajaira, then an infant, had been placed in foster care after a fire broke out while she was home alone. (Ms. Springer said her mother had been out buying drugs.) Fearful of something similar happening to Betty, Ms. Perez arranged for her to move, at the age of 18 months, to Santo Domingo, where she lived with her father's family for about a decade.\par \par \uc2 ''We didn't want her to be lost,'' Ms. Perez said.\par \par \uc2 Even as a child, Ms. Williams was headstrong and spontaneous and enjoyed life's luxuries -- she was partial to Chanel, designer jeans and $100 sneakers, her family said. She concluded early on that life in the Dominican Republic was not for her. Though her English was poor, she wanted to return to New York and ''her original roots,'' her sister said. Her father's family reluctantly conceded. ''I know now, if they could take that back,'' Ms. Springer said, ''they would.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Williams went to junior high school and then John F. Kennedy High School in the Bronx, but she did not do well. ''People used to make fun of her,'' said Josephine Banguela, a cousin. ''She didn't get math and didn't speak English well.''\par \par \uc2 Betty quit school at 18; no one tried to stop her. ''When she saw that freedom,'' said Norma Fuentes, an old family friend, ''she just ran wild.''\par \par \uc2 Falling back in with her mother, Ms. Williams also fell into drugs, her sister said.\par \par \uc2 ''She used to make Betty knock on drug dealers' doors and flirt with them, and then my mother would rob the dealers,'' Ms. Springer said. ''Betty had a shape on her and my mother sent her all over the Bronx -- it was a sad thing.'' Their father sometimes took part in the robberies, too, Ms. Springer said; the three of them smoked crack together. (Mr. Perez, who lives in the Bronx, could not be reached for comment. His family said he frequently changed his phone number.)\par \par \uc2 It was around this time, in early 2000, that Ms. Williams met her future husband at a nightclub in Harlem. ''She loved to dance,'' said her cousin, Ms. Banguela, and Mr. Rodriguez -- fit, clean, sharply dressed -- was a dancer. He was also an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Ms. Springer said; they married, in part, so he could remain in the United States.\par \par \uc2 They found an apartment in Upper Manhattan, and Ms. Williams seemed happy for a while, her family said. But within nine months, it became apparent that Mr. Rodriguez, who had no visible income, was addicted to drugs. He wasted money and stopped paying rent. One night, Ms. Perez recalled, Ms. Williams hit him with a broomstick for smoking crack in their bathroom. She was ''against drugs,'' Ms. Perez said, but Mr. Rodriguez encouraged her to smoke crack with him. As Ms. Springer put it, ''Her husband had her strung out full time.''\par \par \uc2 A year after taking the apartment, they were thrown out and landed at a homeless shelter near Central Park.\par \par \uc2 It was there, in 2005, that Ms. Williams learned she was pregnant. The same year, her husband was arrested on a drug charge and was deported to the Dominican Republic. Growing ''distant,'' Ms. Williams stopped visiting the family, Ms. Perez said.\par \par \uc2 Eduardo Jr. was born at Harlem Hospital in 2006; the child was fine, but Ms. Williams suffered seizures during the delivery.\par \par \uc2 She was unconscious for nearly a week, and when she awoke, the city had taken custody of the baby. Her aunt said Ms. Williams tried to get the baby back, then quit. Her sister's story was harsher.\par \par \uc2 ''She just walked out and left him there,'' Ms. Springer said. ''It comes from lack of love.''\par \par \uc2 LATE one night in 1992 -- when Betty Williams was 10 -- the police responded to a ''domestic'' at the Valley Oaks apartments in Atlanta. Hassan Malik, 37, lived in Unit A with his girlfriend, Sherri Tutt. The officers took Mr. Malik into custody. Five months later, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to two days in jail. His case file carried a warning: ''No violent contact with Sherri Tutt.''\par \par \uc2 Born on Long Island, Mr. Malik was one of nine children -- five boys and four girls -- with the same father, but different mothers. His name then, throughout Roosevelt High School and a brief stint in the Navy, was Gregory Murray. It is unclear when and why he changed it.\par \par \uc2 His military career was undistinguished: he served from February 1973 to April 1974, mainly on the aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt, where, as an apprentice, he worked maintaining aircraft and was trained, federal records show, for ''race relations'' and ''oxygen canister disposal.'' After his discharge, he went to college at North Carolina State University and obtained a degree from the now-defunct and unaccredited Atlanta School of Law.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Malik has pleaded not guilty to a charge of second-degree murder, saying he acted in self-defense. He declined, from his cell on Rikers Island, to be interviewed, as did several family members. Ms. Tutt's mother, Brenda Moore, said only that she felt badly for Mr. Malik, who had given her a grandchild.\par \par \uc2 The altercation with Ms. Tutt was neither the first nor the last time Mr. Malik had trouble with the law. In 1988, he was arrested on a charge of credit card fraud; in 1994, he was convicted of forgery.\par \par \uc2 Before he served his two-year term in federal prison for the forgery, Mr. Malik separated from his wife; defaulted on a $15,000 student loan; was arrested several times on charges of passing bad checks (one resulting in a lawsuit against him by the E-Z Check Cashing Corporation of Atlanta); and was sued by a towing company that said he had abandoned his car on the street.\par \par \uc2 After he got out of prison, in 1997, he was arrested within months, this time in the Bronx, and pleaded guilty to assaulting a former girlfriend, Semeera Estelle. Before a sentence was rendered, he was charged again: with harassing Ms. Estelle at her job at a school in Westchester County. After she refused to drive him to a bank to cash his paycheck, according to police reports, he stalked her at work and later called her and said: ''You're messing with my life. I'm going to kill you.''\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Ms. Estelle told the police, ''I am fearful of my life.'' Mr. Malik pleaded guilty to aggravated harassment and was sentenced to time served.\par \par \uc2 Five years later, court papers show, he attacked another girlfriend, Phyllis Runyon, at their apartment in Tacoma, Wash. In May 2002, she had thrown him out. Five weeks later, he returned with a spare key, ''but the door was blocked with a chair,'' Ms. Runyon wrote in her request for an order of protection. ''He then proceeded to push through the chair, breaking the door off the panel, came in and attacked me using a dinette chair.'' She was hospitalized. Asked if drugs were involved in the attack, she wrote: ''crack/cocaine.''\par \par \uc2 At that point, Mr. Malik was 47 and without a permanent home. Real estate records show a pattern of itinerancy: an apartment in Tallahassee, Fla.; a house in Durham, N.C.; the Valley Oaks apartments in Atlanta; a veterans' hospital in Virginia; addresses in Washington, Philadelphia, Westchester, Manhattan and the Bronx.\par \par \uc2 Tanya Murray, a niece in Georgia, said in a brief interview that her side of the family had not spoken with Mr. Malik in years. When told he had been charged with murder, she sighed.\par \par \uc2 ''It is what it is,'' Ms. Murray said.\par \par \uc2 AFTER Ms. Williams abandoned her child, she descended into crime. In 2006, she was jailed twice for criminal possession of a controlled substance. In 2007, she was jailed three times, for drug charges and criminal trespass. In 2008, seven times. She went to jail once in 2009 and, last year, served a final sentence for theft of services in the Bronx.\par \par \uc2 ''The last time I spoke to her, a year ago, she called from Rikers Island,'' Ms. Banguela said. ''She said: 'I'm so fat. I want to come back to the family. I want to change.' ''\par \par \uc2 Instead, Ms. Williams moved back in with her mother, in the Bronx, and spent days getting high and watching action programs on TV. ''She was on the crack,'' her mother, Lorez Williams, said. ''She resembled me when I used to be young.''\par \par \uc2 Last spring, the younger woman found a new apartment, on East 111th Street. It was around the corner from an hourly rate hotel, the New Ebony, which offers condoms to its patrons from a glass bowl at the reception desk. On the streets, she called herself Jackie.\par \par \uc2 People in the neighborhood recalled her wandering around, stoned, and taking men to the hotel. ''The day before she got herself killed,'' said Miguel Gandarilla, who works at a deli across the street from the hotel, ''I told Jackie: 'Take it easy. You better calm down.' She said, 'Shut up.' ''\par \par \uc2 Yajaira Springer's foster sister, Jaqueline, lived not far from the New Ebony. She had met Ms. Williams a few times, and though they were not related, considered her a sister. She remembers seeing a woman in her neighborhood -- a sad creature, clearly hooked on drugs and often in the company of shady-looking men. ''I seen her,'' Jaqueline Springer said, ''but I didn't know who she was.''\par \par \uc2 When the video clip of the man and the suitcase was released, word went around the neighborhood that the woman stuffed inside was Jackie. Soon, the family discovered that Jackie was, in fact, Betty Williams.\par \par \uc2 ''She was right down the street,'' Jaqueline Springer said, weeping at the funeral. ''Right down the street, and I never even knew.''\par \par \uc2 AT 2:18 p.m. on Christmas Day, a man called the 23rd Precinct station house in Harlem. ''I'm the one dragging the bag,'' he said. ''I'm scared. I'm not trying to run from you guys. I promise I'll call back.''\par \par \uc2 Eight hours later, he did, telling a detective: ''I'm still in the city. My name is Malik and I need help.''\par \par \uc2 He was arrested two days later in Tarrytown, N.Y. While being driven to the station house in Harlem, he told his captors he had a master's degree and then, according to court records, asked, cryptically, ''What's the difference between manslaughter and murder?''\par \par \uc2 Within two hours, he had confessed to killing Betty Williams.\par \par \uc2 On Dec. 18, he said, a friend introduced him to a woman named Jackie at his apartment, which was a few blocks from the New Ebony Hotel. Mr. Malik said Jackie had asked if, on occasion, she could bring men to the apartment for sex. ''I said it would be all right,'' Mr. Malik wrote in a confession, ''but I would have to get paid.'' They agreed on a price: $35 an hour.\par \par \uc2 At 2 a.m. on Dec. 21, Jackie showed up at the apartment with a drug dealer named Eric, according to the confession. Eric sold her crack then left, Mr. Malik said, and Jackie went to the living room, apparently to get high. Mr. Malik took a Seroquel -- a drug sold on the street as a sedative -- then fell asleep, he said, in the bedroom.\par \par \uc2 ''Next thing I know, it's morning and Jackie is hitting me with the bottom of a large metal cast-iron frying pan,'' he wrote. He said she was screaming, ''Where's the money at?'' and threatened to have him killed. There was a struggle. Mr. Malik, 6-foot-1 and 195 pounds, got hold of the pan. He clubbed Ms. Williams twice in the head, he wrote, but she continued fighting. She grabbed the cord to his VCR, he said, and wound it around his neck. But again he disarmed her and choked her with the cord, he said, until she lay, not moving, on the floor.\par \par \uc2 ''I assumed she was dead,'' he wrote, ''so I closed the door and called my friend Richard Martin.'' Mr. Martin turned up 20 minutes later and, upon seeing the body, went back out for supplies: gloves, bleach, ammonia, garbage bags and a large black suitcase, Mr. Malik said. ''I put Jackie's body in the suitcase,'' he wrote. ''I put her in a garbage bag from the waist up so that blood didn't leak through the suitcase.''\par \par \uc2 He waited until 11:30 p.m., then wheeled the suitcase out of his building, up First Avenue and down 114th Street. ''I was sweating a lot and my hip was hurting, so I stopped by a stoop in the middle of the block,'' he wrote. ''Finally, I decided to leave the suitcase by some garbage cans, under a scaffold.''\par \par \uc2 A few minutes later, a homeless man rooting through the cans opened the suitcase and a leg popped out.\par \par \uc2 He called the police.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: TORTURED LIFE: Lorez Williams, below, grieved at the funeral of her daughter Betty Williams, 28, whose body was found stuffed in a piece of luggage in December.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 FALLS CHURCH, Va. -- When Mohamed Mejri, a Tunisian immigrant with a limousine business here, first learned that the State Department of Motor Vehicles had refused to issue him a new driver's license, he thought it was a mistake. After all, he had been a licensed driver in Virginia for years.\par \par \uc2 But last fall, the department stopped accepting his federally issued work permit, a document that was his main proof that he was in the country legally, because he does not have a green card.\par \par \uc2 Now, five months later, his business is collapsing, and bill collectors are calling.\par \par \uc2 Virginia changed its policy in September after an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Bolivia was charged with hitting and killing a nun while driving drunk in Prince William County.\par \par \uc2 Her death hardened what was already a strong anti-immigrant mood in the state. Virginia's governor, Bob McDonnell, announced that work permits would no longer be accepted as proof of legal residence because they could be held by people who, like the Bolivian immigrant, are in deportation proceedings. The governor said other documents would still be accepted.\par \par \uc2 The permit, called the employment authorization document, allows foreign nationals to work in the United States. Asylum seekers, refugees and students are among those who have one.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Mejri, who is 54, the permit is all he has. He fled Tunisia in 1992, and after living in Canada, where he had been granted political asylum, he came to the United States in 2000. American immigration authorities rejected his application for asylum, over an unpaid fine in Canada. By the time it was paid and processed, several years had passed, and he received notice that it was too late to reapply. He then received an administrative order to leave the country, but a federal judge ruled in his favor that he not be deported. Now he is in limbo, in the country legally but without any path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Melanie Stokes, a spokeswoman for Virginia's Department of Motor Vehicles, said she could not comment on Mr. Mejri's status because state law prevented her from discussing individual cases.\par \par \uc2 The precise number of people affected by the change is unknown. Jorge Figueredo of the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia said he was personally handling 38 cases, and estimated that the total number of stranded immigrants could be in the hundreds.\par \par \uc2 The authorities said the numbers were much smaller. In a letter to a group of lawyers and immigrant advocacy organizations in January, the commissioner of motor vehicles, Richard D. Holcomb, said that in the 11 weeks after the policy was implemented, about 4,000 applicants entered an ''elevated review process,'' a reference to people who used to rely on the employment card. Of those, only 819 did not immediately get a license, the letter said.\par \par \uc2 By early December, more than 60 percent of those people had received a license using other documents, he wrote, and an additional 3 percent were rejected, mostly because they were in deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Figueredo, the state A.C.L.U.'s director of racial justice and immigrants' rights, said he was not satisfied with the response, adding that the letter did not explain what became of the more than 200 applicants who were neither rejected outright nor given licenses.\par \par \uc2 ''What about the rest?'' he said in his small office in Falls Church last week. A plea for help from a Kenyan man dropped into his e-mail inbox during the interview.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Stokes reiterated that only 3 percent had been rejected and said that the others had not returned to obtain a license by the time the records were checked in December. She said the department had no way of knowing what happened to them.\par \par \uc2 ''We can only surmise that they moved to another state or decided not to get a credential,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Mejri was first refused a new license, he went to five other Department of Motor Vehicles offices, hoping his documents would be accepted.\par \par \uc2 At one, a clerk requested the original court order granting his petition against deportation. It took eight weeks, but he produced it. A copy was faxed to Richmond, but it had no effect. He was never rejected outright, he said, and was asked repeatedly for additional proof of legal residence.\par \par \uc2 ''This should not be happening,'' Mr. Figueredo said. ''This man is legally present. He has a decision by a federal judge. Why isn't that good enough?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mejri soon fell behind on his bills, and his insurance company canceled his liability coverage. That triggered the cancellation of his business license. Meanwhile, credit card companies continued to charge him for use of their services for his cars, souring his credit rating.\par \par \uc2 He felt particularly helpless when he discovered that he could not even buy the syringes he needed to treat his diabetes without presenting a valid driver's license and had to work through a social worker to get them.\par \par \uc2 ''I am demoralized,'' Mr. Mejri said, tears rolling under his glasses onto his sweater. ''I see no door open in front of me. Nobody wants to listen.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Stokes said there was a special center in Richmond to review such claims that could contact federal immigration authorities directly to ascertain an applicant's status.\par \par \uc2 She could not say whether this had been done in Mr. Mejri's case. She said there was a clearly defined list of documents, posted online, that are accepted. She said she did not know the number of applicants who failed to get licenses since December.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Figueredo said that clerks have not been consistent in accepting certain alternative documents.\par \par \uc2 Some immigrants have had success presenting a document called an I-797, essentially a receipt for a visa application, but others have not. To address that problem, a bill was presented in Virginia's House in January that would have required the department to spell out its procedure, Mr. Figueredo said, but it did not pass.\par \par \uc2 A month ago, Mr. Mejri rented a room in Rockville, Md., and got a driver's license in that state. But his monthly insurance payments have tripled, and for now, he has put his business aside. He lives off money he has borrowed from his friend Aziz Balaid, an American citizen, who is finding it more difficult to be optimistic about his friend's prospects.\par \par \uc2 ''When he says, 'What am I going to do?' I have no answer for him,'' Mr. Balaid said.\par \par \uc2 Online Correction: February 17, 2011, Thursday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the role of Jorge Figueredo in the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia. He is the organization's director of racial justice and immigrants' rights, not a lawyer.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: With all his troubles, Mohamed Mejri has had to put his limousine business aside.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The man convicted of killing Chandra Levy -- a 24-year-old government intern whose relationship with Gary A. Condit, a California congressman, made the murder case a national news sensation -- was sentenced Friday to 60 years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Judge Gerald I. Fisher of District of Columbia Superior Court chose not to impose the harshest sentence available, life in prison, on the defendant, Ingmar Guandique, 29, who was convicted in November of Ms. Levy's murder. Ms. Levy disappeared in 2001, and her remains were found in Rock Creek Park here a year later.\par \par \uc2 The judge said he believed that Mr. Guandique was dangerous to society, particularly to women, and sentenced him to 60 years, double the minimum required.\par \par \uc2 ''I think he is essentially a sexual predator,'' Judge Fisher said. ''The question is whether I conclude that he's the worst of all the worst. I come close to that conclusion, but I don't quite reach it.''\par \par \uc2 The case became one of the highest-profile unsolved murders in this city's history, in part because it involved Mr. Condit, a Democrat representing California's 18th Congressional District. Investigators later concluded that Mr. Condit, who was married at the time of Ms. Levy's disappearance in May 2001, had not played any role in her murder, but the negative publicity ended his political career.\par \par \uc2 It was eventually categorized as a cold case with no leads. But in 2009, investigators charged Mr. Guandique, who was serving time for attacks on other women that had occurred in the same park around the time Ms. Levy disappeared.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors faced a challenge in convincing a jury that he was guilty. They had neither witnesses, nor any DNA evidence linking Mr. Guandique to the crime. At the trial, they relied on an inmate who had served time with Mr. Guandique. The inmate, who defense lawyers said was unreliable, testified that Mr. Guandique had confessed to killing Ms. Levy.\par \par \uc2 On Nov. 22, a jury convicted Mr. Guandique of first-degree murder, a decision that Mr. Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, continued to dispute during his sentencing on Friday.\par \par \uc2 ''I am very sorry for what happened to your daughter,'' he said in Spanish to Susan Levy, Ms. Levy's mother. ''But I had nothing to do with it. I am innocent.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Levy read her own statement before Judge Fisher issued the sentence, calling Mr. Guandique a ''hideous creature,'' and telling him he was ''lower than a cockroach.'' Her husband, she said, was a Holocaust survivor, and had been forced to relive the suffering of that experience as a result of Mr. Guandique's actions. In a final expression of contempt, she ended her speech with an expletive.\par \par \uc2 During her remarks, she confronted him over the murder.\par \par \uc2 ''I ask you that right now, did you really take her?'' she said. ''Look into my eyes right now and tell me.''\par \par \uc2 Again, Mr. Guandique protested, silently shaking his head no in response. He has 30 days to file an appeal, Judge Fisher said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Guandique will be eligible for time off from his 60-year sentence if he maintains a clean record of behavior in prison. At most, he could reduce his sentence by about 15 percent, according to the Bureau of Prisons.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Ingmar Guandique insisted he did not kill Chandra Levy.

All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 A 37-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was under arrest Friday after three people were found shot to death and three others were wounded at two houses just blocks apart in the northern Virginia city of Manassas, the police said.\par \par \uc2 The victims in the shooting on Thursday night included several members of the same family, but said Chief Douglas W. Keen of the Manassas Police Department said it was not clear how, or if, the victims knew the suspect, Jose Oswaldo Reyes Alfaro, 37.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Alfaro, 37, from El Salvador, had been ordered deported by a federal judge in 2002, but apparently never left the country, the authorities said.\par \par \uc2 Officers responding Thursday evening to a report of shots fired found the body of Brenda Ashcraft, 56, in the front yard of her house on Hood Road, Chief Keen said.\par \par \uc2 Inside, the police found three other family members who had been shot.\par \par \uc2 William Ashbey Ashcraft, 37, died of a bullet wound on the way to the hospital, the police said. A 34-year-old woman and a 15-year-old girl were wounded; the woman is in a hospital in stable condition, and the girl was treated and released. Their names were not released.\par \par \uc2 About 30 minutes later, Chief Keen said, officers responding to another call of shots fired, on Brent Street, about a quarter-mile away, found the body of Julio Cesar Ulloa, 48.\par \par \uc2 A 77-year-old woman with head wounds -- possibly from a stabbing -- was also inside the house, the police said. She was hospitalized in stable condition; her name was not released.\par \par \uc2 About 45 minutes after the first call to police, Mr. Alfaro was arrested while driving nearby. Chief Keen said some of the victims had described the suspect and his car to the police.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110212e72c0001i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc76}{\*\bkmkend toc76}\b \uc2 After False Dawn, Anxiety for Students Who Are Illegal Immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON   \par \uc2 1,339 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 February 2011\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MILWAUKEE -- It was exhilarating for Maricela Aguilar to stand on the steps of the federal courthouse here one day last summer and reveal for the first time in public that she is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''It's all about losing that shame of who you are,'' Ms. Aguilar, a college student who was born in Mexico but has lived in the United States without legal documents since she was 3 years old, said of her ''coming out'' at a rally in June.\par \par \uc2 Those were heady times for thousands of immigrant students who declared their illegal status during a nationwide campaign for a bill in Congress that would have put them on a path to legal residence. In December that bill, known as the Dream Act, passed the House, then failed in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 President Obama insisted in his State of the Union address and in interviews that he wanted to try again on the bill this year. But with Republicans who vehemently oppose the legislation holding crucial committee positions in the new House, even optimists like Ms. Aguilar believe its chances are poor to none in the next two years.\par \par \uc2 That leaves students like her who might have benefited from the bill -- an estimated 1.2 million nationwide -- in a legal twilight.\par \par \uc2 The president says he supports their cause, and immigration officials say \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students with no criminal record are not among their priorities for deportation. But federal immigration authorities removed a record number of immigrants from the country last year, nearly 393,000, while the local police are rapidly expanding their role in immigration enforcement. Students often get caught.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants also face new restrictions many states are imposing on their access to public education, driver's licenses and jobs. And for those like Ms. Aguilar who came out last year to proclaim their illegal status, there is no going back to the shadows.\par \par \uc2 Republicans who will lead their party in the House on immigration issues say \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students should not be spared from deportation. Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, led the opposition to the Dream Act, calling it ''an American nightmare'' that would allow illegal immigrants to displace American students from public colleges.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith and other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have pledged to block any legislation giving legal status to illegal immigrants, which they reject as amnesty for lawbreakers. Still, as Politico first reported on Monday, Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Democrat, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican, have begun preliminary talks to see whether there is enough support in Congress to try to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul in coming months.\par \par \uc2 In the weeks since the Senate vote, many young illegal immigrants are grappling with the letdown after a campaign that mobilized thousands of them for sit-in protests and text message blitzes of Congressional lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 ''Many have become extremely frustrated, sad, confused and without a lot of answers as to how to move forward,'' said Roberto G. Gonzales, a sociologist at the University of Washington who has surveyed young illegal immigrants. ''They had a lot of hope that their activities were going to change the minds of the country. Having the door slammed in their face hit many of them really hard.''\par \par \uc2 A moment of truth, Mr. Gonzales said, comes when the students graduate from college. Many excel academically, but without work authorization, they cannot be legally employed. Some immigrants with bachelor's degrees end up busing restaurant dishes and cleaning offices, falling back on the jobs of their less educated parents, who often struggled to put them through college.\par \par \uc2 Hostility toward illegal immigrants has grown in many states. Lawmakers in Georgia and Virginia are considering measures to ban illegal immigrants from all public colleges. Bills to deny state resident tuition rates to illegal immigrants are under consideration here in Wisconsin, as well as in Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana. Only a few states, like Colorado and Maryland, are going the opposite direction, debating measures to allow illegal immigrants to pay the lower in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 In the absence of a student bill in Congress, Obama administration officials are doing little to assist illegal immigrants who might be eligible for legal status if it passed. Department of Homeland Security officials said they would continue to reject any broad moratorium on deportations for those students.\par \par \uc2 Immigration agents have been instructed to focus on arresting immigrants who are convicted criminals, implicitly steering away from students without criminal records. When students do get caught, officials are using executive powers to postpone or cancel their deportations, they said.\par \par \uc2 Brian P. Hale, the senior spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the agency ''uses discretion on a case by case basis, as appropriate.''\par \par \uc2 But senior administration officials said they did not want to make wider use of those powers for fear of deepening the conflict with Mr. Smith and other Republicans, who might try to limit the authority granted by immigration law and further stiffen their opposition to measures like the Dream Act. The officials spoke anonymously, saying they could discuss policy more freely that way.\par \par \uc2 The strategizing in Washington is doing little for Ms. Aguilar, 19, a junior at Marquette University here.\par \par \uc2 ''If your name is out there immediately attached with 'undocumented,' then there is always this fear of being deported,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Aguilar said she was not as dispirited as many other students like her because she still felt the elation that came after she revealed her illegal status, then traveled to Washington to watch the December vote from the Senate gallery.\par \par \uc2 ''I think losing the shame overshadows the fear,'' she said. ''I'd much rather clarify to the public that being undocumented is just a circumstance I find myself in. I'd much rather have that out in the public than just living in fear.''\par \par \uc2 Immigrant activists say that coming out may have given some protection to student leaders like Ms. Aguilar, since administration officials would prefer to avoid the furor that would follow if one of them was detained. Ms. Aguilar also admits she has not yet had to face some of the hardest consequences of her status. An honors student in her Milwaukee high school, she was accepted to Marquette, a private Jesuit university, on a full tuition scholarship.\par \par \uc2 After the Senate vote, she said, she is working with an immigrant organization here to build new support for the student bill.\par \par \uc2 ''It failed and we were all like super bummed out,'' she said. ''So we came out of there crying, but defiant. We were like, one day we're going to pass this, don't even worry about it.''\par \par \uc2 That pluck is not shared by Jose Varible, 19, another \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, who was brought to the United States at age 9 by his parents. A student in business management at Gateway Technical College, a community college in Kenosha, Wis., Mr. Varible also held a formal coming out ceremony last summer.\par \par \uc2 Since he is not eligible for any financial aid, Mr. Varible struggles to pay his tuition. He cannot drive, since Wisconsin does not issue licenses without proof of legal United States residence. With a knack for technology hardware, he taught himself to repair computers. But without a Social Security number, he can take only odd jobs doing that work.\par \par \uc2 Combined with his new exposure as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , he said, those limitations sometimes sink him into depression. He has even considered moving to Australia.\par \par \uc2 ''You know, the thing is, I just don't feel welcome here,'' he said.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 About 11.2 million illegal immigrants were living in the United States in 2010, a number essentially unchanged from the previous year, according to a report published Tuesday by the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Despite continuing high unemployment among American workers, record deportations by the Obama administration and expanding efforts by states to crack down, the number of unauthorized immigrants in the work force -- about eight million -- was also unchanged, the Pew report found. Those workers were about 5 percent of the American work force.\par \par \uc2 The population of illegal immigrants leveled off after peaking in 2007 at 12 million, then dropping sharply over two years to 11.1 million in 2009, according to the report, which is based on census data. The declines occurred primarily because fewer people from Mexico and Central America came illegally to the United States, Pew concluded.\par \par \uc2 The report found no evidence of an exodus of illegal immigrants from the country. In particular there is no sign that Mexicans, who are the largest group -- 58 percent -- of illegal immigrants, are leaving in larger numbers, the report finds.\par \par \uc2 The Pew report suggests that the high numbers of unauthorized immigrants are confounding enforcement efforts by the Obama administration and also a recent spate of measures by state legislatures to crack down locally on illegal immigration. Federal immigration authorities deported about 400,000 immigrants in each of the last two years, the highest numbers in the country's history, according to Department of Homeland Security officials.\par \par \uc2 ''We just don't see indications that enforcement is pushing people to leave the U.S.,'' said Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer and co-author, with D'Vera Cohn, of the Pew report.\par \par \uc2 The report's findings appeared to bring bad news for groups advocating for a strategy called attrition through enforcement, which inspired many of the tougher state measures, including a law Arizona enacted last year that caused a furor. According to supporters, those laws are intended to make life so difficult for illegal immigrants that they will opt to go home. Although much of Arizona's law was held up by federal courts, other states, including Georgia, Oklahoma and South Carolina, have also adopted tough laws in recent years.\par \par \uc2 But some advocates for that approach said the Obama administration's decision to end high-profile raids in workplaces might have contributed to illegal immigrants' remaining here.\par \par \uc2 ''It could be that the shift away from work-site enforcement is making it more attractive for illegal immigrants to stay here, since they do not feel as threatened at work,'' said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which seeks reduced immigration to the United States.\par \par \uc2 The Pew report found that about 350,000 babies were born in 2009 to families with at least one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parent, a number also unchanged from the previous year, representing about 8 percent of all newborns.\par \par \uc2 Conservative lawmakers in Congress and state legislatures have announced initiatives to cancel automatic United States citizenship for children born here of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents. They argue that birthright citizenship, which is described in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, encourages illegal immigrants to sneak in to have babies here in order to gain American citizenship for them.\par \par \uc2 The Pew report found that about two-thirds of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents of the newborns had been living in the United States for at least five years.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110202e72200019\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A year after the devastating earthquake in Haiti, the American government has received more than 53,000 applications from Haitians seeking temporary legal status in the United States, and it has approved the vast majority, a top immigration official said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The official, Alejandro Mayorkas, director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, said his agency's response to the disaster showed that it could handle a much larger immigrant legalization program like the proposal known as the Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday was the deadline for Haitians to apply for the designation, called temporary protected status. The program gives most Haitians who were in the United States on the day of the earthquake the right to stay and work legally for 18 months while Haiti tries to recover.\par \par \uc2 ''I think our performance and our execution of the T.P.S. program serves as a model of our ability to execute immigration reform programs,'' Mr. Mayorkas said in an interview. ''How quickly, effectively and efficiently we responded to the disaster is a standard for us to adhere to.''\par \par \uc2 The special designation is scheduled to expire on July 22, but advocates for Haitian immigrants say they expect that the government will extend the status, as it has for immigrants from other countries crippled by war or natural disaster.\par \par \uc2 At least 46,000 Haitians have been granted the special designation. Immigration officials said that they were still processing applications that arrived before the deadline, and that they expected the total number of approvals to exceed 49,000. That is still lower than the number of people federal officials initially expected might be eligible for the temporary protection.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials said they had purposely chosen high estimates of the number of Haitians who might have been eligible, to ensure that they had budgeted enough money and manpower to handle the application process. Within several weeks of the announcement, officials said, they revised down to 70,000 to 100,000 their initial estimate of 100,000 to 200,000, after consulting with academics, immigrant advocates and others familiar with the Haitian diaspora.\par \par \uc2 Even now, officials said, since there is no way to count the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population, they do not know how many potentially eligible Haitians decided not to file for the special status.\par \par \uc2 The federal government's offer was accompanied by a robust outreach effort that included more than 200 public forums, and conference calls between immigration officials and advocacy groups working with Haitians, officials said. Mr. Mayorkas himself led meetings with community leaders and others in New York, Miami and Boston, where large Haitian populations have taken root, and he sent deputies to other locations to explain the program.\par \par \uc2 Officials at Citizenship and Immigration Services, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, also say that improvements to the agency's paperwork processing, background screening and public information systems have made it more efficient at handling applications.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mayorkas acknowledged that sweeping immigration legislation like the Dream Act would apply to a much larger population: by some estimates, more than 700,000 young illegal immigrants would be eligible under the act. But he said that the difference was ''an issue of scale'' and that his agency was prepared to handle the increase in applications that an immigration overhaul would spur.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates and federal officials said that news of the special status seemed to penetrate into the furthest reaches of the diaspora, but some Haitians living in the United States illegally may have decided not to apply because they still feared deportation and did not want to alert the authorities to their whereabouts.\par \par \uc2 Those who did not apply may now be eligible for deportation. The Obama administration suspended deportations to Haiti immediately after the earthquake and even released many Haitians, including some with criminal convictions.\par \par \uc2 Last month, however, immigration officials announced that they would resume deportations of Haitians in mid-January. But they also said they intended to focus their deportation efforts only on those who had been convicted of crimes or who posed a threat to public safety.\par \par \uc2 Haitian leaders in the United States and some public officials have asked the administration to reverse course. On Wednesday, six New York City Council members sent a letter to Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary, urging her to suspend deportations once again while Haiti wrestles with its halting reconstruction effort and with fresh political and social unrest.\par \par \uc2 ''Removing Haitians at this time would not only put those removed at risk,'' the letter said, ''but also hamper efforts of Haitians to rebuild their country, homes and lives.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: A Haitian immigrant, back to camera, being helped last January in a clinic to apply for temporary legal status. Most of the 53,000 Haitians who applied by the deadline Tuesday gained the status.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column.\par \par \uc2 Three reasons Gov. Rick Perry declared sanctuary cities an ''emergency item'' for the Texas Legislature: A nativist electorate, a reluctance to mimic Arizona on immigration law and the closing commercial in his campaign for re-election last year.\par \par \uc2 Here's one more: The first 60 days of a legislative session offer the governor a moment of control over the agenda, and he has decided to point the spotlight, for now, on immigration and property rights, the second issue he declared to be an emergency. He hasn't done it yet, but passing voter photo ID is a good bet for the next act in the center ring.\par \par \uc2 The governor is, in effect, alone on the stage. Lawmakers can't deliberate on bills for the first 60 days of the 140-day session unless he says so, by declaring emergencies. They don't have to be emergencies, necessarily, but the process allows lawmakers to handle pressing business, while letting the governor drive the agenda during the session's first weeks. For Mr. Perry, it's a chance to deal with immigration matters before the budget, redistricting and other issues claim the limelight.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Perry's focus on sanctuary cities -- those that do not allow their police officers to enforce federal immigration laws -- could offer him safe passage through the contentious immigration debate. Arizona wants its police to question the immigration status of anyone they suspect is in the country illegally. Mr. Perry wouldn't require police to ask, but would allow it.\par \par \uc2 It's a fine distinction for a Republican Party trying to win favor with Hispanics while quelling a rebellion from nativist conservatives. Mr. Perry wants to answer the anger of the second group without stoking it in the first.\par \par \uc2 In the governor's race, he and Bill White battled over whether Houston was a sanctuary city while Mr. White was mayor. Houston never had an official edict from its City Council or mayor, but the police followed a general order against asking about the citizenship of people who hadn't been arrested (they did run immigration checks after arrests).\par \par \uc2 Some, including many police chiefs, argue that asking for papers all the time gets in the way of regular police work and makes it harder for officers to win the trust of citizens whose help is needed to fight crime. Mr. Perry hit that note in a statement last April, rejecting the Arizona standard because ''some aspects of the law turn law enforcement officers into immigration officials by requiring them to determine immigration status during any lawful contact with a suspected alien, taking them away from their existing law enforcement duties, which are critical to keeping citizens safe.'' The Texas Department of Public Safety's policy under Mr. Perry is remarkably similar to Houston's and other big cities in the state.\par \par \uc2 The argument stopped there, for a while. Then Mr. Perry closed his campaign with a television ad featuring Sgt. Joslyn Johnson, a Houston police officer whose husband, Rodney, also a police officer, was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  during a traffic stop. This being a political ad, it blamed Mr. White's policies as mayor for that death.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Perry doesn't want to copy Arizona's immigration law, he said during the campaign that he understood the sentiment that led to it, and that Texas should step in and protect its borders if the federal government won't. So the policy and the politics don't exactly match up. He has got to do something -- he campaigned on it -- but doesn't want to do what Arizona did.\par \par \uc2 If he doesn't jump in, the Legislature surely will. By the end of the week, lawmakers had already filed 30 bills with the word ''immigration'' in them, including legislation that would require police officers to inquire into the immigration status of people they've arrested. That's before you get to the goodies like anchor babies, state services for non-citizens, immigration records of public school students and sanctuary cities; this, along with the budget and redistricting, is front and center this session.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Perry and his aides can't or won't name any sanctuary cities, but the governor said he was going to make it illegal to be one. He said last week that there were cities that had ''made decisions to be havens for those who are either in conflict with federal immigration laws, or state laws, and we're going to prohibit that.\par \par \uc2 ''We'll have a good and open discussion about what we're going to prohibit,'' he said, ''and if the shoe is fitting you, then you might not want to be wearing it.''\par \par \uc2 It's a potentially treacherous issue, and for now, that's as specific as he's going to get.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Gov.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 My company now requires all employees to complete a self-directed training course on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, relevant to our overseas staff but not to my job. This training takes about four hours, time better spent on something more productive, and was not a condition of my employment. Until I transfer into a job that involves me with foreign officials or companies, am I ethically obligated to complete the training? J.H., BOSTON\par \par \uc2 It's not so much that you have an ethical obligation to take the training as you are obliged to avoid the misconduct of dodging it: you would have to deceive your boss, actively or passively. You would do better simply to tell your supervisors what you've told me. If you're right and they're reasonable -- bold assumptions -- then they would be foolish to ignore your ideas for improving productivity.\par \par \uc2 They might, however, have designs invisible to you -- the ability to rapidly transfer employees into positions for which this training is essential, for example. Even if they have no such plans but are strictly adhering to a dimwitted policy, that does not permit you to ignore legitimate demands or lie about having done so. Your employer's inefficiency would not justify your deceit. Companies routinely waste time. (Unlike my taking a break to play Sudoku. And snack. And nap. Those things clear my head and improve my efficiency.)\par \par \uc2 Nor did the company err by failing to mention this training when it hired you. It must have some flexibility to introduce new practices. That does not put all such innovations beyond criticism; it does say that the lack of advanced notice does not of itself condemn such a change.\par \par \uc2 UPDATE: J.H. got the course materials. He did not read them but immediately took the online test, passed it and was certified as having mastered the course work. He said it was ''simplistic.''\par \par \uc2 I work for a social-services organization. A company in a distant state has been reporting wages to the government that it supposedly pays one of my clients, using her Social Security number. My client does not work for this company. I suspect that the person using her number might be a struggling \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  whose exposure could lead to deportation or worse. My client asked me to sort this out with that company, fearing future problems from identity theft. Should I? L.G., TACOMA, WASH.\par \par \uc2 Your client, apparently the victim of a crime, has asked you to protect her from what could be trouble down the road, including tax implications. How can you refuse? That the perpetrator may face economic hardship of his own -- not malicious, just trying to get by -- makes this a painful dilemma but is insufficient reason to decline your client's request.\par \par \uc2 The sad irony is that your client may actually benefit from this situation. Someone else's work is generating payments for her Social Security account. Although if she starts a new job or participates in government programs in your state, some official might -- will, we hope -- notice that she is simultaneously working in another state, suggesting either fraud or the ability to travel at hyperspeed, which, if the latter, could be the technological breakthrough America needs to be a country of robust innovation (not like that ridiculous Segway).\par \par \uc2 UPDATE: L.G. contacted the employer, which discovered that an employee was fraudulently using the Social Security number; the employee was fired.\par \par \uc2 E-MAIL queries to ethicist@nytimes.com, or send them to the Ethicist, The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2 , 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10018, and include a daytime phone number.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Conservative legislators from five states opened a national campaign on Wednesday to end the automatic granting of American citizenship to children born in the United States of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 At a news conference here timed to coincide with the start of a new Congress, Republican state lawmakers introduced two model measures curtailing citizenship rights for children of illegal immigrants. The legislators said the measures would be introduced in at least 14 states.\par \par \uc2 They acknowledged that the state bills were not likely to have a practical effect anytime soon, since they will quickly be challenged as unconstitutional. But the legislators -- from Arizona, Georgia, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina -- said they chose the first day of a new Republican-controlled House of Representatives to start an effort that they hope will end with a Supreme Court decision on birthright citizenship, and spur legislative action in Washington.\par \par \uc2 In a separate effort, Representative Steve King of Iowa, a Republican who will be chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, said Wednesday that as soon as the new House members were sworn in, he would introduce a bill to eliminate birthright citizenship for children when both parents were illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But it was the state lawmakers' initiative that moved the highly emotional issue of birthright citizenship, which had long been marginal in the immigration debate, to the front of the Republicans' immigration agenda in the 112th Congress.\par \par \uc2 ''We are here to send a very public message to Congress,'' said Daryl Metcalfe, a Republican state representative from Pennsylvania. ''We want to bring an end to the illegal alien invasion that is having such a negative impact on our states.''\par \par \uc2 The states' campaign brought an outcry from immigrant, Latino and African-American civil rights organizations. Several of them announced they had formed a coalition to bring court challenges to any birthright citizenship laws that passed state legislatures.\par \par \uc2 ''For the first time since the end of the Civil War, these legislators want to pass state laws that would create two tiers of citizens, a modern-day caste system,'' said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Human and Civil Rights, which includes many African-American groups.\par \par \uc2 His group is in the new coalition, along with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Council of La Raza, among others.\par \par \uc2 The lawmakers were challenged even before they finished speaking. The news conference, held at the National Press Club, was interrupted four times by protesters who stood one by one to brandish posters and accuse the lawmakers of intolerance and racism. One protester cited welcoming words for immigrants inscribed at the site of the Statue of Liberty.\par \par \uc2 A brief scuffle erupted when a man who was a supporter of the state initiatives seized one protester by the arm and tried to march him out of the room. Also present were supporters of the lawmakers, who clapped and cheered.\par \par \uc2 One model measure the lawmakers presented was a bill creating a new definition of state citizenship, in addition to national citizenship, which would exclude babies born in the state with two \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents.\par \par \uc2 The second measure was a compact between states, in which they would agree to issue distinctive birth certificates to babies whose parents could not show legal immigration status.\par \par \uc2 The state bills would also deny citizenship to newborn children of hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants who live in the United States on temporary visas.\par \par \uc2 The right to United States citizenship for everyone born on American soil is described in the 14th Amendment. The state legislators argued that one phrase in the amendment -- which guarantees citizenship to everyone born or naturalized in this country ''and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' -- signals that it was not intended to apply to children of immigrants who do not have lawful status.\par \par \uc2 The 14th Amendment was adopted in the wake of the Civil War to guarantee citizenship to the American-born children of freed slaves. In the debate on Wednesday, there were frequent references to the Civil War.\par \par \uc2 Daniel B. Verdin, a senior Republican state senator from South Carolina, called illegal immigration ''a malady of epic proportions,'' which he said compared with ''the malady of slavery.''\par \par \uc2 The state lawmakers said illegal immigrants had a dire effect on state budgets. Mr. Metcalfe said that Pennsylvania was facing ''nothing less than an invasion,'' and that Congress had a constitutional responsibility to protect states from foreign invasion.\par \par \uc2 Kris Kobach, a constitutional lawyer who was recently elected secretary of state of Kansas, said the proposed laws were carefully written to avoid usurping federal authority, but to ''revive the concept of state citizenship.''\par \par \uc2 But opponents of the proposals said that determining American citizenship was clearly a federal matter in which states had no legal role.\par \par \uc2 ''We believe these laws cannot survive constitutional scrutiny,'' said Lucas Guttentag, director of the immigrants' rights project of the American Civil Liberties Union, another group in the new coalition.\par \par \uc2 Mr. King, the Iowa congressman, said the birthright citizenship bill he would introduce might not be his first priority for passage. He said he would focus first on legislation to crack down on employers who hire unauthorized immigrant workers.\par \par \uc2 Several House lawmakers said Mr. King's citizenship bill could pass, although it was likely to be defeated in the Senate, where Democrats hold a majority.\par \par \uc2 ''I would have said a year ago that Republicans would not embrace anything so drastic,'' said Representative Charlie Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. ''But anything is possible now.''\par \par \uc2 Some Latino Republicans expressed dismay that the party was making birthright citizenship a central element of its immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 ''Rather than attacking babies born in the United States and the Constitution, we demand they target our suffering economy,'' said Deedee Garcia Blase, a spokeswoman for Somos Republicans, a Texas-based organization of Latino Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110106e71600022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A week before leaving office, Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. announced Tuesday that Colorado would participate in a federal background check program devised to catch illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.\par \par \uc2 The announcement comes after months of debate in Colorado over the program -- known as Secure Communities -- which allows local law enforcement officials to check the immigration history of those they arrest in a government database.\par \par \uc2 Officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that runs Secure Communities in 35 other states, have said the program plugs holes in a system that allows illegal immigrants with criminal records to escape deportation.\par \par \uc2 A coalition of immigrant rights and civil liberties groups in Colorado had pressed Mr. Ritter, a Democrat, to reject the program, fearing it would drive a wedge between immigrants and law enforcement, and discourage witnesses from reporting crimes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ritter had considered putting Secure Communities in place since a task force recommended the program after a deadly car accident in Aurora in 2008. In that accident, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , who had eluded deportation despite more than a dozen arrests, drove his S.U.V. into a truck, killing three people.\par \par \uc2 Some political allies, like Representative Jared Polis, a fellow Democrat, had urged Mr. Ritter not to institute Secure Communities, while state Republicans and local law enforcement associations supported it.\par \par \uc2 ''As the last act of Governor Ritter, it sends a terrible message to the people of Colorado that our civil liberties and our civil rights can be violated,'' said Jessie Ulibarri, public policy director for the A.C.L.U. of Colorado at a news conference after the announcement. ''It incentivizes racial profiling by allowing police officers to stop people they suspect of being undocumented.''\par \par \uc2 State Republican leaders applauded the decision, calling it an important step toward battling illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Mr. Ritter noted that Colorado's program would contain modifications to ensure it operated effectively. They include receiving quarterly reports from the immigration agency so Secure Communities can be evaluated, as well as an acknowledgment that domestic-violence victims and witnesses warrant unique treatment under the program.\par \par \uc2 ''My office has worked closely with stakeholders and the federal government over the past few months to address Colorado-specific concerns and modify the standard Secure Communities agreement,'' Mr. Ritter said.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. said Colorado would join a program devised to catch illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 NOGALES, Ariz. -- Of the 50 or so women bused to this border town on a recent morning to be deported back to Mexico, Inez Vasquez stood out. Eight months pregnant, she had tried to trudge north in her fragile state, even carrying scissors with her in case she gave birth in the desert and had to cut the umbilical cord.\par \par \uc2 ''All I want is a better life,'' she said after the Border Patrol found her hiding in bushes on the Arizona side of the border with her husband, her young son and her very pronounced abdomen.\par \par \uc2 The next big immigration battle centers on illegal immigrants' offspring, who are granted automatic citizenship like all other babies born on American soil. Arguing for an end to the policy, which is rooted in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, immigration hard-liners describe a wave of migrants like Ms. Vasquez stepping across the border in the advanced stages of pregnancy to have what are dismissively called ''anchor babies.''\par \par \uc2 The reality at this stretch of the border is more complex, with hospitals reporting some immigrants arriving to give birth in the United States but many of them frequent border crossers with valid visas who have crossed the border legally to take advantage of better medical care. Some are even attracted by an electronic billboard on the Mexican side that advertises the services of an American doctor and says bluntly, ''Do you want to have your baby in the U.S.?''\par \par \uc2 Women like Ms. Vasquez, who was preparing for a desert delivery, are rare.\par \par \uc2 Still, Arizona -- whose tough law granting the police the power to detain illegal immigrants is tied up in the courts -- may again take the lead in what is essentially an effort to redefine what it means to be an American. This time, though, Arizona lawmakers intend to join with legislators from other states to force the issue before the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 This coalition of lawmakers will unveil its exact plans on Wednesday in Washington, but people involved in drafting the legislation say they have decided against the painstaking process of amending the Constitution. Since the federal government decides who is to be deemed a citizen, the lawmakers are considering instead a move to create two kinds of birth certificates in their states, one for the children of citizens and another for the children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The theory is that this could spark a flurry of lawsuits that might resolve the legal conflict in their favor.\par \par \uc2 ''This is not a far-out, extremist position,'' said John Kavanagh, one of the Arizona legislators who is leading an effort that has been called just that. ''Only a handful of countries in the world grant citizenship based on the GPS location of the birth.''\par \par \uc2 Most scholars of the Constitution consider the states' effort to restrict birth certificates patently unconstitutional. ''This is political theater, not a serious effort to create a legal test,'' said Gabriel J. Chin, a law professor at the University of Arizona whose grandfather immigrated to the United States from China at a time when ethnic Chinese were excluded from the country. ''It strikes me as unwise, un-American and unconstitutional.''\par \par \uc2 The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, was a repudiation of the Supreme Court's 1857 ruling, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, that people of African descent could never be American citizens. The amendment said citizenship applied to ''all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.''\par \par \uc2 In 1898, the Supreme Court, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, interpreted the citizenship provision as applying to a child born in the United States to a Chinese immigrant couple.\par \par \uc2 Still, some conservatives contend that the issue is unsettled. Kris Kobach, the incoming secretary of state in Kansas and a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City who has helped draft many of the tough immigration regulations across the country, argued that the approach the states were planning would hold up to scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 ''I can't really say much more without showing my hand,'' Mr. Kobach said in an e-mail. ''But, yes, I am confident that the law will stand up in court.''\par \par \uc2 The legal theories are lost on Laura Gomez, 24, who crossed into Arizona from Mexico five years ago while expecting and is now pregnant with her second child. But like many other pregnant women in Arizona who are without papers, she has been following the issue with anxiety.\par \par \uc2 ''It doesn't seem fair to just change the rules like that,'' Ms. Gomez said.\par \par \uc2 Despite being called ''anchor babies,'' the children of illegal immigrants born in the United States cannot actually prevent deportation of their parents. It is not until they reach the age of 21 that the children are able to file paperwork to sponsor their parents for legal immigration status. The parents remain vulnerable until that point.\par \par \uc2 Maria Ledezma knows as much. Just off a bus that deported her from Phoenix to the Mexico border town of Nogales, she was sobbing as she explained the series of events that led her to be separated from her three daughters, ages 4, 7 and 9, all American citizens.\par \par \uc2 ''I never imagined being here,'' said Ms. Ledezma, 25, who was brought to Phoenix from Mexico as a toddler. ''I'll bet right now that my girls are asking, 'Where's Mom?' ''\par \par \uc2 Blended families like hers are a reality across the United States. A studyreleased in August by the Pew Hispanic Center found that about 340,000 children were born to illegal immigrants in the United States in 2008 and became instant citizens.\par \par \uc2 In April, Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, one of those pushing for Congressional action on the issue, stirred controversy when he suggested that children born in the United States to illegal immigrants should be deported with their parents until the birthright citizenship policy was changed.\par \par \uc2 ''And we're not being mean,'' Mr. Hunter told a Tea Party rally in Southern California. ''We're just saying it takes more than walking across the border to become an American citizen. It's what's in our souls.''\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates say intolerance is driving the measure. ''They call themselves patriots, but they pick and choose which parts of the Constitution they support,'' said Lydia Guzman, a Latino activist in Phoenix. ''They're fear-mongerers. They're clowns.''\par \par \uc2 Like many states, Arizona is suffering a severe budget crisis, prompting even some lawmakers who have supported immigration restrictions in the past to question whether it is the right time for another divisive immigration bill. They say the state's fiscal issues need to be resolved before Arizona jumps back into a controversial immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 ''I was born and raised in New York,'' responded Mr. Kavanagh, who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the Arizona House. ''I can ride a subway, drink coffee, read the newspaper and make sure my pockets are not picked all at the same time.''\par \par \uc2 Scholars who have studied migration say it is the desire for better-paying jobs, not a passport for their children, that is the main motivator for people to leave their homes for the United States.\par \par \uc2 Even Ms. Vasquez, who was preparing for a desert delivery, agrees with that. While she preferred to have her child be born in the United States, she said, it was the prospect of a better economic future, with or without papers, that had prompted her and her family to cross when they did. ''I'll try again -- but once the baby's born,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Online Correction: January 4, 2011, Tuesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the year that the Supreme Court, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, applied the citizenship provision to a child born in the United States to Chinese immigrants; it was 1898.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Laura Gomez, a pregnant \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, in Scottsdale, Ariz.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Legislative leaders in at least half a dozen states say they will propose bills similar to a controversial law to fight illegal immigration that was adopted by Arizona last spring, even though a federal court has suspended central provisions of that statute.\par \par \uc2 The efforts, led by Republicans, are part of a wave of state measures coming this year aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Legislators have also announced measures to limit access to public colleges and other benefits for illegal immigrants and to punish employers who hire them.\par \par \uc2 Next week, at least five states plan to begin an unusual coordinated effort to cancel automatic United States citizenship for children born in this country to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents.\par \par \uc2 Opponents say that effort would be unconstitutional, arguing that the power to grant citizenship resides with the federal government, not with the states. Still, the chances of passing many of these measures appear better than at any time since 2006, when many states, frustrated with inaction in Washington, began proposing initiatives to curb illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Republicans gained more than 690 seats in state legislatures nationwide in the November midterms, winning their strongest representation at the state level in more than 80 years.\par \par \uc2 Few people expect movement on immigration issues when Congress reconvenes next week in a divided Washington. Republicans, who will control the House of Representatives, do not support an overhaul of immigration laws that President Obama has promised to continue to push. State lawmakers say it has fallen to them to act.\par \par \uc2 ''The federal government's failure to enforce our border has functionally turned every state into a border state,'' said Randy Terrill, a Republican representative in Oklahoma who has led the drive for anti-illegal immigration laws there. ''This is federalism in action,'' he said. ''The states are stepping in and filling the void left by the federal government.''\par \par \uc2 But the proposals have already drawn opposition from some business groups. And they are forcing strategic soul-searching within the Republican Party nationwide, with a rising populist base on one side demanding tough immigration measures, and, on the other side, traditional Republican supporters in business and a fast-growing Latino electorate strongly opposing those measures.\par \par \uc2 In Utah, a state dominated by Republicans, leaders from business, law enforcement, several churches and the Latino community sought to bridge the divide by joining together in November in a compact urging moderation on immigration issues.\par \par \uc2 Some of the more contentious measures may not go into effect immediately, including Arizona-style bills and those intended to eliminate birthright citizenship for American-born children of illegal immigrants. Latino and immigrant advocate legal organizations are gearing up for a host of court challenges.\par \par \uc2 Among the states expected to introduce bills similar to Arizona's are Georgia, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law authorized the state and local police to ask about the immigration status of anyone they detained for other reasons, if they had a ''reasonable suspicion'' that the person was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Acting on a lawsuit filed by the Obama administration, a federal judge stayed central provisions of the law. In November, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard arguments on an appeal of that stay by Arizona.\par \par \uc2 ''States will push ahead regardless of the Ninth Circuit,'' said Kris Kobach, a law professor and politician from Kansas who helped many states devise immigration laws -- including Arizona's. ''A lot of people recognize that the district judge's decision is very much open to dispute.''\par \par \uc2 In Oklahoma, where Republicans won big majorities in both houses of the Legislature and the governor's office, Mr. Terrill said he would introduce a bill he called ''Arizona plus.'' In addition to the terms of Arizona's law, it would allow for the seizure of vehicles and property used to transport or harbor illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In Georgia, an all-Republican commission of legislators plans to propose measures to enhance enforcement of tough laws already on the books. Georgia will also consider a bill to bar \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students from all public universities.\par \par \uc2 The newly elected governor, Nathan Deal, a Republican, is expected to sign those bills. But the Georgia Farm Bureau, which represents the state's powerful growers, voted to oppose any measures that would affect immigrant farm workers, most of whom do not have legal status.\par \par \uc2 In Kansas, Republicans won big majorities in both legislative houses and Sam Brownback, who just retired as a United States senator, was elected governor. Mr. Kobach, the law professor, was elected secretary of state after a campaign in which he vowed to pass a law requiring proof of citizenship for voters.\par \par \uc2 But the Kansas Chamber of Commerce has voiced its opposition, and Mr. Brownback has said he will focus on reducing unemployment.\par \par \uc2 The newest initiative is a joint effort among lawmakers from states including Arizona, Oklahoma, Missouri and Pennsylvania to pass laws based on a single model that would deny American citizenship to children born in those states to illegal immigrants. The legislators were to announce the campaign in Washington on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 A leader of that effort is Daryl Metcalfe, a Republican state representative from Pennsylvania. At a recent news conference, Mr. Metcalfe said his goal was to eliminate ''an anchor baby status, in which an illegal alien invader comes into our country and has a child on our soil that is granted citizenship automatically.''\par \par \uc2 The campaign is certain to run into legal obstacles. Courts have interpreted the 14th Amendment as guaranteeing birthright citizenship. Even among those who seek its repeal, debate has hinged on whether that would require a constitutional amendment, an act of Congress or a decision by the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Some Republicans argue that the party is risking losing its appeal to Latino voters, the fastest-growing minority voter bloc.\par \par \uc2 ''The Republican Party is divided between those who see that Hispanics are an essential constituency going forward, and those who don't see that,'' said Tamar Jacoby, a Republican who is the president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a business coalition that supports legalization for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Latino and immigrant advocate groups are resigned to being on the defensive for the next two years. ''These laws are creating resentment within the Latino community that is going to last for decades,'' said Tony Yapias, director of Proyecto Latino de Utah in Salt Lake City, an immigrant advocacy group.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020110101e71100033\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A 73-year-old Polish woman from Greenpoint, Brooklyn, picked up the phone in late November and heard a young man's voice speaking in Polish: ''Hey, auntie, it's me.''\par \par \uc2 ''I thought it was my sister's grandson, Sebastian,'' said the woman, a retired cook who spoke on the condition that her name not be used. ''Sebastian visited me from Poland twice, so somehow I thought it was him.''\par \par \uc2 The man, she said, sounded a little strange, but he explained that he had a cold that was affecting his voice. He told her he was at a car dealership and was about to buy the car of his dreams at a bargain price but did not have enough money. He asked her to lend him some, as much as she could, and he would pay her back the next day. She agreed. Then he called again and said he could not leave the dealership or he would lose the car, so a friend would drop by to pick up the money.\par \par \uc2 At first, she gave out $10,000. But shortly after she handed the money over, he called again asking for a little bit more because he did not have enough for insurance. So a few minutes later, she gave an additional $2,500.\par \par \uc2 She never got it back. It was a fraud. The woman called her daughter, who lives in New Jersey. ''She said: 'Mom, Sebastian would never come to the U.S. without calling us from Poland first,' '' said the woman, her voice halting nervously, adding that she had been under so much stress since the episode that she was taking sedatives. ''I can't even explain how it happened. I'm not that naive. But it was so quick. I just wanted to help someone from my family.''\par \par \uc2 That's precisely what the schemers were counting on. ''Who would expect that someone will call and claim to be your family member?'' said Capt. Stefan Komar, the executive officer of the 94th Precinct in Greenpoint, who speaks Polish. ''Just the chutzpah of this crime makes it unlikely.'' The 73-year-old woman was not the only victim in the neighborhood. At least four other elderly people gave out money, men and women, losing amounts from $5,000 to $20,000. Each time, the scheme was the same. The only variable was whether the caller introduced himself as a grandson, nephew or some other family member.\par \par \uc2 After an article about the fraud appeared in a Polish-language newspaper, a man named Jan - he spoke on the condition that his whole name not be used - called the police. He said he had been asked for $4,000, but he never handed it over. He became suspicious when the man picking up the money could not show him ID of the relative he said he knew. ''But when we spoke, I had a chance to get a really good look at him,'' the man said. ''He was very neat and slim, and fashionably dressed.''\par \par \uc2 Then, last Saturday, more than two weeks after that encounter, Jan was walking to the precinct house to meet a detective when he spotted the suspect entering a Polish diner, Pyza on Nassau Avenue. He ran to the station house and returned to the restaurant with detectives. The man was no longer there, so they started circling around in an unmarked police car - and caught him two blocks away.\par \par \uc2 ''You couldn't miss him - he had a long fake fur jacket and a hat,'' said Joseph Notwicz, a Polish-speaking detective assigned to the case, who made the arrest. According to the police, the suspect, Waldemar Kordecki, 29, turned out to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , using a fraudulent green card, Social Security card and credit cards, as well as a fake Maryland driver's license.\par \par \uc2 ''But he was very cooperative,'' Detective Notwicz said. ''He even showed us another building where he got the money, so we went inside and I spoke to the Polish lady who was too embarrassed to make a police report earlier.''\par \par \uc2 While in police custody, Mr. Kordecki received a text message from his accomplice asking him to meet in a bar in Jackson Heights, Queens, the police said.\par \par \uc2 ''There were his pictures in the phone so we knew what he looked like,'' said Detective Notwicz, who a short time later arrested Piotr Lakatosz, 29, also an illegal Polish immigrant who the police said was making the phone calls.\par \par \uc2 The police said both men lived in Manhattan but would come to the Polish enclave in Greenpoint and make calls to numbers they found through a phone computer program. ''I've heard the same scam was reported in Poland,'' Captain Komar said. ''It's just sad that these guys were preying on the elders from their own ethnic group.''\par \par \uc2 The oldest victim was a 90-year-old war veteran. He lost $5,000, the police said. An 83-year-old woman gave out $10,000, the police said. She said it was money she had been saving for her funeral.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Waldemar Kordecki with Detectives Jamie Arroyo, left, and Joseph Notwicz.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The vote by the Senate on Saturday to block a bill to grant legal status to hundreds of thousands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students was a painful setback to an emerging movement of immigrants and also appeared to leave the immigration policy of the Obama administration, which has supported the bill and the movement, in disarray.\par \par \uc2 The bill, known as the Dream Act, gained 55 votes in favor with 41 against, a tally short of the 60 votes needed to bring it to the floor for debate. Five Democrats broke ranks to vote against the bill, while only three Republicans voted for it. The defeat in the Senate came after the House of Representatives passed the bill last week.\par \par \uc2 The result, although not unexpected, was still a rebuff to President Obama by newly empowered Republicans in Congress on an issue he has called one of his priorities. Supporters believed that the bill -- tailored to benefit only immigrants who were brought here illegally when they were children and hoped to attend college or enlist in the military -- was the easiest piece to pass out of a larger overhaul of immigration laws that Mr. Obama supports.\par \par \uc2 His administration has pursued a two-sided policy, coupling tough enforcement -- producing a record number of about 390,000 deportations this year -- with an effort to pass the overhaul, which would open a path to legal status for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. Now, with less hope for any legalization measures once Republicans take over the House in January, the administration is left with just the stick.\par \par \uc2 Part of the administration's strategy has been to ramp up border and workplace enforcement to attract Republican votes for the overhaul. The vote on Saturday made it clear that strategy has not succeeded so far.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama will now face growing pressure from immigrant and Latino groups to temper the crackdown and perhaps find ways to use executive powers to bring some illegal immigrants out of the shadows. Latino voters turned out in strength for the Democrats in the midterm elections, arguably saving their majority in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 The Republicans in the new Congress are especially keen on tough enforcement. The presumed incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on immigration is Representative Steve King of Iowa, a vigorous opponent of legalization measures, which he rejects as amnesty for lawbreakers. Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, who will be chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is also an outspoken and well-versed opponent of such proposals.\par \par \uc2 Groups favoring reduced immigration cheered Saturday's vote as a watershed victory marking the end of a period when they have been on the defensive. Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, which lobbied hard against the bill, said the new Congress ''has the strongest pro-enforcement membership'' in at least 15 years.\par \par \uc2 ''Now, we look forward to moving aggressively to offense,'' Mr. Beck said.\par \par \uc2 During the last year, administration officials considered proposals to allow immigration authorities to use administrative powers to halt deportations of illegal immigrants who might have been eligible for legal status under the student bill. They also sought ways to ease deportations for other illegal immigrants with no criminal record.\par \par \uc2 Republican lawmakers criticized those proposals as ''backdoor amnesty'' and pledged to stop the administration from carrying them out.\par \par \uc2 The administration's efforts to manage its policy dilemma played out this week. Speaking on Friday before the vote, John Morton, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the agency would continue the brisk pace of deportations, focusing on immigrants convicted of crimes. On the same day, the agency released from detention an 18-year-old Guatemalan student from Ohio, Bernard Pastor, granting him a one-year reprieve from deportation to continue his education.\par \par \uc2 Despite the defeat, Democrats who supported the bill said they would continue to push for it. ''As long as these young people are determined to be part of this great nation, I am determined to fight for them to call America home,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the bill's main champion.\par \par \uc2 Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, another sponsor, said Latinos would remember in the elections in 2012 how senators had voted.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a vote that will not soon be forgotten by a community that is growing not just in size, but also in power and political awareness,'' Mr. Menendez said.\par \par \uc2 Yet much pressure on the administration may come from immigrant organizations. Despite their illegal status, several hundred immigrant students watched the vote in the Senate gallery. Afterward, they held a somber prayer vigil in the basement of the Capitol, but moved on to a news conference that turned into a pep rally.\par \par \uc2 ''They did not defeat us, they ignited our fire,'' said Alina Cortes, a 19-year-old Mexican-born immigrant from Texas who lacks legal status. A self-described conservative Republican, she campaigned for the student bill, saying she hoped to join the Marine Corps.\par \par \uc2 The movement has been driven by thousands of students who ''came out'' to reveal that they did not have legal status, and to recount their academic achievements and the barriers they faced. Now that their status is public, they have nowhere to hide. Meanwhile, an estimated 65,000 illegal immigrants are graduating from high school each year.\par \par \uc2 ''We have woken up,'' said Carlos Saavedra, national coordinator of the United We Dream Network, a student group. ''We are going to go around the country letting everybody know who stands with us and who stood against us.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Supporters of the ''Dream Act'' measure consoled each other Saturday after senators blocked it.

All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 Alan Garcia, 15, sat on a bench while his classmates played basketball. The other students might have thought he was too lazy or too shy to play. The truth was simpler: His family was too poor. Alan's father could not afford to buy him a pair of sneakers for gym class.\par \par \uc2 Alan owned one pair of shoes, the black dress shoes he wore every day to school. His father, Luis Garcia, wrote the gym teacher a note, explaining the situation. Alan, a sophomore at the Foreign Language Academy of Global Studies, a public high school in the South Bronx, sat on the bench for about 10 classes in September, sometimes watching the others play, sometimes reading.\par \par \uc2 ''I never put pressure on him, because I know how he feels,'' Alan said of his father.\par \par \uc2 To Alan, gym shoes were a trivial concern. Mr. Garcia, 36, is a single father raising three boys. They lived in a homeless shelter in Brooklyn for six years before moving to an apartment in the Bronx last year. They survive on the roughly $300 Mr. Garcia receives each month from public assistance. The rent for their two-bedroom apartment is subsidized by the city's Department of Homeless Services, but because Mr. Garcia does not qualify for food stamps, there is often no money for food. Churches, soup kitchens and the boys' schools have supplied most of their meals.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garcia does not work because he has to take care of one of Alan's brothers, Luis Angel, 13. Angel was born with a rare disorder that has left him severely disabled and using a wheelchair. Angel has arthrogryposis multiplex congenita -- arthrogryposis is a Greek word meaning ''curved or hooked joints.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garcia feeds Angel, dresses him, brushes his teeth. He wakes up three or four times a night to turn Angel in the bed; it helps the boy sleep more comfortably. Alan and his other brother, Alberto, 12, help, too. They help him with his homework, take off his shoes.\par \par \uc2 ''They are beautiful guys,'' Mr. Garcia said of his sons. ''They are the best.''\par \par \uc2 In late September, a social worker at Alberto's school applied to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, seeking help for the Garcia family. The social worker, Marion S. Wise, works at a mental health clinic that the Children's Aid Society runs at the school, Intermediate School 98 in the Bronx. The Children's Aid Society is one of the seven agencies supported by the Neediest Cases Fund.\par \par \uc2 The Garcia family received $800. They bought clothes for Alberto's school uniform; winter clothing for all three boys; and eggs, bread, beans and other groceries. Alan got his new sneakers, a pair of black, white and red Commander Lite TD Adidas.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garcia was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico when he came to the United States in 2000. His sons joined him in 2003. It took the boys two days and two nights to cross the border on foot. Mr. Garcia was working at a supermarket in Manhattan, but he soon had trouble keeping up with the rent, and later that year, they arrived at the Brooklyn shelter.\par \par \uc2 His former companion, the mother of the three boys, physically and verbally abused Mr. Garcia and the boys. Mr. Garcia said he was too scared to call the police because of his immigration status.\par \par \uc2 ''One night,'' Alan said, ''I was sleeping. She grabbed a knife and wanted to stab my dad in the chest. I got up. I put myself in front of my dad because I don't want him to go.'' Alan was 9 or 10 at the time.\par \par \uc2 In 2009, Mr. Garcia received a special visa, known as a U-visa, that is granted to victims of domestic violence and other crimes. He has been approved for a green card, which permits permanent residence in the United States. Once he receives a green card, he could be eligible for food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Angel will undergo surgery at the Shriners hospital in Philadelphia early next year. The hospital -- part of the Shriners Hospitals for Children, which are supported by the Shriners International fraternity -- is providing free care to Angel.\par \par \uc2 Life is hard for the Garcias, but not grim. They laugh a lot. One day they got caught in the rain in Central Park without an umbrella. They put the picture they took that day on the refrigerator. ''It's having fun with weather,'' Alan said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garcia sleeps on the sofa in the living room (Angel and Alberto share one bedroom, and Alan uses the other). He has skipped meals to make sure the boys have enough to eat. He has furnished the apartment with beds, cabinets and other items that were donated by friends and neighbors, or were discarded on the street.\par \par \uc2 At least one object in the living room was neither found nor donated, but earned: a trophy. It is a glass sculpture, given to Mr. Garcia last year at an event sponsored by city education officials in Brooklyn. It is chipped, but they are still proud of it. It says ''Father of the Year.''\par \par \uc2 HOW TO HELP: Checks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund may be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245. All gifts are acknowledged; special letters are not possible. A check intended for a particular agency should be written to and mailed to the agency, noting that it is a Neediest Cases gift.

PAGE A4\par \par \uc2 NATIONS WENT EASY ON CUBA\par \par \uc2 Many of the world's leading democracies, including Canada, Australia and Switzerland, avoid criticizing Cuba on human rights, content with pomp and photo ops, a document from the trove of cables made public by WikiLeaks says. PAGE A4\par \par \uc2 RICHARDSON IN PYONGYANG\par \par \uc2 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico met with North Korea's vice minister for American affairs on the first stop on a five-day private visit he said was aimed at conveying concerns about North Korean provocations and reducing tensions on the peninsula.

The bill faces a decisive vote in the Senate. PAGE A10\par \par \uc2 INCOME UP IN WASHINGTON\par \par \uc2 As incomes fell across America over the past decade, new census data show that one place registered a remarkable rise: Washington, D.C. The nation's capital, long a symbol of the country's urban ills, is now among the national leaders in income growth. PAGE A11\par \par \uc2 RESEARCH GUIDELINES ISSUED\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration has issued guidelines to insulate government scientific research from political meddling and to base policy decisions on solid data. Under the guidelines, government scientists could not be forbidden to speak to journalists and the public about their work, and agencies would be prohibited from editing or suppressing reports by independent advisory committees. PAGE A13\par \par \uc2 new york\par \par \uc2 TYPICAL DRUG CASE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADDRESS\par \par \uc2 Three drug dealers that catered to Ivy League clients were swept up in an undercover investigation by the police that began in the summer and culminated in the highly publicized arrests of five Columbia University students.

PAGE B1\par \par \uc2 A BIG CHILL FOR BEST BUY\par \par \uc2 At a time when the nation's brick-and-mortar electronics retailers are increasingly feeling the squeeze from online sellers and discounters, \uc2 Best Buy\uc2 , the world's largest consumer electronics retailer in revenue, reported that third-quarter net income fell 4.4 percent, to $217 million, and sales fell 1.1 percent, to $11.9 billion. PAGE B1\par \par \uc2 GOOGLE ANTITRUST INQUIRY\par \par \uc2 The European Commission has widened its investigation into \uc2 Google\uc2  by taking on two German cases involving complaints from a powerful group of newspaper and magazine publishers and an online mapping company, officials said. PAGE B2\par \par \uc2 PREFERRING PLASTIC TO PINE\par \par \uc2 Thinking they are helping the environment, Americans continue to buy fake Christmas trees, with sales expected to top 13 million this year, a new record. But a new study released by Ellipsos, an environmental consulting firm based in Montreal, makes a surprisingly strong case for natural trees. PAGE B4\par \par \uc2 sports\par \par \uc2 BRONCOS HIT BOTTOM, TAKE A CITY WITH THEM\par \par \uc2 In a city where football is king and John Elway is a god, Denver fans have found themselves in a foreign place: their beloved Broncos have imploded.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Obama administration joined with Latino leaders and immigrant advocates on Friday in a full-court press on behalf of a bill to grant legal status to hundreds of thousands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, which faces a decisive vote on Saturday in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, scheduled the vote on the student measure, which is known as the Dream Act, late on Thursday. The Senate will vote on a version of the bill that passed the House of Representatives on Dec. 8.\par \par \uc2 The bill gained some momentum after passing the House by 20 votes, including 8 Republicans, a wider margin than its supporters had expected. But on Friday the Senate count appeared to be short of the 60 votes Democrats need to bring the bill to the floor for debate. Its sponsors, including Senator Reid and Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second highest Democratic leader, acknowledged they faced an uphill climb.\par \par \uc2 President Obama made telephone calls this week to Republican and Democratic senators. Five cabinet secretaries have made calls, held news conferences or blogged on the issue.\par \par \uc2 On a call organized by the White House on Friday, David Aguilar, the deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said that strict eligibility requirements in the bill for young immigrants who are here would dissuade others outside the country from trying coming to the country illegally. Addressing concerns from lawmakers who say they want more border security before voting for the legislation, Mr. Aguilar said, ''At no point in history has the border been as secure as it is today.''\par \par \uc2 Latino leaders also turned up the pressure on senators, saying support for the student measure would be a litmus test for Latino voters in the 2012 elections.\par \par \uc2 ''This will be a watershed vote that Latinos will not forget,'' Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, one of the largest national Hispanic organizations, said on a conference call with reporters Friday. ''There will be members who choose to stand for innocent children and members who do not,'' she said, using some of the stark terms Latino leaders have adopted in the debate.\par \par \uc2 Latinos, the nation's largest and fastest-growing minority, registered more than one million voters in the past two election cycles. Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Reid, have said their party was able to keep its Senate majority due in large part to Latino voters.\par \par \uc2 The immigrant student measure has awakened powerful passions and led to national mobilizations on both sides of the debate. Republican opponents said the measure would encourage a new wave of illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 In this round of the fight, the supporters, led by \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, most of them Latinos, have been more visible than opponents. This week immigrant students, including many without legal status, lobbied in Senate offices in Washington. Univision and other Latino television networks have actively advocated for the student measure. Catholic, Jewish and evangelical Christian clergy members gathered on Capitol Hill this week to pray for passage of the bill.\par \par \uc2 Latino evangelical pastors, who are politically conservative on social issues, joined the campaign to pressure Republicans.\par \par \uc2 ''Republican conservatives have a chance to demonstrate they truly embrace the party of Lincoln,'' the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, said on a conference call Thursday. ''To continue to punish these children is nothing less than anti-Christian, anti-Hispanic and anti-American.''\par \par \uc2 Several Republicans face strong opposition from Republican voters in their states to measures that could be seen as rewarding immigrants who broke the law to remain in this country.\par \par \uc2 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, was one target of the advocates' campaign, with student protesters holding a month-long hunger strike at one of her Texas offices. Senator Hutchison said on Friday that she would not vote for the bill.\par \par \uc2 ''While she is sympathetic with their situation, she will not support the Dream Act legislation brought before the Senate because it expands the scope of the bill beyond the intended individuals who were brought here as children and grew up and were educated in the United States,'' a statement from her office said.\par \par \uc2 Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, another Republican who has been on call lists of Latino and immigrant groups, said this week that he would not vote for the bill, calling it a ''backdoor amnesty.'' Senator George LeMieux of Florida also said he would vote against the bill.\par \par \uc2 The bill would grant conditional legal status to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  high school graduates if they came to the United States before they were 16 years old, have been here for more than five years and have no criminal records, if they attend college or serve in the military for two years.\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: A prayer circle gathered at the Senate Hart Office Building in Washington.

Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Lawrenceville.   \par \uc2 2,923 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 December 2010\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDED\par \par \uc2 LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. -- It was just another suburban fender-bender. A car zoomed into an intersection and braked too late to stop at a red light. The Georgia woman driving it, an American citizen, left with a wrecked auto, a sore neck and a traffic fine.\par \par \uc2 But for Felipa Leonor Valencia, the Mexican woman who was driving the Jeep that was hit that day in March, the damage went far beyond a battered bumper. The crash led Ms. Valencia, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who did not have a valid driver's license, to 12 days in detention and the start of deportation proceedings -- after 17 years of living in Georgia.\par \par \uc2 Like Ms. Valencia, an estimated 4.5 million illegal immigrants nationwide are driving regularly, most without licenses, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Only three states -- New Mexico, Utah and Washington -- currently issue licenses without proof of legal residence in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Many states have adopted tough new laws to prevent illegal immigrants from driving, while expanding immigration enforcement by the state and local police. As a result, at least 30,000 illegal immigrants who were stopped for common traffic violations in the last three years have ended up in deportation, Department of Homeland Security figures show. The numbers are rapidly increasing, aggravating tensions in the national debate over immigration.\par \par \uc2 The tensions seem likely to persist. The Senate may take up a bill next week that would give legal status to some \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students. Its fate is uncertain, and prospects appear dim for a controversial overhaul, supported by President Obama, that would give legal status to 11 million illegal immigrants. In the absence of federal action, states are stepping in, trying their own solutions.\par \par \uc2 In Georgia, voters have been worried about unlicensed illegal immigrants whose driving skills are untested and who often lack insurance, including some who caused well-publicized accidents. Lawmakers have tightened requirements to keep illegal immigrants from obtaining licenses and license plates, and have increased penalties for driving without them.\par \par \uc2 ''There are certain things you can't do in the state of Georgia if you are an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ,'' said State Senator Chip Rogers, a Republican who was a prime mover behind some of the traffic measures. ''One of them is, you can't drive.''\par \par \uc2 Many Georgia counties have begun to cooperate formally with the Department of Homeland Security, so that illegal immigrants detained by the local police are turned over more consistently to federal immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 Still, according to The Times's analysis, 200,000 illegal immigrants in Georgia are driving to work daily. For them, the new laws mean that any police stop, whether for a violation that caused an accident, or for a broken taillight or another driver's mistake, can lead to deportation. Since 2006, thousands of immigrants, mostly from Latin America, have been deported from Georgia after traffic violations, often shaking up long-settled families.\par \par \uc2 The stepped-up enforcement has been applauded by many citizens. It has also antagonized the fast-growing Hispanic communities in and near Atlanta, where residents say the police are singling them out for traffic stops.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants say they continue to risk driving without a license in order to keep their jobs.\par \par \uc2 ''We have to work to support our kids, so we have to drive,'' Ms. Valencia said in Spanish, after she was released on a $7,500 bond in late October from an immigration detention center in Alabama to begin her legal fight against deportation. ''If we drive, we get stopped by the police. The first thing they ask is, 'Can I see your license?' 'Don't have one? Go to jail.' And from jail to deportation.''\par \par \uc2 A Sheriff Cracks Down\par \par \uc2 Not a few unlicensed Hispanic drivers are traveling the chronically congested roads here in Gwinnett County, a commuter destination northeast of Atlanta. Years of growth resulted in spreading subdivisions and state highways that converge at vast intersections. Public bus routes are few. To get around the county, you have to go by car.\par \par \uc2 After several high-profile crimes committed by illegal immigrants, the sheriff, Butch Conway, a blunt-spoken lawman who rides motorcycles and breeds horses in his spare time, made it his goal to reduce their population in his jail and his county.\par \par \uc2 ''Just the fact that these people committed serious crimes when they should not have been in the country to begin with,'' Sheriff Conway said, ''I think that was an insult to the people of Gwinnett.''\par \par \uc2 He enrolled the detention center here in Lawrenceville, the county seat, in a program with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency known as ICE. Under the program, known as 287 (g), 18 of his deputies were trained to question suspects about their immigration status when they arrive at the jail. The deputies place holds, known as detainers, on immigrants they determine to be here illegally, so when the inmates are released from the jail they can be turned over directly to ICE.\par \par \uc2 The agreement with ICE specifies that Sheriff Conway is to focus on removing ''criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety or a danger to the community.'' The sheriff says that should include those stopped for driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 ''I find it offensive that they just thumb their nose at our laws and operate vehicles they are not licensed to operate,'' he said, ''on top of the fact that they are here illegally.''\par \par \uc2 String of Violations\par \par \uc2 When some Gwinnett County residents explain why they support a crackdown on illegal immigrants, one case they cite is that of Celso Campos Duartes. Mr. Campos, a Mexican, accumulated at least five moving violations in five years, including a hit-and-run accident, before he was turned over to ICE for deportation last month through the county jail 287(g) program.\par \par \uc2 One afternoon in October 2005, Mr. Campos was driving his Ford compact down a county road just as Aubrey Sosebee, an 82-year-old retiree, reached the black mailbox at the end of his driveway.\par \par \uc2 ''The house sits way off the road, and that was his exercise every day, to walk up to get the mail and then walk back,'' said Rusty Sosebee, 59, one of Mr. Sosebee's sons.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Campos struck Mr. Sosebee, knocking him to the pavement. Witnesses told the police that Mr. Campos tried to turn his vehicle and leave but several drivers blocked his path. Mr. Campos sprinted into nearby woods, where police search dogs found him hours later.\par \par \uc2 Three of Mr. Sosebee's children, who gathered recently to recount the accident, could not recall the events without breaking down.\par \par \uc2 ''He knows all of the illegal actions that he has taken,'' Rhonda Neely, 49, Mr. Sosebee's daughter, said of Mr. Campos. ''He's more concerned with getting away and not getting caught than with my dad's life, laying there on the road, the person he just ran over.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Campos, though sober, was driving without a license and with plates from another vehicle. Although insurance is mandatory in Georgia, he had none. Mr. Sosebee received no compensation from Mr. Campos for his medical care.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sosebee never recovered from the head injury he suffered in the fall, his son Rusty said. He remained disoriented, his son said, and four months later he died.\par \par \uc2 Convicted of leaving the scene of an accident, Mr. Campos served 26 months in the county jail. But at the end of his sentence, he walked away. He was arrested two more times for traffic offenses.\par \par \uc2 After the Sosebees learned in May, to their disbelief, that Mr. Campos was still in the country, they contacted the news media. The furor ensured that ICE would not let Mr. Campos slip away again.\par \par \uc2 In an interview in October in the Gwinnett County Detention Center, Mr. Campos, now 37, was impassive and unapologetic. ''I ran to protect my life,'' he said, speaking in Spanish at a jailhouse visiting booth. ''The accident had already happened, there was nothing I could do to avoid it.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Campos did not dispute his eventual deportation. The residents of Georgia ''have every right to object to people who drive without a license.''\par \par \uc2 Making Their Arguments\par \par \uc2 While traffic deaths involving illegal immigrants like Mr. Campos have galvanized public opinion, it is not clear that they are increasing, even as the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population has surged during the last decade.\par \par \uc2 There has been no surge in the percentage of Hispanic drivers killed in accidents in recent years, federal highway safety data show. What the data do show is that Hispanics who are involved in fatal crashes are far less likely than other drivers to have a valid license.\par \par \uc2 About 80 percent of illegal immigrants are Hispanic, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group.\par \par \uc2 Looming over cases like Mr. Campos's is the question of whether illegal immigrants should be allowed to have driver's licenses in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Highway safety and auto insurance experts argue that licensing requires drivers to pass tests and creates an official record of their performance on the road. Licensed drivers can also be made to buy insurance.\par \par \uc2 ''When you are licensed, you have proven you have some ability to drive and know the basic safety rules,'' said David Snyder, vice president of the American Insurance Association.\par \par \uc2 Opponents focus on a different set of issues, arguing that a license is an identity document that allows unauthorized immigrants to move about the country freely and to gain public benefits.\par \par \uc2 ''Giving someone here illegally a driver's license is much more than giving them the privilege of driving,'' said D. A. King, president of the Dustin Inman Society, a group created in the name of a Georgia teenager who was killed in 2000 by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  driver. ''It is giving them the keys to the kingdom.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. King's side is winning. Since 2006, six states that once allowed illegal immigrants to obtain licenses have changed their laws, leaving only three. Susana Martinez, the Republican governor-elect of New Mexico, has pledged to revise license laws there to deny licenses to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Georgia has never given licenses to immigrants who are here illegally. In 2008, state legislators increased the penalties for driving without a license, starting with 48 hours of mandatory jail time for a first offense and fines amounting to $700.\par \par \uc2 Now, many more unlicensed immigrants are going to jail -- and from there are being detained by immigration authorities. Some are offenders like Mr. Campos. Many others are average drivers like Ms. Valencia.\par \par \uc2 Wrong Place, Wrong Time\par \par \uc2 ''I would like to be able to get a license, but I am unable to do so,'' Ms. Valencia told a state judge, speaking through an interpreter in Spanish, when she appeared on Oct. 6 in a Lawrenceville courtroom for the no-license citation she received at the accident scene.\par \par \uc2 On March 11, the day the speeding Chevy hit Ms. Valencia's vehicle, she was barely a mile from the home she owns in a Gwinnett County development. She was on her way to pick up her daughter, Crystal, 16, at high school to take her to a doctor's appointment.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Valencia's 2000 Jeep Cherokee was legally registered, inspected and insured. She had a driver's license she had obtained in North Carolina in 2003, when that state still granted them without proof of United States residency. It expired in 2008.\par \par \uc2 After coming to Georgia from an ox-and-plow farming village in Mexico, Ms. Valencia had a 12-year career at a fast-food restaurant in a suburban mall, rising from hamburger flipper to cashier to assistant manager. Among her most carefully preserved possessions are two diplomas for the company's management training courses.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Valencia, a single mother, has raised Crystal, an American citizen born in Atlanta, and an American niece, now 7, whose mother died in childbirth.\par \par \uc2 With the help of a lawyer, Ms. Valencia navigated the court hearing and was ready to pay her fine and go home. But at the last minute, the judge ordered her to be fingerprinted at the Gwinnett County Detention Center.\par \par \uc2 ''Oh, no, my God, that's it,'' she thought. ''I'm going to jail.''\par \par \uc2 When she arrived to give her fingerprints, a 287(g) deputy asked for her immigration papers. When she had none to offer, she was sent to immigration detention in Gadsden, Ala.\par \par \uc2 Crystal was distraught, frantically texting her mother and scouring the county court Web site for information.\par \par \uc2 ''She is the only person that's been there for me,'' Crystal said, dazed, at a relative's house one night while her mother was in the county jail. ''She shows me what decisions to make, like keep going to school, do good in school, don't drop out.''\par \par \uc2 Crystal has been preparing to go to college to study medicine, and she could not conceive of moving to Mexico. ''To begin with,'' she said, ''I really don't know that much Spanish.''\par \par \uc2 The Repercussions\par \par \uc2 ''I think there's some sad stories out there, no doubt,'' Sheriff Conway said. ''But my job is not taking action on sad stories.''\par \par \uc2 To date, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has signed agreements for 287(g) programs with 72 communities across the country. It is also rolling out a more ambitious program called Secure Communities, giving local police nationwide access to the Department of Homeland Security's database of fingerprints. Immigrants are checked for their legal status when they are booked.\par \par \uc2 Senior ICE officials have established priorities for these programs, with the highest being deportation of criminals convicted of major drug offenses and violent acts. Traffic violations are not among the top priorities.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Conway takes a different position: ''If they're here illegally in the United States, they should be deported regardless of the charge.''\par \par \uc2 The results of the Gwinnett County 287(g) program reflect the sheriff's view. During its first year, which ended Nov. 16, immigration detainers were placed on 3,034 inmates, 93 percent of them Latino. Of a total of 6,662 charges those inmates faced, 21 percent were for ICE's high-priority crimes, like aggravated assault and child molestation. But 45 percent were for traffic violations other than driving under the influence, including 469 detainees held only for driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 The impact in this area has been deep. Vanessa Kosky, the defense lawyer who represented Ms. Valencia, said her young practice has been overwhelmed with cases of Hispanic immigrants arrested for driving without a license. To avoid deportation, they have clogged the courts to fight charges they once would have dispatched by paying a fine.\par \par \uc2 ''These are not horrific drivers,'' Ms. Kosky said. ''These are not D.U.I.'s. These are not people who are putting people in danger.''\par \par \uc2 Hispanic leaders said immigrants are learning to avoid the police. Latino restaurants have lost business as their patrons choose to stay home. Attendance at Catholic churches dropped when police set up traffic checkpoints nearby.\par \par \uc2 ''It's like a persecution,'' said Bishop Luis Rafael Zarama, the auxiliary bishop of Atlanta. ''These laws only affect one group: the Latino community.''\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement officials point to a sharp drop this year in arrests for driving without a license. Some unlicensed immigrants are car-pooling, and some are moving elsewhere in Georgia.\par \par \uc2 ''I mean, that's success,'' Sheriff Conway said. ''That's the point of the program, to remove illegal aliens from Gwinnett County.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: December 17, 2010, Friday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A map last Friday with an article about the tensions arising nationwide because of illegal immigrants who drive without licenses erroneously labeled West Virginia as Maryland and omitted the percentage of Hispanic drivers killed in crashes in West Virginia from 2000-2009 who did not have licenses. It was 21 percent. (Though the map did not label Maryland, it correctly noted that the figure there was 23 percent .)\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: ENFORCER: After some crimes by illegal immigrants caused an outcry, Sheriff Butch Conway of Gwinnett County, Ga., made it a goal to reduce their numbers and enrolled the jail in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement program.; DETAINED: Felipa Leonor Valencia, a Gwinnett County homeowner from Mexico facing deportation, was reunited in October with her daughter, Crystal, 16, left, and niece Stephanie, 7.

LESSER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A20)\par \par \uc2 MAP: Unlicensed Drivers and Fatal Crashes: There are no precise statistics on illegal immigrants who drive. But the government compiles information on the license status and ethnicity of drivers killed in accidents. According to that data, Hispanic drivers killed in crashes are disproportionately unlicensed, particularly in Southern states where illegal immigration surged in the last decade. About 80 percent of illegal immigrants are Hispanic. (Sources: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (unlicensed drivers involved in fatal crashes); Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office); GRAPHICS: A Gwinnett County Snapshot: In Gwinnett County, Ga., immigrants arrested for unlicensed driving are being detained for deportation. A disproportionate share of those detained under a federal immigration program in the last year were Hispanic, and nearly half the charges they faced were for traffic violations.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A bill to grant legal status to hundreds of thousands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students passed the House of Representatives late Wednesday, giving President Obama an unexpected although largely symbolic victory in the final days of Democratic control of Congress on an issue he has called a top priority.\par \par \uc2 The bill, known as the Dream Act, passed the House by a vote of 216 to 198. But a vote in the Senate on opening debate on the bill was scheduled for Thursday, and the measure seemed likely to fail there.\par \par \uc2 Still, Democratic leaders celebrated the House vote, which gave them a triumph in the final days of the Congressional session before they yield the majority next year to Republicans. It also gave them something to show Hispanic voters, who strongly support the measure and could play a pivotal role in the 2012 presidential election.\par \par \uc2 The measure was supported by eight Republicans, including three Cuban-American representatives from South Florida, Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Thirty-eight Democrats voted against it.\par \par \uc2 Democrats supported it as a way to help young immigrants who were brought here illegally as children by their parents and have seen their lives stall after they graduate from high school because they lack legal status.\par \par \uc2 ''They are American in everything but a piece of paper,'' said Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, perhaps the bill's most fervent champion.\par \par \uc2 Republicans said the bill was amnesty for lawbreakers that would lead to a new wave of illegal immigration. They objected to expedited procedures Democratic leaders used to bring it to a vote with only one day's notice.\par \par \uc2 Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, said the bill ''encourages fraud and more illegal immigration on a massive scale.'' He said the rush to a vote was ''a desecration of the democratic process.''\par \par \uc2 The House passage drew cheers from \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, who have shown support in marches, sit-in protests and hunger strikes, even sending their blood to lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 With Republicans holding a majority in the House and added strength in the Senate in the new Congress, the chances for any legislation legalizing illegal immigrants are dim.\par \par \uc2 In a last-minute press, President Obama made calls this week to undecided lawmakers from both parties, White House officials said. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and senior Pentagon officials spoke publicly to argue that the bill would create new taxpayers and help military readiness.\par \par \uc2 The bill, whose lead sponsor was Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of California, would give conditional legal status to illegal immigrants who came to the United States before they were 16, have been here for five years, have graduated from high school and have no criminal record, if they attend college or serve in the military for two years.\par \par \uc2 In a report issued Wednesday, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that the House bill would reduce the federal deficit by $2.2 billion before 2020, but it could lead to costly health care and federal loan expenditures in the decade after that.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020101209e6c900056\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

PAGE A12\par \par \uc2 NARROWING CLIMATE DIVIDE\par \par \uc2 The United States and China have significantly narrowed their differences on the verification of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, officials said, providing hope that a United Nations conference on climate change can achieve some modest success.

PAGE A18\par \par \uc2 TALK OF PRIMARY CHALLENGE\par \par \uc2 President Obama's compromise with Republicans on extending tax cuts for the wealthy, which his self-described progressive critics see as a profound betrayal, is bound to intensify a debate that has been bubbling up on liberal blogs and e-mail lists in recent weeks -- whether the president who embodied ''hope and change'' in 2008 should face a primary challenge in 2012. Matt Bai, Political Times. PAGE A22\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA STUDENTS CHARGED\par \par \uc2 With Felony Drug Sales\par \par \uc2 Five Columbia students were arrested and charged with felony drug sales, along with three people accused of being their suppliers. The arrests followed an undercover investigation, called Operation Ivy League by the police and prosecutors, in which officers made nearly $11,000 in drug purchases from the students, the police said. PAGE A27\par \par \uc2 Business\par \par \uc2 AT CNN, TENSIONS\par \par \uc2 On Talk Show\par \par \uc2 In one sweeping move, the 8 p.m. political talk show ''Parker Spitzer'' could have turned around CNN's flailing prime-time ratings. Instead, two months later, the ratings for CNN's latest experiment are stagnant, and the show has been troubled by backstage tensions. PAGE B1\par \par \uc2 PACT WILL CREATE FEW JOBS\par \par \uc2 A revised free-trade agreement with South Korea has gotten acclaim from corporate leaders and Congressional Republicans, but is likely to result in little if any net job creation in the short run, according to Washington's own analysis. PAGE B3\par \par \uc2 DELAY ON BAILOUT AID\par \par \uc2 Fighting to support the euro amid continuing market uncertainty, European finance ministers played for time, making no pledge to increase their backstop fund for the currency and hinting that Portugal might need to take more measures to fend off speculative attacks. PAGE B4\par \par \uc2 Sports\par \par \uc2 AFTER BLOWOUT LOSS,\par \par \uc2 Jets Face Defining Stretch\par \par \uc2 This season, the Jets have won three times for every game they have lost. But in four contests against teams with winning records, they have fallen three times, including a 45-3 dismantling by the Patriots on national television this week. Now they must prove they are as good as Coach Rex Ryan has led them and the public to believe. PAGE B14\par \par \uc2 Arts\par \par \uc2 BOOK TRANSLATIONS\par \par \uc2 As Literary Diplomacy\par \par \uc2 Among foreign cultural institutes and publishers, the traditional American aversion to literature in translation is known as ''the 3 percent problem'' -- in reference to its miniscule share of the American book market. But foreign governments and foundations, especially those on the margins of Europe, are taking matters into their own hands and plunging into the publishing fray in the United States.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc93}{\*\bkmkend toc93}\b \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Students Await Votes on Legal Status\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON   \par \uc2 918 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 December 2010\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 With both houses of Congress set to vote this week on a bill that would give legal status to hundreds of thousands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, one of those students will wait for news of the outcome at an immigration detention center in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The student, Hector Lopez, 21, was deported to Mexico in August after having lived with his family in Oregon since he was an infant. After two months of trying to find his bearings and a job in Mexico City, Mr. Lopez, who does not speak Spanish, traveled to the border last month and turned himself in to the immigration authorities, requesting asylum in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lopez's deportation and effort to return offer a look at one prospect awaiting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students if the bill, known as the Dream Act, fails.\par \par \uc2 Votes on the measure were expected in the Senate and the House on Wednesday, Congressional leaders said. It stands a slim chance of passage in the House, where Democrats are in the final days of their majority. In the Senate, although its champion is the Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, the bill appears unlikely to succeed.\par \par \uc2 Many Republican senators, led by Jeff Sessions of Alabama, have denounced the bill as a ''nightmare act'' that would give amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants and provide safe harbor for some with criminal records. Other Republicans, including several who supported the bill in the past, said they would not vote for it this time because they believe Democrats are pushing it to please Latino voters.\par \par \uc2 In demonstrations this year in support of the bill, hundreds of immigrant students declared their illegal status and thousands joined street protests. Young illegal immigrants like Mr. Lopez are regularly caught in sweeps by immigration agents.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration, which supports the measure, said it has steered away from arresting illegal immigrants who might be eligible for legal status under its terms, with officials saying their focus was on deporting convicted criminals. Still, Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary, said that immigration authorities would deport any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  they detected.\par \par \uc2 ''Our job is to enforce the law, and we are going to continue to do our job,'' Ms. Napolitano told reporters last week.\par \par \uc2 On Sept. 1, Mr. Lopez was flown by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the Texas border and deported to Matamoros, Mexico. He and his parents were arrested on Aug. 23 near their home in Milwaukie, Ore., by agents with a court order for their deportation issued in April 1999, when Mr. Lopez was 9. Mr. Lopez and his parents, who are also illegal immigrants from Mexico, said in court papers that they did not receive the notice to attend an immigration hearing the previous month.\par \par \uc2 When they failed to appear, the judge ordered them deported. The lawyer who represented them was later suspended from practice for three years, in part for failing to notify clients of immigration hearings, according to a 2002 ruling by the State Bar Court of California.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lopez's parents brought him to the United States when he was 6 weeks old. In his senior year at Rex Putnam High School, he was student body president, graduating in 2008. Mr. Lopez would have been eligible for legal status under the student bill, since he was a child when he was ordered deported, his lawyer, Siovhan Sheridan-Ayala, said.\par \par \uc2 With no immediate relatives in Mexico, Mr. Lopez traveled by bus from the border to Mexico City, to stay in the home of distant family friends in Iztapalapa, a working-class district.\par \par \uc2 Speaking by telephone from the detention center in Florence, Ariz., Mr. Lopez said he always felt out of place in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 ''I felt like everything was far from home, just a completely new world for me,'' he said. ''Not knowing the language well, I wasn't ready for it all. It was almost too much to handle.''\par \par \uc2 He said that a local gang of drug dealers harassed him, trying to drive him out of the neighborhood. For several weeks he did not leave his residence, until he decided to try to return to the United States. Ms. Sheridan-Ayala has initiated an asylum petition and asked to re-open his deportation case.\par \par \uc2 The student bill would provide conditional legal status to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  high school graduates who came to the country before they were 16 years old, have lived here for five years and have no criminal records, if they attend college or serve in the military for two years.\par \par \uc2 In a final-hour press by the administration, Clifford L. Stanley, the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, said Tuesday in a call with reporters that the bill would help the Pentagon by ''increasing the pool of high-quality people who are going to be enlisting.''\par \par \uc2 The lead sponsor of the Senate bill, Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, made changes to it in an effort to attract more votes, lowering the maximum age for eligibility to 29 from 35, and tightening the exclusion of immigrants with criminal records.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Sessions, in a speech on the Senate floor, said that the bill remained ''poorly drafted, filled with loopholes and, by rewarding illegal behavior, will without doubt encourage future illegal immigration.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: Hector Lopez, in a 2008 Oregon school photo, was deported to Mexico in August and is seeking asylum in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020101208e6c80002p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It was a midmorning in early September when two strawberry pickers at a Watsonville farm were struck by an odor wafting from an overgrown ditch.\par \par \uc2 The source of the smell was an anonymous body. The man, who the authorities suspected was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , had been killed and dumped along a curve on the farm's dirt road. Some parts of his body, including his skull with a set of crooked teeth, had survived the weeks of decomposition, but detectives could not determine his identity. So they called Gloria Nusse, a forensic artist in Mill Valley, to bring a face back into view.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Nusse measured the man's skull and formed a resin casting, gliding her practiced fingers over the replica with strips of mud-colored clay, smoothing out the ridges and lines. Twelve millimeters here, over his chin; five millimeters there, over his forehead. Slowly, measurements and equations and anatomical arrangements became his nose, eyes and mouth. His face. And a slight, crowded smile.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Nusse's work is not new. Facial reconstruction after death is an ancient art, dating to the mortuary rituals of Jericho in 7000 B.C. and the funerary masks of the Egyptians. But in California, with the highest population of illegal immigrants in the country, Ms. Nusse's works of art have begun to serve another purpose. Unrecognized in many respects during life in the United States, the invisible, in her hands, become visible.\par \par \uc2 ''That's the untold story of this,'' Ms. Nusse said recently from her office at San Francisco State University, where she teaches anatomy. ''People -- they can disappear.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Nusse's most recent case was the John Doe from Watsonville in Santa Cruz County, where more than a quarter of the population is Hispanic and where the mountainous terrain and sprawling farmland serve as convenient dumping grounds for anonymous bodies. Detectives there say that in the last three years they have found the remains of three unidentified Hispanic males who they believe were illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 While the police can often use missing-person reports and dental records or DNA to confirm identities, those whose ties and origins are in another country, and particularly those who live in secrecy from the government here, leave far fewer clues.\par \par \uc2 In Watsonville, this is what detectives knew when they sent the case to Ms. Nusse: The man died a violent death two to four weeks before Sept. 9, when he was found. He was 18 to 25 years old, according to dental examinations, and 4 feet 8 inches tall. A forensic anthropologist determined, based on bone structure and other characteristics, that he was probably of Oaxacan descent. And he had crooked teeth.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Nusse got to work.\par \par \uc2 On each skull, she marks more than 20 spots with needles of different heights, indicating tissue depth. She calculates the protrusion of the nose by measuring the angles of the nasal spine and cavity. She forms the gumline by noting the start of the enamel, and the width of the lips by their proportion to the eye sockets.\par \par \uc2 ''You really have to understand the anatomy,'' she said. ''That's really key to this work: knowing how to read the skull.''\par \par \uc2 At the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office, Ms. Nusse's services, at about $2,000 per case, used to be viewed as a last resort. But Sgt. Alan Burt said the sculptures cost less than some tests and were often more valuable; a family member or friend in Mexico is much more likely to recognize a clay model than a description or a sketch.\par \par \uc2 ''This way we can get a clear copy of what the face looks like, and we can get it on the news,'' Sergeant Burt said.\par \par \uc2 Sgt. Scott Dudek of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office recalled one of Ms. Nusse's earlier cases. A young woman's body had been found in 2003 behind a Castro Valley restaurant. Three years later, still stumped for an identity, detectives hired Ms. Nusse.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's office worked with the Mexican Consulate to spread information about the case. In Yahualica, Mexico, former high school classmates immediately recognized Ms. Nusse's sculpture as Yesenia Nungaray, who was 16 in 2003 when she left home with an older man. Yesenia's mother also recognized her likeness, and provided detectives with DNA to confirm the teenager's identity.\par \par \uc2 ''The result was just phenomenal,'' Sergeant Dudek said. ''What she looked like and what Gloria thought she looked like were unbelievably close.''\par \par \uc2 Though no one has been charged in Yesenia's death, identifying a previously unidentified body is crucial in a criminal investigation. And for Ms. Nusse, the experience is emotionally gratifying.\par \par \uc2 ''Yesenia's mother had no idea where she was,'' she said. ''To know that I helped a person get their loved one returned to them -- I find comfort in that.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Nusse began her career illustrating textbooks and creating museum exhibitions. Her fine-arts education placed an emphasis on human anatomy, eventually leading to her first job as a forensic artist in 2000. She has done 17 facial reconstructions, leading to nine positive identifications.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Nusse's most recent John Doe sculpture now sits atop a shelf in a small office in Santa Cruz. His eyes are dark, his brown hair is cropped short and his mouth is twisted into a subtle smile. A news conference featuring the sculpture was held in October, but no useful information emerged. Detectives now plan to send photographs of the sculpture to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 ''Every skull is different. Every skull is unique,'' Ms. Nusse said, imagining John Doe's face during a recent interview in her San Francisco office. ''This young man from Oaxaca, nobody knows very much about him. Except he has these teeth.''\par \par \uc2 She tries to emphasize each person's unique traits in her sculptures, Ms. Nusse said, but every time she finishes a piece, she is plagued by doubts. She wonders if John Doe actually liked to smile. Before detectives identified Yesenia, Ms. Nusse worried that she had made the teenager ''too pretty.''\par \par \uc2 And the sculptures do not capture gestures or personalities. Such details are the domain of the living. If the case goes unsolved, they may remain mysteries forever.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Nusse remains hopeful about John Doe.\par \par \uc2 ''You know, I think he's very cute. He has this funny grin on his face. It's making him look like he's trying to say something to you,'' she said, smiling. ''Maybe that's good.''\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Building a face on a John Doe skull from Marin County is the latest project for the forensic artist Gloria Nusse.; Yesenia Nungaray, left, was identified by former classmates in Mexico after they saw Ms. Nusse's reconstruction of a murder victim's face, right.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano called on Congress on Thursday to pass a bill granting legal status to thousands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, saying it would help immigration authorities focus their resources on deporting dangerous criminals. In a telephone call organized by the White House, Ms. Napolitano told reporters that the students who would benefit ''have no fault for being here in the United States'' because they were brought here as children. ''No one who poses a threat to public safety will be able to adjust their immigration status,'' she said, under a revised version of the bill, known as the Dream Act, which was introduced Tuesday. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a Republican who is a leading opponent, said he would resist it ''with every strength and every ability that I have.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020101203e6c300061\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

But the intensified training has been marred by at least six cases in the last 13 months in which soldiers or police officers have turned their guns on their Western partners.

They are mostly heterosexuals who have not lost friends or family members to the disease, but have witnessed the epidemic's toll during summers or semesters abroad. PAGE A14\par \par \uc2 PUSH ON IMMIGRANT BILL\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocate groups have mobilized across the country in what they call a last-ditch effort to persuade Congress to pass a bill, which they call the Dream Act, that would grant legal status to hundreds of thousands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, pressing for action in the remaining weeks when Democrats control both houses of Congress.

The new jobs are the latest commitment by G.M. to broaden its lineup of energy-efficient models as well as to invest in its home state, which has the nation's second-highest unemployment rate.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocate groups have mobilized across the country in what they call a last-ditch effort to persuade Congress to pass a bill that would grant legal status to hundreds of thousands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, pressing for action in the remaining weeks when Democrats control both houses of Congress.\par \par \uc2 The groups held marches, hunger strikes, prayer vigils and protests at lawmakers' offices on Monday and Tuesday in support of the bill, which they call the Dream Act. Opponents are also in high gear, swamping some senators who have not disclosed their positions with faxes and phone calls.\par \par \uc2 A vote on the bill has not been scheduled, but Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has said he could bring it up as early as this week. While its prospects do not look strong, both sides expect that any measure to legalize illegal immigrants would have far slimmer chances in Congress next year, when Republicans will have a majority in the House and increased strength in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 ''We see this as our best opportunity now to get something done,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a group that favors the bill.\par \par \uc2 ''Since they are giving it everything, so are we,'' said Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, which seeks reduced immigration and opposes the student bill. He said his group had delivered more than 650,000 faxes to lawmakers in recent days.\par \par \uc2 ''We think if we beat this one we won't have to deal with amnesty for many years to come,'' Mr. Beck said, referring to legalization legislation.\par \par \uc2 At the San Antonio offices of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, 15 protesters supporting the bill were arrested Monday night, charged with trespassing. In a statement, Ms. Hutchison, a Republican, said that she had asked that the students be escorted from her office without arrests, but that they had resisted.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hutchison does not support the student bill in its current form, the statement said.\par \par \uc2 In California on Tuesday, caravans of students, immigrants and labor union members stopped at offices across the state of eight Republican and four Democratic House members, demanding that they declare support for the legislation. An estimated 550,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students in California could be eligible for legal status under the bill, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group.\par \par \uc2 In Washington State, immigrant and farm worker groups demonstrated outside the offices of Republican House members. In Washington, D.C., \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students marched into an Army recruiting station and asked to enlist. Immigrants who lack legal status are currently prohibited from joining the armed forces.\par \par \uc2 University presidents in the Northeast and Illinois signed letters of support or attended campus rallies, including leaders at Brown, Harvard, M.I.T. and Northwestern. A coalition of immigrant groups and unions announced a radio and print advertising campaign this week focused on undecided senators from five states.\par \par \uc2 In the past the bill has enjoyed broader support than other immigration measures because it would benefit young people who were brought to this country illegally by their parents and have generally performed well in school. It would open a path to legal status for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  high school graduates who came to the United States before they were 16 years old, have been here for at least five years and have no criminal record, provided they complete two years of college or military service.\par \par \uc2 But prayers and demonstrations did not appear to be attracting any swell of support to the bill. One of its firmest adversaries, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, took the lead in marshaling opposition, sending out action alerts detailing a 10-point critique of the bill. He said it would give safe harbor to some immigrants with criminal records and could benefit illegal immigrants who were no longer youths.\par \par \uc2 Senator Reid is fulfilling a promise from his recent re-election campaign by bringing up the student bill for a vote. His re-election victory came in large part from Latino votes. President Obama has said he wants to see the bill passed now, and Arne Duncan, his secretary of education, has been promoting it in public appearances.\par \par \uc2 ''I think we are fundamentally wrong on this as a nation,'' Mr. Duncan said in a call Monday with reporters. \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  students ''have played by all the rules, gone to school, worked hard, full attendance. Then they graduate and the doors of opportunity basically slam shut,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 But Republican lawmakers seemed in no hurry to give the Democrats a triumph during the lame-duck session. Some of the protests in support of the bill took place at the Utah offices of Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican who was one of the first sponsors of the bill, early in the decade.\par \par \uc2 ''Knowing full well it won't become law, Democrats are cynically using this legislation for political purposes to curry favor with a political constituency,'' said Antonia Ferrier, his spokeswoman. She said Mr. Hatch wanted to focus in the current session on tax-cut legislation and other economic issues.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Protesters marched into an Army recruiting station in Washington on Tuesday.

All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- A jury convicted a Salvadoran immigrant of killing Chandra Levy, the government intern whose relationship with Gary A. Condit ended his Congressional career and made her disappearance a national media sensation.\par \par \uc2 Ingmar Guandique, a 29-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was convicted of first-degree murder in the killing of Ms. Levy, 24, who vanished on May 1, 2001. Her body was found a year later in Rock Creek Park here.\par \par \uc2 Investigators initially focused on Mr. Condit, a Democrat who represented California's 18th Congressional District. But they eventually concluded that he was not involved, and the case went cold. The negative publicity hurt the re-election bid of Mr. Condit, who was married at the time.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Condit, who now lives in Arizona, has refused to say whether he had an extramarital affair with Ms. Levy. He has long denied any involvement in her death.\par \par \uc2 The case dragged on for years with no leads but was resurrected in 2009, when investigators charged Mr. Guandique, who was serving time for attacks on other women in the same park around the time Ms. Levy disappeared.\par \par \uc2 Speaking outside the courthouse on Monday, the District of Columbia police chief, Cathy L. Lanier, said investigators and detectives never gave up. The case had put intense pressure on the Police Department, though it was eclipsed by the Sept. 11 attacks and the Washington-area sniper shootings.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not like it is on TV,'' Chief Lanier said. ''Cases can be very complicated,'' she said, adding that detectives ''can sometimes discover things that were not discoverable at the beginning.''\par \par \uc2 At the heart of the prosecution's case was testimony from an inmate, Armando Morales. He had served time with Mr. Guandique and said Mr. Guandique had confessed to killing Ms. Levy.\par \par \uc2 At the time of the trial, which lasted about a month, Mr. Guandique was serving sentences for attacks on women in the park in May and July of 2001. Women from those attacks testified. In each case, he grabbed the victim from around the neck at knifepoint, the United States attorney's office in the District of Columbia said, but the women struggled and escaped.\par \par \uc2 The women's testimony seemed to have been persuasive for jurors in a trial that otherwise offered little in the way of forensic evidence.\par \par \uc2 ''It would have been hard for anyone in that courtroom not to be moved,'' said Susan Kelly, a juror, referring to the testimony of the women joggers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Guandique's sentence was coming to a close for those crimes, and he was due to be released at the end of this year. Now he faces 30 years to life for the conviction in Ms. Levy's case, which includes kidnapping and attempted robbery counts.\par \par \uc2 ''Today's verdict sends a message that it's never too late for justice to be served,'' said Ronald C. Machen Jr., the United States attorney for the District of Columbia.\par \par \uc2 Judge Gerald I. Fisher of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia set Mr. Guandique's sentencing for Feb. 11.\par \par \uc2 Susan Levy, Ms. Levy's mother, exhaled audibly as Judge Fisher repeated the verdict, craning her head to get a glimpse of Mr. Guandique, whose face remained expressionless. He was wearing a blue turtleneck to cover gang tattoos, a gray sweater vest and headphones that translated the proceedings into Spanish.\par \par \uc2 ''The result of this verdict may be guilty,'' Ms. Levy said shortly after the verdict, ''but I have a life sentence of a lost limb missing from our family tree.''\par \par \uc2 Defense lawyers argued during the trial that Mr. Morales was trying to get in the good graces of prosecutors, according to The Associated Press, and that his account was concocted.\par \par \uc2 There were no eyewitnesses or DNA evidence linking Mr. Guandique to Ms. Levy, and the only piece of actual proof -- DNA on Ms. Levy's running tights -- did not belong to Mr. Guandique.\par \par \uc2 The Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia, which represented Mr. Guandique, did not return calls for comment. Mr. Condit's lawyer, Bertram Fields, responded to calls on Monday.\par \par \uc2 ''Who gives him his career back?'' Mr. Fields said. ''That career has been destroyed and his life turned upside down, and that will never change.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Condit was a seven-term representative and a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He sued several journalists over their coverage and ''had a successful outcome'' in at least one case, Mr. Fields said. He declined to provide details, citing a nondisclosure agreement in the case.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Chandra Levy vanished in 2001, and Ingmar Guandique was convicted of killing her.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc99}{\*\bkmkend toc99}\b \uc2 Court Backs \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Students\b0\par\par\uc2 By IAN LOVETT   \par \uc2 533 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 November 2010\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES -- In a unanimous decision, the California Supreme Court ruled Monday that illegal immigrants can be eligible for the same reduced tuition at public colleges and universities as legal residents of the state.\par \par \uc2 The ruling is the latest in a series of high-profile battles about state immigration policies. In addition to Arizona's strict new immigration law, which the United States Department of Justice has challenged in court, nine other states have laws similar to California's, with lawsuits pending in Nebraska and Texas.\par \par \uc2 Currently, students who attend at least three years of high school in California and graduate are eligible for in-state tuition at public schools, which can save them as much as $12,000 a year compared with students who come from other states.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants remain ineligible for state or federal financial aid.\par \par \uc2 The California court ruled that the 2001 state law does not conflict with a federal prohibition on education benefits for illegal immigrants based on residency, in part because United States citizens from other states who attend high school in California may also benefit.\par \par \uc2 ''It cannot be the case that states may never give a benefit to unlawful aliens without giving the same benefit to all American citizens,'' wrote Justice Ming W. Chin, one of the court's more conservative justices, in the court's opinion.\par \par \uc2 Kris Kobach, the legal scholar who helped draft Arizona's immigration law, argued the case on behalf of American citizens from other states who were not eligible for reduced tuition -- his latest effort to enact tough illegal immigration policies in states across the country. He said his side would appeal the ruling to the United States Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 ''I think the pendulum is definitely swinging in favor of enforcement of the law and discouraging illegal immigration,'' Mr. Kobach said. ''I am confident this is not the last word on the subject.''\par \par \uc2 In California, Latinos now make up more than half of all students in public schools, according to the State Department of Education, and strong support from Latinos helped Democrats here fare better than they did in most other states in this year's midterm elections.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of immigration overhaul hope that legislation that would offer some \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students access to federal financial aid and a path toward citizenship will be taken up again in the lame-duck session of Congress that convened Monday.\par \par \uc2 ''This law makes higher education affordable for so many students who have the added difficulty of not being eligible for federal financial aid,'' said Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ''If they are both ineligible for aid and then face higher tuition rates, it becomes virtually impossible for students to go on to higher education.''\par \par \uc2 Kevin R. Johnson, dean of the law school at the University of California, Davis, said that the ruling might discourage future lawsuits in other states with similar laws, but that litigation about students who are illegal immigrants would continue.\par \par \uc2 ''This issue is not going to go away,'' Professor Johnson said. ''It's going to require some Congressional action.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020101116e6bg0004k\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15
