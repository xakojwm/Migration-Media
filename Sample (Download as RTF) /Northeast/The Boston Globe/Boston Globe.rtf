Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Lawyers for a group of taxpayers are asking the state's highest court to nullify agreements with \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  that allow local sheriffs' offices to identify, arrest, and transport undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A lawsuit filed Monday against Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald Jr. alleges that his office's agreement with ICE is unlawful because it devotes state resources to federal civil immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is nothing in the state constitution, statute, or common law that grants Massachusetts sheriffs the power to enter into such agreements," according to the lawsuit, filed by the Lawyers for Civil Rights on behalf of 28 taxpayers, including Juan Cofield, president of the New England chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\par \par \uc2 A sheriff's power is narrow, \u8220\'20\'1Cprimarily concerned with the management of the jails in their county," the suit states. It urged the Supreme Judicial Court to issue an injunction barring McDonald and other sheriffs from signing such agreements with ICE.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe shouldn't be diverting limited state money to federal immigration enforcement, especially when we need all available resources to get through the pandemic," Cofield said in a statement. \u8220\'20\'1CIt's time we stand together as a Commonwealth to protect our communities and to stop illegal expenditures grounded in racism, bigotry, and xenophobia."\par \par \uc2 ICE has similar agreements with sheriffs in Bristol and Barnstable counties, but the suit focuses on Plymouth County because its agreement is the only one that is \u8220\'20\'1Coperational," according to the \uc2 Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Todd Lyons, the director of ICE's Boston field office, declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit, but said the agreements with sheriffs' offices provide critical public safety support.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese law enforcement professionals understand the critical role in public safety and increased community security these agreements provide to their residents and other citizens of the state," Lyons said in a statement, adding that the state \u8220\'20\'1Cis safer as a result of the close coordination with federal law enforcement."\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for McDonald declined to comment, saying the sheriff's office had yet to see the suit.\par \par \uc2 Under the agreement, the sheriff's office designates officers to be trained and certified in federal immigration enforcement and authorizes them to interrogate detainees who they suspect are in the United States unlawfully, the suit states. They may serve warrants for arrest or removal, gather evidence, and transport immigrants across state lines to federal detention centers.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for Civil Rights attorney Orin Nimni, said the agreements are a drain on state resources.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople who want Massachusetts to be a welcoming state for immigrants and want immigrants to feel safe should also be worried about these agreements," Nimni said.\par \par \uc2 Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of the Lawyers for Civil Rights, said the agreements are \u8220\'20\'1Charmful and wasteful."\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey are bad for immigrants and bad for all of us," he said.\par \par \uc2 Last week, Massachusetts Attorney General \uc2 Maura Healey\uc2  released a 60-page report concluding that Bristol Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson's office used excessive force and illegally unleashed dogs on federal immigration detainees during a May 1 melee at the C. Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center. Tensions over coronavirus testing within the facility resulted in a clash between detainees and officers, including Hodgson, the report found.\par \par \uc2 Healey said Hodgson's office should be barred from housing federal detainees and participating in federal immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 In response, Hodgson said the report was \u8220\'20\'1Clittered with baseless allegations and assumptions" and accused Healey of using the incident to support her \u8220\'20\'1Clong-documented anti-ICE, pro-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  political agenda."\par \par \uc2 US District Judge William Young has barred Hodgson's office from admitting any new immigration detainees and ordered coronavirus testing for staff and people being held at the facility on behalf of the federal government. Young issued that order in response to a class-action lawsuit filed in March that sought the release of civil immigration detainees who were at risk of developing COVID-19.\par \par \uc2 Shelley Murphy can be reached at shelley.murphy@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Lawyers for a group of taxpayers are asking the state's highest court to nullify agreements with \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  that allow local sheriffs' offices to identify, arrest, and transport undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A lawsuit filed Monday against Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald Jr. alleges that his office's agreement with ICE is unlawful because it devotes state resources to federal civil immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is nothing in the state constitution, statute, or common law that grants Massachusetts sheriffs the power to enter into such agreements,\u8221\'20\'1D according to the lawsuit, filed by the Lawyers for Civil Rights on behalf of 28 taxpayers, including Juan Cofield, president of the New England chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\par \par \uc2 A sheriff's power is narrow, \u8220\'20\'1Cprimarily concerned with the management of the jails in their county,\u8221\'20\'1D the suit states. It urged the Supreme Judicial Court to issue an injunction barring McDonald and other sheriffs from signing suchagreements with ICE.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe shouldn't be diverting limited state money to federal immigration enforcement, especially when we need all available resources to get through the pandemic,\u8221\'20\'1D Cofield said in a statement. \u8220\'20\'1CIt's time we stand together as a Commonwealth to protect our communities and to stop illegal expenditures grounded in racism, bigotry, and xenophobia.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 ICE has similar agreements with sheriffs in Bristol and Barnstable counties, but the suit focuses on Plymouth County because its agreement is the only one that is \u8220\'20\'1Coperational,\u8221\'20\'1D according to the \uc2 Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Todd Lyons, the director of ICE's Boston field office, declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit, but said the agreements with sheriffs' offices provide critical public safety support.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese law enforcement professionals understand the critical role in public safety and increased community security these agreements provide to their residents and other citizens of the state,\u8221\'20\'1D Lyons said in a statement, adding that the state \u8220\'20\'1Cis safer as a result of the close coordination with federal law enforcement.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for McDonalddeclined to comment, saying the sheriff's office had yet to see the suit.\par \par \uc2 Under the agreement, the sheriff's office designates officers to be trained and certified in federal immigration enforcement and authorizes them to interrogate detainees who they suspect are in the United States unlawfully, the suit states. They may serve warrants for arrest or removal, gather evidence, and transport immigrants across state lines to federal detention centers.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for Civil Rights attorney Oren Nimni, said the agreements are a drain on state resources.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople who want Massachusetts to be a welcoming state for immigrants and want immigrants to feel safe should also be worried about these agreements,\u8221\'20\'1D Nimni said.\par \par \uc2 Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of the Lawyers for Civil Rights, said the agreements are \u8220\'20\'1Charmful and wasteful.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey are bad for immigrants and bad for all of us,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Last week, Massachusetts Attorney General \uc2 Maura Healey\uc2  released a 60-page report concluding that Bristol Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson's office used excessive force and illegally unleashed dogs on federal immigration detainees during a May 1 melee at the C. Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center. Tensions over coronavirus testing within the facility resulted in aclash between detainees and officers, including Hodgson, the report found.\par \par \uc2 Healey said Hodgson's office should be barred from housing federal detainees and participating in federal immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 In response,Hodgson said the report was \u8220\'20\'1Clittered with baseless allegations and assumptions\u8221\'20\'1D andaccused Healey of using the incident to support her \u8220\'20\'1Clong-documented anti-ICE, pro-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  political agenda.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 US District Judge William Young has barred Hodgson's office from admitting any new immigration detainees and ordered coronavirus testing for staff and people being held at the facility on behalf of the federal government. Young issued that order in response to a class-action lawsuit filed in March that sought the release of civil immigration detainees who were at risk of developing COVID-19.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020201222egcl0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Inquiry cites excessive force, 'callous disregard' during jail melee\par \par \uc2 Bristol Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson's office illegally unleashed dogs on detainees, used excessive force, and violated the civil rights of 25 federal immigration detainees involved in a jailhouse melee in May, according to an investigation released Tuesday by Massachusetts Attorney General \uc2 Maura Healey\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Healey said Hodgson's office showed \u8220\'20\'1Ccallous disregard" for the detainees' well-being. Her report does not recommend any criminal charges, but proposes the sheriff be barred altogether from housing federal detainees and participating in federal immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur investigation revealed that the Bristol County Sheriff's Office violated the rights of detainees by using excessive force and by seriously risking their health and safety," Healey said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Healey's investigation centered on a May 1 confrontation between sheriff's office personnel and detainees being held on civil immigration violations on behalf of \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 . The sheriff's office runs the C. Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center and is paid by ICE to house immigration detainees.\par \par \uc2 Hodgson has used its facilities to detain immigrants since 2000, when he entered into an agreement with ICE's predecessor, the US Immigration and Naturalization Service.\par \par \uc2 Hodgson, a Republican who has served as sheriff since 1997, is a fervent supporter of federal immigration enforcement and offered inmate labor in 2017 to build a wall on the US border with Mexico, the signature pledge of President Trump's first presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 Hodgson released a statement Tuesday saying the report was \u8220\'20\'1Clittered with baseless allegations and assumptions" and accused Healey of using the incident to support her \u8220\'20\'1Clong-documented anti-ICE, pro-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  political agenda."\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CShame on Massachusetts Attorney General \uc2 Maura Healey\uc2  for demonizing the corrections and law enforcement professionals at the Bristol County Sheriff's Office with her latest politically motivated stunt," said Hodgson.\par \par \uc2 His staff acted with absolute professionalism during the incident and the office stands by its response, Hodgson added.\par \par \uc2 Based on her investigation, Healey is urging action to strip Hodgson's office of its immigration role. Her report noted that the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  could sever ties with the agency or state lawmakers could enact legislation to prohibit the sheriff's office from doing immigration work.\par \par \uc2 ICE and DHS didn't respond Tuesday to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Healey's investigation found 25 immigration detainees were inside the detention center when the confrontation began over COVID-19 testing. Ten detainees who were singled out to be tested at the jail had said they were concerned about potential contamination because a few staffers had tested positive and asked instead to be tested in the immigration facility. Hodgson said no \u8212\'20\'14 concerned that they could infect their fellow residents, he said later.\par \par \uc2 Hodgson struggled with one of the detainees, which set off a larger confrontation. Hodgson and his personnel then left the area after a one correction officer released pepper spray, the report said.\par \par \uc2 Once the officers cleared the room, some detainees spent about 20 minutes breaking appliances, bathroom mirrors, sinks, and tiles, smashing walls, and barricading the door, the report said.\par \par \uc2 The detainees were then \u8220\'20\'1Ccalm and nonviolent for an hour," Healey's office said, before the sheriff's office staff confronted them and \u8220\'20\'1Cexecuted a calculated use of force" that included a flash-bang grenade, pepper spray and pepper projectiles, anti-riot shields, and dogs. The use of dogs was \u8220\'20\'1Cunlawful," the investigation found.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople were terrified. People were afraid for their lives and thought they were going to be killed at the hands of the sheriff and his deputies," said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, which represents the detainees. Sellstrom urged Hodgson to resign.\par \par \uc2 Hodgson has alleged the detainees started the fight, causing $25,000 in damage and leaving him bruised.\par \par \uc2 The detainees have said that it was Hodgson himself and his officers who attacked first and that it was jail staff who broke glass and damaged the facilities in order to stage a riot.\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Matos, executive director of the nonprofit Prisoners' Legal Services of Massachusetts, said the report shines a light on \u8220\'20\'1Cpunitive and inhumane" aspects of the US immigration detention system.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are well aware that this sort of behavior happens with a regularity that is unacceptable," she said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 So much pepper spray was used that two of the detainees were hospitalized with symptoms of respiratory distress and a third required emergency chest compressions in order to be revived, Healey's office said. The detainee who needed chest compressions was not taken to a hospital for an evaluation and was later placed in segregation.\par \par \uc2 Healey's investigation found the sheriff's office violated its own rules by using force without taking steps to deescalate the confrontation or issuing warnings to the detainees, some of whom may have not understood verbal directives because of language barriers. The report recommends the sheriff's office adopt a slate of reforms and warns she may sue if changes aren't implemented quickly.\par \par \uc2 The Office of Inspector General at the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , which oversees ICE, launched an investigation at the urging of the Massachusetts congressional delegation plus some members of the \uc2 Congressional Hispanic Caucus\uc2 . The inspector general's office declined to comment Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 At the State House, the Senate Post Audit and Oversight Committee announced an investigation into the melee and the refusal by the sheriff's office to let state Senator \uc2 Sonia Chang-D\u237\'00\'EDaz\uc2  enter the detention center after the confrontation. Senator John Keenan, who leads the committee, said it expects to release its findings by the end of the week.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 's Massachusetts affiliate filed a lawsuit in Suffolk Superior Court, alleging the sheriff's office refused to release records about the confrontation even though Hodgson had discussed it publicly.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSheriffs are elected by the people to preserve public safety and uphold the law \u8212\'20\'14 not to violate people's rights and conceal misconduct," said Carol Rose, executive director of the local branch of the ACLU.\par \par \uc2 US District Judge William Young has barred the sheriff's office from admitting any new immigration detainees and ordered coronavirus testing for staff and people being held at the facility on behalf of the federal government. Young issued the order in a class action lawsuit filed in March that sought the release of civil immigration detainees who were at risk of developing COVID-19.\par \par \uc2 Since the lawsuit was initiated, the number of immigration detainees in Bristol County has dropped from 148 people to 19 people as of Dec. 1, according to court papers. There have been no COVID-19 cases among immigration detainees there for about nine months, Hodgson's office said in court filings.\par \par \uc2 Laura Crimaldi can be reached at laura.crimaldi@globe.com.

Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center and is paid by ICE to house immigration detainees.\par \par \uc2 Hodgson has used its facilities to detain immigrants since 2000, when he entered into an agreement with ICE's predecessor, the US Immigration and Naturalization Service.\par \par \uc2 Hodgson, a Republican who has served as sheriff since1997, is a fervent supporter of federal immigration enforcement and offered inmate labor in 2017 to build a wall on the US border with Mexico, the signature pledge of President Trump's first presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 Hodgson released a statement Tuesday saying the report was \u8220\'20\'1Clittered with baseless allegations and assumptions\u8221\'20\'1D andaccused Healey of using the incident to support her \u8220\'20\'1Clong-documented anti-ICE, pro-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  political agenda.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CShame on Massachusetts Attorney General \uc2 Maura Healey\uc2  for demonizing the corrections and law enforcement professionals at the Bristol County Sheriff's Office with her latest politically motivated stunt,\u8221\'20\'1D said Hodgson.\par \par \uc2 His staff acted with absolute professionalism during the incident and the office stands by its response, Hodgson added.\par \par \uc2 Based on her investigation, Healey is urging action to strip Hodgson's office of its immigration role. Her report noted that the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  could sever ties with the agency or state lawmakers could enact legislation to prohibit the sheriff's office from doing immigration work.\par \par \uc2 ICE and DHS didn't respond Tuesday to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Healey's investigation found 25 immigration detainees were inside the detention center when the confrontation began over COVID-19 testing. Ten detainees who were singled out to be tested at the jail had said they were concerned about potential contamination because a few staffers had tested positive and asked instead to be tested in the immigration facility. Hodgson said no \u8212\'20\'14 concerned that they could infect their fellow residents, he said later.\par \par \uc2 Hodgson struggled with one of the detainees, which set off a larger confrontation. Hodgson and his personnel then left the area after a one correction officer released pepper spray, the report said.\par \par \uc2 Once the officers cleared the room, some detainees spent about 20 minutes breaking appliances, bathroom mirrors, sinks, and tiles, smashing walls, and barricading the door, the report said.\par \par \uc2 The detainees were then \u8220\'20\'1Ccalm and nonviolent for an hour,\u8221\'20\'1D Healey's office said, before the sheriff's office staff confronted them and \u8220\'20\'1Cexecuted a calculated use of force\u8221\'20\'1D that included a flash-bang grenade, pepper spray and pepper projectiles, anti-riot shields, and dogs. The use of dogs was \u8220\'20\'1Cunlawful,\u8221\'20\'1D the investigation found.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople were terrified. People were afraid for their lives and thought they were going to be killed at the hands of the sheriff and his deputies,\u8221\'20\'1D said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, which represents the detainees. Sellstrom urged Hodgson to resign.\par \par \uc2 Hodgson has alleged the detainees started the fight, causing $25,000 in damage and leavinghim bruised.\par \par \uc2 The detainees have said that it was Hodgson himself and his officers who attacked first and that it was jail staff who broke glass and damaged the facilities in order to stage a riot.\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Matos, executive director of the nonprofit Prisoners' Legal Services of Massachusetts, said the report shines a light on \u8220\'20\'1Cpunitive and inhumane\u8221\'20\'1D aspects of the US immigration detention system.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are well aware that this sort of behavior happens with a regularity that is unacceptable,\u8221\'20\'1D she said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 So much pepper spray was used that two of the detainees were hospitalized with symptoms of respiratory distress and a third required emergency chest compressions in order to be revived, Healey's office said. The detainee who needed chest compressions was not taken to a hospital for an evaluation and was later placed in segregation.\par \par \uc2 Healey's investigation found the sheriff's office violated its own rules by using force without taking steps to deescalate the confrontation or issuing warnings to the detainees, some of whom may have not understood verbal directives because of language barriers. The report recommends the sheriff's office adopt a slate of reforms and warns she may sue if changes aren't implemented quickly.\par \par \uc2 The Office of Inspector General at the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , which oversees ICE, launched an investigation at the urging of the Massachusetts congressional delegation plus some members of the \uc2 Congressional Hispanic Caucus\uc2 . The inspector general's office declined to comment Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 At the State House, the Senate Post Audit and Oversight Committee announced an investigation into the melee and the refusal by the sheriff's office to let state Senator \uc2 Sonia Chang-D\u237\'00\'EDaz\uc2  enter the detention center after the confrontation. Senator John Keenan, who leads the committee, said it expects to release its findings by the end of the week.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 's Massachusetts affiliate filed a lawsuit in Suffolk Superior Court, alleging the sheriff's office refused to release records about the confrontation even though Hodgson had discussed it publicly.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSheriffs are elected by the people to preserve public safety and uphold the law \u8212\'20\'14 not to violate people's rights and conceal misconduct,\u8221\'20\'1D said Carol Rose, executive director of the local branch of the ACLU.\par \par \uc2 US District Judge William Young has barred the sheriff's office from admitting any new immigration detainees and ordered coronavirus testing for staff and people being held at the facility on behalf of the federal government. Young issued the order in a class action lawsuit filed in March that sought the release of civil immigration detainees who were at risk of developing COVID-19.\par \par \uc2 Since the lawsuit was initiated, the number of immigration detainees in Bristol County has dropped from 148 people to 19 people as of Dec. 1, according to court papers. There have been no COVID-19 cases among immigration detainees there for about nine months, Hodgson's office said in court filings.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020201215egcf001gu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Imposing a stricter measure to control the spread of the coronavirus, Governor \uc2 Andrew Cuomo\uc2  said Wednesday that he would start requiring people in New York to wear masks or face coverings in public whenever social distancing was not possible.\par \par \uc2 The order will take effect Saturday and will apply to people who cannot keep 6 feet apart from others in public settings, such as on a bus or subway, a crowded sidewalk, or inside a grocery store.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CStopping the spread is everything," Cuomo said during his daily briefing in Albany. \u8220\'20\'1CHow can you not wear a mask when you're going to come close to a person?"\par \par \uc2 The new requirements are bound to make face coverings an inescapable and perhaps jarring sight in New York City for the foreseeable future. They could also introduce a level of mutual obligation and civic duty about wearing masks in public that is more firmly established in Asia than in the West.\par \par \uc2 Cuomo said local governments would enforce the order, but he noted that the failure to wear a face covering would not lead to people being ordered out of public transit. He said the state would consider issuing civil penalties to people who failed to abide by the order, but not criminal penalties.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou're not going to go to jail for not wearing a mask," he said.\par \par \uc2 New York and New Jersey are the only states to have issued broad orders mandating face coverings in most public settings, according to the \uc2 National Governors Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Nonbinding guidelines from the \uc2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\uc2  encourage people to wear face coverings in settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Cuomo said the new measures were necessary as the state continued to rein in the spread of the virus: On Tuesday, a key indicator involving the number of virus patients in hospitals improved for the first time.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll people in public must have a mask or nose covering, mouth and nose covering, and they must wear it in a situation where you cannot or are not maintaining social distancing," Cuomo said.\par \par \uc2 The governor said a mask was not necessary if, for example, a person was walking down an empty street. But, he said, \u8220\'20\'1CYou're now at an intersection and there are people at the intersection and you're going to be in proximity to other people? Put the mask on."\par \par \uc2 New York Times\par \par \uc2 California will give each \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  $500\par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u8212\'20\'14 California will give cash payments to immigrants living in the country illegally, Governor \uc2 Gavin Newsom\uc2  announced Wednesday, using a mix of taxpayer money and charitable contributions to give 150,000 adults $500 each during the coronavirus outbreak.\par \par \uc2 California has an estimated 2 million immigrants living in the country illegally. They are not eligible for the $2.2 trillion stimulus package approved by Congress last month, which gives cash payments to most Americans plus boosts unemployment benefits by $600 per week.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe feel a deep sense of gratitude for people that are in fear of deportations that are still addressing essential needs of tens of millions of Californians," said Newsom, who noted 10 percent of the state's workforce are immigrants living in the country illegally who paid more than $2.5 billion in state and local taxes last year.\par \par \uc2 Taxpayers are kicking in $75 million for the money, while a group of charities has committed to raise another $50 million for a total of $125 million. A group of charities has already donated $5.5 million for the fund, including the \uc2 Emerson Collective\uc2 , Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Endowment, the James Irvine Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and an anonymous donor.\par \par \uc2 Newsom said the money will not be distributed based on income. "Their personal information will not be required" to get the support, he said.\par \par \uc2 California has been the most aggressive state in the nation when it comes to giving benefits to immigrants living in the country illegally. Last year, it became the first state to give taxpayer-funded health benefits to low-income adults 25 and younger living in the country illegally. This year, Newsom had proposed expanding those benefits to seniors 65 and older.\par \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \par \uc2 Woman in medically induced coma gives birth to girl\par \par \uc2 When Angela Primachenko awoke April 6 from a week-long, medically induced coma, she was disoriented because of all of the medications in her body.\par \par \uc2 She had also lost her pregnant belly and gained a newborn daughter, while doctors kept her unconscious so that her body could fight a severe case of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.\par \par \uc2 "I just woke up and all of a sudden I didn't have my belly anymore," she told NBC's "Today" show from her home in Vancouver, Wash. "It was just extremely mind-blowing."\par \par \uc2 On March 22, Primachenko had a runny nose and suspected she was suffering from spring allergies. Two days later, the 27-year-old had developed a fever \u8212\'20\'14 a dangerous condition for a woman 33 weeks pregnant. She went to the hospital where she worked as a respiratory therapist to be tested for the coronavirus.\par \par \uc2 "I was taking precautions. I didn't go to work because I am pregnant," Primachenko told "Today." "I don't know where I caught it, I don't know where it happened, but somehow I just ended up coming to the hospital and just getting sicker fand sicker."\par \par \uc2 She tested positive for the virus on March 26, and her health rapidly deteriorated. Two days later, she was struggling to breathe normally. On March 29, her doctors put her into the medically induced coma so that her body could focus on overcoming the infection.\par \par \uc2 On April 1, while Primachenko was still unconscious and fighting the virus, doctors induced labor and delivered her daughter Ava.\par \par \uc2 Washington Post\par \par \uc2 A new accolade for Fauci: plush doll in his likeness\par \par \uc2 SIMSBURY, Conn. \u8212\'20\'14 The nation's top infectious disease specialist is getting a plush doll made in his likeness.\par \par \uc2 Simsbury-based New England Toy, which makes custom plush bears and other toys, has created a 12-inch version of \uc2 Dr. Anthony Fauci\uc2 , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has often appeared with President Trump at media briefings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The doll sells for $25; the firm says $5 from each sale will go to a COVID-19 charity.\par \par \uc2 Company founder Josh Livingston told The Hartford Courant he sees Dr. Fauci as a hero.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI'm very inspired by him," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CI just love his no-nonsense approach and how he speaks the truth, whether it's something you want to hear or you don't."\par \par \uc2 Fauci's face also appears on a bobblehead and on socks. And a Rochester, N.Y., shop is selling doughnuts with his face, surrounded by white frosting and topped off with red, white, and blue sprinkles.\par \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020200812eg4g001jr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Imposing a stricter measure to control the spread of the coronavirus, Governor \uc2 Andrew Cuomo\uc2  said Wednesday that he would start requiring people in New York to wear masks or face coverings in public whenever social distancing was not possible.\par \par \uc2 The order will take effect Saturday and will apply to people who cannot keep 6 feet apart from others in public settings, such as on a bus or subway, a crowded sidewalk, or inside a grocery store.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CStopping the spread is everything," Cuomo said during his daily briefing in Albany. \u8220\'20\'1CHow can you not wear a mask when you're going to come close to a person?"\par \par \uc2 The new requirements are bound to make face coverings an inescapable and perhaps jarring sight in New York City for the foreseeable future. They could also introduce a level of mutual obligation and civic duty about wearing masks in public that is more firmly established in Asia than in the West.\par \par \uc2 Cuomo said local governments would enforce the order, but he noted that the failure to wear a face covering would not lead to people being ordered out of public transit. He said the state would consider issuing civil penalties to people who failed to abide by the order, but not criminal penalties.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou're not going to go to jail for not wearing a mask," he said.\par \par \uc2 New York and New Jersey are the only states to have issued broad orders mandating face coverings in most public settings, according to the \uc2 National Governors Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Nonbinding guidelines from the \uc2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\uc2  encourage people to wear face coverings in settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Cuomo said the new measures were necessary as the state continued to rein in the spread of the virus: On Tuesday, a key indicator involving the number of virus patients in hospitals improved for the first time.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll people in public must have a mask or nose covering, mouth and nose covering, and they must wear it in a situation where you cannot or are not maintaining social distancing," Cuomo said.\par \par \uc2 The governor said a mask was not necessary if, for example, a person was walking down an empty street. But, he said, \u8220\'20\'1CYou're now at an intersection and there are people at the intersection and you're going to be in proximity to other people? Put the mask on."\par \par \uc2 New York Times\par \par \uc2 California will give each \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  $500\par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u8212\'20\'14 California will give cash payments to immigrants living in the country illegally, Governor \uc2 Gavin Newsom\uc2  announced Wednesday, using a mix of taxpayer money and charitable contributions to give 150,000 adults $500 each during the coronavirus outbreak.\par \par \uc2 California has an estimated 2 million immigrants living in the country illegally. They are not eligible for the $2.2 trillion stimulus package approved by Congress last month, which gives cash payments to most Americans plus boosts unemployment benefits by $600 per week.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe feel a deep sense of gratitude for people that are in fear of deportations that are still addressing essential needs of tens of millions of Californians," said Newsom, who noted 10 percent of the state's workforce are immigrants living in the country illegally who paid more than $2.5 billion in state and local taxes last year.\par \par \uc2 Taxpayers are kicking in $75 million for the money, while a group of charities has committed to raise another $50 million for a total of $125 million. A group of charities has already donated $5.5 million for the fund, including the \uc2 Emerson Collective\uc2 , Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Endowment, the James Irvine Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and an anonymous donor.\par \par \uc2 Newsom said the money will not be distributed based on income. "Their personal information will not be required" to get the support, he said.\par \par \uc2 California has been the most aggressive state in the nation when it comes to giving benefits to immigrants living in the country illegally. Last year, it became the first state to give taxpayer-funded health benefits to low-income adults 25 and younger living in the country illegally. This year, Newsom had proposed expanding those benefits to seniors 65 and older.\par \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \par \uc2 Woman in medically induced coma gives birth to girl\par \par \uc2 When Angela Primachenko awoke April 6 from a week-long, medically induced coma, she was disoriented because of all of the medications in her body.\par \par \uc2 She had also lost her pregnant belly and gained a newborn daughter, while doctors kept her unconscious so that her body could fight a severe case of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.\par \par \uc2 "I just woke up and all of a sudden I didn't have my belly anymore," she told NBC's "Today" show from her home in Vancouver, Wash. "It was just extremely mind-blowing."\par \par \uc2 On March 22, Primachenko had a runny nose and suspected she was suffering from spring allergies. Two days later, the 27-year-old had developed a fever \u8212\'20\'14 a dangerous condition for a woman 33 weeks pregnant. She went to the hospital where she worked as a respiratory therapist to be tested for the coronavirus.\par \par \uc2 "I was taking precautions. I didn't go to work because I am pregnant," Primachenko told "Today." "I don't know where I caught it, I don't know where it happened, but somehow I just ended up coming to the hospital and just getting sicker fand sicker."\par \par \uc2 She tested positive for the virus on March 26, and her health rapidly deteriorated. Two days later, she was struggling to breathe normally. On March 29, her doctors put her into the medically induced coma so that her body could focus on overcoming the infection.\par \par \uc2 On April 1, while Primachenko was still unconscious and fighting the virus, doctors induced labor and delivered her daughter Ava.\par \par \uc2 Washington Post\par \par \uc2 A new accolade for Fauci: plush doll in his likeness\par \par \uc2 SIMSBURY, Conn. \u8212\'20\'14 The nation's top infectious disease specialist is getting a plush doll made in his likeness.\par \par \uc2 Simsbury-based New England Toy, which makes custom plush bears and other toys, has created a 12-inch version of \uc2 Dr. Anthony Fauci\uc2 , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has often appeared with President Trump at media briefings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The doll sells for $25; the firm says $5 from each sale will go to a COVID-19 charity.\par \par \uc2 Company founder Josh Livingston told The Hartford Courant he sees Dr. Fauci as a hero.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI'm very inspired by him," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CI just love his no-nonsense approach and how he speaks the truth, whether it's something you want to hear or you don't."\par \par \uc2 Fauci's face also appears on a bobblehead and on socks. And a Rochester, N.Y., shop is selling doughnuts with his face, surrounded by white frosting and topped off with red, white, and blue sprinkles.\par \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020200717eg4f000w0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 News\par {\*\bkmkstart toc6}{\*\bkmkend toc6}\b \uc2 Here's how \uc2 Sarah Sanders\uc2  responded to questions on \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  and Paul Manafort\b0\par\par\uc2 Jaclyn Reiss \par \uc2 4,783 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 August 2018\par \uc2 The Boston Globe\par \uc2 BSTNGB\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2018 The Boston Globe. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 White House press secretary \uc2 Sarah Huckabee Sanders\uc2  took to the podium on Wednesday, fielding questions about Tuesday's conviction of President Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and the nearly simultaneous guilty plea of his former lawyer, \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As reporters peppered Sanders with question after question about Cohen \u8212\'20\'14 who said Tuesday that Trump directed him to make hush money payments to two women with the purpose of "influencing the election" \u8212\'20\'14 she repeated the same mantra over and over: That the president \u8220\'20\'1Cdid nothing wrong" and there are \u8220\'20\'1Cno charges against him."\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CJust because \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  made a plea deal, that doesn't implicate the president on anything," she said.\par \par \uc2 Cohen's lawyer also said earlier Wednesday that his client has "knowledge" about computer hacking and collusion that may interest special counsel Robert Mueller.\par \par \uc2 Asked about that, Sanders replied: "I don't think the president is concerned at all."\par \par \uc2 Sanders also reiterated the president's claims that there was \u8220\'20\'1Cno collusion," and repeatedly referred questions to Trump's outside counsel.\par \par \uc2 When one frustrated reporter asked why the outside counsel couldn't come into the briefing room to answer questions, Sanders told him, \u8220\'20\'1CThey don't work here at the White House."\par \par \uc2 Sanders was also repeatedly asked about Manafort, who Trump said he feels badly for.\par \par \uc2 When asked if the president was considering a presidential pardon for Manafort, Sanders initially replied that it \u8220\'20\'1Cdoesn't have anything to do with the president." When more reporters pressed the issue, the spokeswoman said there had been \u8220\'20\'1Cno discussions" about a potential pardon.\par \par \uc2 A reporter also asked about the calls for impeachment. Sanders said the White House was taking the allegations \u8220\'20\'1Cseriously," but added: \u8220\'20\'1CThe idea of an impeachment is frankly a sad attempt by the Democrats. It's the only message they have going into the midterms." She then encouraged voters to support \u8220\'20\'1Clike-minded candidates like the president."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Read a full transcript of the White House press briefing, as provided by the White House:\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. As you've all seen, Hurricane Lane is a Category 4 storm that is expected to have a significant impact on the State of Hawaii. Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2  briefed the President on this hurricane this morning.\par \par \uc2 We encourage all those in the path of the storm to listen to the instruction of state and local authorities as it relates to evacuation orders and shelter locations.\par \par \uc2 The President is deeply concerned for the wellbeing of all Hawaiians, and has directed FEMA and administration officials to remain in close coordination with the State of Hawaii and stand ready to support them in whatever they need.\par \par \uc2 Also this morning, the President had a phone call with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. The two leaders committed to maintaining strong sanctions on North Korea. The two also expressed that they look forward to seeing each other later this year at UNGA, and to continue these important conversations with allies.\par \par \uc2 Lastly, on behalf of our entire administration, I want to extend prayers to the family, friends, and loved ones of Mollie Tibbetts. The nation has watched for over 30 days as local, state, and federal officials have searched for Mollie, a rising sophomore at the \uc2 University of Iowa\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Sadly, the individual believed to be responsible for the murder is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , making this an unfortunate reminder of why we need to strengthen our immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 The Bible tells us in Psalms that \u8220\'20\'1C[The Lord] heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds." The Tibbetts family is hurting, and they're on the hearts of all Americans, and we are grieving with them.\par \par \uc2 With that, I'll take your questions. Cecilia.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you, Sarah. \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2 , under oath, pleaded guilty to -- among things -- paying Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal during the campaign. And he says he did it at the direction of the President of the United States. Did President Trump commit a crime?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: As the President said, and we've stated many times, he did nothing wrong. There are no charges against him. And we've commented on this extensively.\par \par \uc2 Q Then why not report these payments?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get into the back-and-forth details. I can tell you, as the President has stated on numerous occasions, he did nothing wrong. There are no charges against him in this. And just because \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  made a plea deal doesn't mean that that implicates the President on anything.\par \par \uc2 Q Can you stand here today and say the President has never lied to the American people? Because so many people now look back at that tape of him on Air Force One, saying he knew nothing about these payments, when, in fact, we now know he knew everything about these payments. So has he lied?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Look, again, I think that's a ridiculous accusation. The President, in this matter, has done nothing wrong. And there are no charges against him.\par \par \uc2 John.\par \par \uc2 Q The President has said to Fox News, in an interview with Ainsley Earhardt this morning, that this could not have been an illegal campaign contribution because he paid the money. He put more than $60 million of his own money into the campaign. So how do you draw the line between -- I mean, maybe this didn't flow through the campaign, but how do you draw the line between what was a campaign contribution and what might have been a payment to somebody for other purposes?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Look, I'm not going to get into the back-and-forths of the legal part of this. I would refer you to the President's outside counsel on that. As I told Cecilia, what I can tell you is what the President has stated a number of times: He did nothing wrong. There are no charges against him. Just because \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  has made a deal doesn't mean anything with regards to the President.\par \par \uc2 Steven.\par \par \uc2 Q Sarah, the President tweeted this morning a frustration that \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  wrote. Perhaps you can shed a little bit more light on that. Because the implication is that \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  gave up something that the President would rather stay secret. Is that what we should read into this, or is there another explanation?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: The President has expressed his views on that. I don't have anything further to add.\par \par \uc2 Q Can I ask you one other question? Is the President now planning on, or intent on, pardoning Paul Manafort?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: The Manafort case doesn't have anything to do with the President, doesn't have anything to do with his campaign, and it doesn't have anything to do with the White House.\par \par \uc2 Margaret.\par \par \uc2 Q Sarah, I actually was going to ask about Manafort, but let me ask in a slightly different way. Even if it has nothing to do with the President, he still could have the power to pardon Mr. Manafort. Is that something that he's begun discussing with the team? Have you ruled it out? Has it come up? And the --\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of any conversations regarding that at all.\par \par \uc2 Q Thanks. The question that I also have --\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Other than, actually, when he was asked by a news outlet earlier this week, and he said that he hadn't been thinking about that at all.\par \par \uc2 Q Thanks. In times like this -- not that there are that many times like this -- the White House has often tried to figure out whether there needs to be any internal adjustments to deal with some of the political issues you're going to have now with the Hill, with voters, with -- internally, with lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 Is the White House making any adjustments in terms of responsibilities of Chiefs of Staff, of communications to donors, communications to supporters, how you intend to kind of respond both protectively and offensively to the crisis that you're now in?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I wouldn't view it that way, at all, and would disagree with the premise of your question. The White House is focused on the same things that we were focused on the first day that we got here. And that is growing the economy, which is doing extremely well; protecting our borders; strengthening the safety and security of all Americans. Those are the things that were focused on day one, January 20th. And those are the same things that we're focused on right now.\par \par \uc2 Jake.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you, Sarah. First, I'd like to start off by congratulating you. This is your 100th briefing, and there's no way what you do every day is easy.\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Thanks.\par \par \uc2 Q I got two real questions. First of all, our colleague, Jonathan Swan, over at Axios, recently wrote -- and I quote, \u8220\'20\'1CSeveral top Republican operatives working on the midterm elections told me Trump's fanciful 'red wave' predictions could depress Republican turnout and ironically serve to make any blue wave even bigger." So are you familiar with any Republican operatives who would concur with this statement?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of. I think that the thing that's going to encourage people is the lack of a message by Democrats. They have nothing to run on other than attacking this President. And not only is the President and the record that Republicans have had over the last year and a half, under his leadership, is a great one to run on. We have an incredible story to tell. The economy is booming. Record numbers just today. We're going to continue focusing on the things that Americans care about, and I think that will be certainly what encourages them, and certainly what will help push Republicans to do well in November.\par \par \uc2 Q And yesterday -- yesterday, the President stated that, quote, \u8220\'20\'1CIsrael will pay a price for the Jerusalem Embassy." I'm not sure if that's an exact quote, though. Should Israel be concerned that the price they may have to pay would be one that they're not prepared or willing to pay at this point?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: We think that the President's decision was the right one to move the embassy -- something that other Presidents had promised and failed to do. This is a President who's been delivering on the promises that he's made.\par \par \uc2 Q Sure. But about the price --\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Sorry.\par \par \uc2 Q What price are we talking about? What price might Israel have to pay?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I don't have anything further for you.\par \par \uc2 Jon.\par \par \uc2 Q Thanks a lot, Sarah. Since those guilty verdicts yesterday in the Paul Manafort trial, the President has said some kind things about Mr. Manafort. He's called him a \u8220\'20\'1Cgood man," a \u8220\'20\'1Cgood person." He said he feels badly for what has happened to him. He tweeted today, \u8220\'20\'1C\u8230\'20\'26unlike \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2 , he refused to 'break' -- make up stories in order to get a 'deal."' He tweeted, \u8220\'20\'1CSuch respect for a brave man!" Is Mr. Manafort a simple candidate for a presidential pardon?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Once again, that's not something that has been up for discussion. I don't have anything for you on that.\par \par \uc2 Q Can I ask you about the Kavanaugh nomination? There's some Democrats that are saying that the nomination should be put on hold because of the legal developments yesterday. Hawaiian Senator Mazie Hirono put out a statement. She said: This President, who is an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal manner, does not deserve the courtesy of a meeting his nominee. What is your reaction to that, Sarah?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: This is a desperate and pathetic attempt by Democrats to obstruct a very highly qualified nominee. The hearing date has been set for September 4th, and Judge Kavanaugh will be there.\par \par \uc2 Steve.\par \par \uc2 Q Yes, Sarah. Trade talks between the United States and China are resuming. The President, earlier this week, expressed quite low expectations for those talks. I'm wondering if that has changed, and what you would like to see come out of these discussions.\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: As you said, these conversations are continuing. I don't have any announcements on them. They're ongoing. Certainly, what we'd like to see is better trade deals for the United States. The President wants to see free, fair, and more reciprocal trade between other countries, particularly with China, and we're going to continue in those conversations.\par \par \uc2 Jeff.\par \par \uc2 Q Sarah, does the President feel betrayed by \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2 ? And is he concerned about what he might say to Robert Mueller?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I don't think the President is concerned at all. He knows that he did nothing wrong and that there was no collusion. And we're going to continue focusing on the things that Americans care about and that we can have an impact on.\par \par \uc2 Q And one more question on trade: Do you anticipate a deal between Mexico and the United States on \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  this week?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get ahead of any potential announcement. For decades, \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  has harmed American workers and cost the U.S. billions of dollars. We're focused on making sure we deal with and address those problems, and we'll let you know when we have an announcement.\par \par \uc2 Kaitlan.\par \par \uc2 Q Thanks, Sarah. In his interview today, the President said he found out about those payments that \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  made later on. But he's on tape discussing how to make one of the payments with \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  -- so before the payment was made. So how do you explain that?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Once again, I've commented on this pretty extensively. What I can tell you about this is that the President did nothing wrong. There are no charges against him. There is no collusion for anything beyond that. I would refer you to the President's outside counsel.\par \par \uc2 Q \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2  is not a taxpayer-funded spokesperson for the President. You are.\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm aware of that.\par \par \uc2 Q So how can you not explain something the President said today, on the grounds of the White House, that seems to contradict an audio that has been confirmed that it is of the President saying that?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Once again, I have addressed this a number of times. Just because you continue to ask the same questions over and over, I'm not going to give you a different answer. The President has done nothing wrong. There are no charges against him. There is no collusion. That's what I can tell you about this. If you want something further, I would refer you to the President's outside counsel.\par \par \uc2 Julie. Oh, sorry, I called on Francesca. I'll come back to you, Julie.\par \par \uc2 Q Does the White House maintain the President did not have affairs with Karen McDougal or Stephanie Clifford?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: We've addressed this a number of times.\par \par \uc2 Francesca, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Q Thanks, Sarah. Two questions. First, you said that there have been no discussions about a potential pardon for Paul Manafort. So you're not ruling it out entirely. I mean, if there's no discussions about it at this point, the President hasn't said he won't do it, it's possible that there could be a pardon for him in the future. Is that correct?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: The only comment that the President has made on this was when he was asked by a news outlet earlier this week, and he said, no, he was not considering that.\par \par \uc2 Q Well, that was at the time --\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Beyond that, there have been no other discussions.\par \par \uc2 Q That was before Paul Manafort was convicted on 8 of the 18 counts, at the time when the President was asked that. So I'm asking now -- now that he's been convicted on those counts, is this something that --\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: And I'm answering you now that there have been no discussions at the White House on that matter.\par \par \uc2 Q All right. Okay, on a different point: Last time that we were in here, you read off some ex-officials and one current official who the President was considering taking away their security clearance. I wanted to follow up on that and ask you, who was -- first of all, who was conducting that review to determine whether or not those security clearances would be pulled?\par \par \uc2 And second of all, I wanted to ask you about a tweet that the President said, saying that he thought that potentially James Clapper is being \u8220\'20\'1Cnice" to him so that he doesn't lose his security clearance. Is that a threat -- that if James Clapper isn't nice to him, that he'll lose his security clearance?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: No, I don't have any other announcements on that front. We're continuing to review. When we have an announcement, I'll let you know.\par \par \uc2 Julie, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Q (Inaudible) who was doing the review?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\par \par \uc2 Q Who was doing the review? That was my other question.\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: A number of people involved here at the White House.\par \par \uc2 Julie, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Q Sarah, in his tweet about Paul Manafort this morning, the President seemed to be praising him for essentially refusing to cooperate with federal prosecutors in a way that could implicate him, the President. Is that what he meant to suggest? And doesn't that seem to indicate that he thinks that loyalty to him personally is more important with abiding by the law or cooperating with this government in an investigation?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Not at all. The Manafort case doesn't involve the President, doesn't involve his campaign, and has nothing to do with the White House. The President has expressed his views.\par \par \uc2 Saagar.\par \par \uc2 Q Thanks, Sarah. \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2 's lawyer has suggested publicly that there is new evidence that they would like to present about foreknowledge of election hacking. So does the President -- does the White House maintain there was no foreknowledge of any election hacking during the 2016 campaign?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of anything, no.\par \par \uc2 Q Sarah, two questions, as well, for you. Given that five convicted felons are now linked to the President or his campaign, and given that the President promised to hire the \u8220\'20\'1Cbest people," did he fail to live up to that promise?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Look, the President has employed thousands of people in his lifetime, and had incredible successes, both in business and in the public service. He's the President of the United States, so I think he's doing quite well.\par \par \uc2 Q And can I just follow up? My second question, Sarah, just to follow on Cecilia. Because I understand that you don't want to answer the same question a million times, and you said the President did nothing illegal, but I didn't hear a response to the question: Did he lie to the American people when he talked about this on Air Force One?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: No. And the President has addressed this a number of times.\par \par \uc2 Q Sarah, thank you. I have a couple questions. President Trump says he feels badly for Cohen and Manafort. One of the men pleaded guilty to crimes. The other was found guilty of crimes, including tax fraud, which robbed the American public of tax dollars they were owed. Why does he feel bad for either of these men?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Once again, the President has expressed his views on this matter, and I have nothing else to add on that.\par \par \uc2 Q Just to follow up on that, does he believe that there is an intrinsic problem with the Justice Department? Or does he only believe if someone who was close to him is a victim of the Justice Department?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: No -- I think we've certainly seen a lot of concerns come out of some of the activities of people that worked at the Department of Justice, whether it's Peter Strzok or Lisa Page or James Comey. We've walked through those a number of times, and certainly I think it's given cause for a lot of Americans -- some of the activities those individuals engaged in.\par \par \uc2 Q No, but when the person in question is someone who's close to him, the President paints them as a victim, as if his own Justice Department is not doing its job, or has done it unfairly.\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Again, certainly the President has expressed his views on this matter, and he's raised concerns about a number of other problems that he has seen within the Department of Justice.\par \par \uc2 Hunter.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you. I wanted to follow up about the earlier question about the President's comments on Fox News, with regard to the payments to Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal. When exactly did he learn about them? And also, are there any other payments he has now become aware of? Or are those the only two women who have received money for agreeing not to repeat their stories of alleged affairs with the President?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Once again, I've addressed all that I'm going to say on the Cohen issue. For those specific questions, with more details, I would refer you to the President's outside counsel.\par \par \uc2 Q If we're going to refer such crucial matters to the outside counsel, can't we bring them in here for the briefing?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: They don't work here --\par \par \uc2 Q Or even better, have a press conference with the President.\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: They don't work here at the White House, but I would certainly encourage you to reach out to them.\par \par \uc2 John.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you, Sarah. Going back to the security clearances, all signs are this is the first time a President personally has been handling the removal of security clearances; it's usually been done by superiors. Even in the last two big espionage cases of the Cold War -- the Irvin Scarbeck case of 1961, and Felix Bloch of 1990 -- the Secretary of State pulled the security clearances of people accused of espionage.\par \par \uc2 You said the President -- that \u8220\'20\'1Cothers are reviewing it." Who are these others reviewing it? And does the President take a personal role in the potential removal of security clearances?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Certainly, the President has the constitutional authority to do so. I know this will come as a shock to you, but I'm not aware of the details of those specific cases that you outlined. But the President has the authority to make that decision.\par \par \uc2 Q Yes.\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: He's also consulting with members of his national security team and members of his legal team here at the White House to make those decisions.\par \par \uc2 Q Is he also considering a policy of just simply having all security passes turned in when someone leaves government service?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of that. As a policy, certainly we would like the ability, if needed, to be able to consult with individuals on national security matters. But they do feel -- the team here -- that we should look at the security clearance process as whole. My understanding is that there are roughly 5 million people that have security clearances here in the United States, and we'd like to take a look at the overall process of who has and who maintains those security clearances.\par \par \uc2 Q Top Secret?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Deborah.\par \par \uc2 Q Yeah. You're right about the President having constitutional authority, as far as I understand, about security clearances, as well as pardons. So I guess the question I have is: Even though he has that authority, has anybody in the White House thought about putting together boards that would look at security clearances for former personnel? And pardons as well? Because the President doesn't seem to be consulting the pardon attorney in the AG's office much. Is he consulting people? Has he thought of doing something that would be more transparent perhaps?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Certainly, as the review of the security clearances, there is a working group that is looking at the overall security clearance process and who maintains those, and whether or not those are needed across the board within government.\par \par \uc2 In terms of the pardon process, again, the President has the authority to carry out those decisions. He takes input and looks at them on a case-by-case basis.\par \par \uc2 Kristen.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you, Sarah.\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Kristen, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Q Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Q Come back to me, please?\par \par \uc2 Q Just on that -- you said that there are people who are looking at security clearances. Can you tell us who they are?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: There are a number of members on the national security team. I'd have to get back to you. I know that the Chief of Staff is involved in that process.\par \par \uc2 Q Sarah, thank you. Earlier this week, the President told our colleagues at Reuters that --\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Can you speak up? I'm sorry.\par \par \uc2 Q Sorry. The President said earlier this week to Reuters that he could \u8220\'20\'1Crun it," in reference to the Mueller investigation. What did he mean by that?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: The President has said many times that he's chosen to remain uninvolved in this process, and that's where we are right now. If you have anything further --\par \par \uc2 Q But is that an indication that he's thinking about taking some type of action against Special Counsel Robert Mueller, like revoking his security clearances?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of any conversation around that.\par \par \uc2 Q Is it an indication that the President sees himself as above the law?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Not at all.\par \par \uc2 Raquel, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Q Hi. Thank you, Sarah, very much. Some legal experts and lawmakers are saying the President is corrupt and there are ground for an impeachment case. Is the White House concerned about that, that could have an effect in the mid-elections --the midterm elections? And also, does the White House take these allegations seriously?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Certainly, we take allegations seriously. The idea of an impeachment is, frankly, a sad attempt by Democrats. It's the only message they seem to have going into the midterms. And I think it's another great reminder of why Americans should support other like-minded candidates, like the President, that are actually focused on continuing to grow the economy, continuing to secure our borders, continuing to focus on the safety and security of all Americans.\par \par \uc2 I think that the biggest contrast you could possibly make is the message of the Democrats, which is nothing more than attacking the President and looking at cheap political stunts while this White House and Republicans in the House and Senate are focused on actually doing good things for the American people.\par \par \uc2 Eamon.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you, Sarah. Earlier this week, the President had some tough words of criticism for \uc2 Jay Powell\uc2 , the Federal Reserve Chairman. Can you tell us when the last time the President and Powell met face-to-face, and whether or not the President brought up that criticism with Powell directly?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I believe the last time they met -- I'd have to double-check -- was right around the time that Jerome Powell took his place on the \uc2 Federal Reserve board\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Q So has he spoken to him directly about his concerns about raising interest rates?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm not aware that they've spoken about that at all.\par \par \uc2 One last question -- sorry, go ahead, Emerald.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you, Sarah. On Venezuela, is the President involved -- planning on getting involved there at all? There's millions fleeing the country now. What is the U.S. stance on Venezuela at this point?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: The United States continues to support Venezuela's neighbors, and provide emergency aid and shelter to Venezuela, and also continues to stand with the people of Venezuela. And we're going to keep all options on the table. And we'll keep you posted if we have any further announcements.\par \par \uc2 Thank you so much. And we're going to wrap up here so that we can all join the President for the Medal of Honor ceremony. Thanks, guys.\par \par \uc2 Credit: By Jaclyn Reiss Globe Staff\par \par \uc2 Caption:\par \par \uc2 White House press secretary \uc2 Sarah Huckabee Sanders\uc2  took to the podium on Wednesday, fielding questions about Tuesday's conviction of President Trump's former ca\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020180822ee8m001p9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Democratic candidate for governor \uc2 Jay Gonzalez\uc2 's campaign slogan is \u8220\'20\'1CLet's Aim High!"\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, he may have aimed a little too, um, high, calling into WEEI's Kirk & Callahan Show \u8212\'20\'14 hosted by Kirk Minihane and \uc2 Gerry Callahan\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 and quickly sounding as if he regretted trying to tangle with the pugnacious hosts whose politics seem a long way from the Needham liberal.\par \par \uc2 After a discussion of Governor \uc2 Charlie Baker\uc2 's reversal Monday, deciding not to send the Massachusetts National Guard to the Mexican border, the chat turned to other topics, including more historical matters.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CDo you think Trump is like Hitler?" Callahan asked Gonzalez in the 9 a.m. hour of the popular talk radio show.\par \par \uc2 Uh oh!\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CUmm," Gonzalez paused. \u8220\'20\'1CI think Trump's a terrible president, and I think he's divisive, and I think he's hateful. I don't like that we have a president that mocks people with disabilities, assaults women, and takes this anti-immigrant stance to the extent that he has\u8212\'20\'14"\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI would call it anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," Callahan chimed in.\par \par \uc2 Then Callahan got back to the question at hand.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSo you do think he's like Hitler, or don't?"\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI'm sorry. I do think what?" asked Gonzalez, who sounded like he was calling in from a cellphone.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSo you do think he is like Hitler, or don't you?"\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNo, I didn't say that. But I think he is hateful and divisive," Gonzalez said. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd I think we need a president, we need public leaders in this country who are going to bring people together. And that's a big gripe I've had with our governor, because too often there are situations like this where he has supported this policy to begin with and then, after pressure, he reverses it."\par \par \uc2 Ah, yes. The ol' Hitler-to-Trump-to-Charlie Baker pivot.\par \par \uc2 A recent poll found the Republican led Gonzalez by 40 percentage points in a head-to-head matchup.\par \par \uc2 Both candidates face primary opponents on Sept. 4.\par \par \uc2 Joshua Miller\par \par \uc2 In primary fight, Galvin ramping up spending\par \par \uc2 After months of running a statewide campaign with few expenses, Secretary of State \uc2 William F. Galvin\uc2  is cracking open his multimillion-dollar campaign war chest.\par \par \uc2 The Brighton Democrat has hired Mara Dolan to serve as a communications consultant, making her the first person to draw regular pay from his campaign this election cycle. He's also planning on opening what Dolan said will be \u8220\'20\'1Cseveral" campaign offices, starting first in Quincy.\par \par \uc2 The moves come as Galvin faces his most serious challenge since winning his office 24 years ago, and at a time when his Democratic rival and convention-winner, Boston City Councilor Josh Zakim, has outspent him nearly 10-to-1 so far this year.\par \par \uc2 Dolan said she was a Galvin supporter before he hired her, and she praised what she called his \u8220\'20\'1Clong history of expanding voting while safeguarding our democracy" in coming aboard.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt's not just voting and elections," she said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt's securities, it's the census, historic preservation, the work he's done implementing protections for seniors. .\u160\'00\'A0.\u160\'00\'A0. He's running a strong and good campaign."\par \par \uc2 It also, so far, has been a modest one.\par \par \uc2 Galvin has shelled out just $28,535 this year, according to campaign finance records, a pittance compared to the hundreds of thousands \u8212\'20\'14 even millions \u8212\'20\'14 other statewide campaigns have spent. Through mid-June, he's reported spending nothing on office space or staff. More than half of what he's doled out \u8212\'20\'14 $15,000 \u8212\'20\'14 was paid in January to a single vendor named Opinion Services LLC, a New Jersey firm that specializes in, among other things, political and public policy polling.\par \par \uc2 Dolan said there are other expenses Galvin has incurred but has yet to report, including costs from the June 2 state Democratic convention. She said he's also in the process of hiring formal campaign staff ahead of the Sept. 4 primary. To this point, he's relied predominantly on volunteers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis tends to be his timeline when he runs," Dolan said of building his campaign. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is not an unusual pattern for him."\par \par \uc2 In 2006, the last time Galvin faced a primary challenge, he spent $101,000 through the first 5\u189\'00\'BD months of the year.\par \par \uc2 For comparison, Galvin's 2018 spending total to date is akin to what Governor \uc2 Charlie Baker\uc2 's reelection campaign spends to keep the lights on. (No, really: Baker and Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito spend a combined $25,625 per month on rent at their Allston headquarters.)\par \par \uc2 But it's not a lack of resources that's kept his spending at shoestring levels. Galvin has $2.77 million on hand, including nearly $1.9 million he's socked away into campaign savings accounts over the years. It makes him well-positioned to invest during the run-up to September. Zakim, who's spent $278,340 so far this year, has $530,129 in his account.\par \par \uc2 Dolan said she joined the campaign last Friday, meaning her salary has yet to be disclosed in campaign finance reports.\par \par \uc2 It's also not her first campaign job this cycle. She left former senator Stanley C. Rosenberg's office in the spring to join Robert K. Massie's gubernatorial campaign as his $5,500-a-month communications director.\par \par \uc2 She spent just six weeks there before leaving in May \u8212\'20\'14 a decision she said was based on \u8220\'20\'1Cfinance." Massie, who's spent $203,000 so far this year, had just $10,000 in his account as of last week.\par \par \uc2 Matt Stout\par \par \uc2 Zakim gets endorsements while Pressley waits\par \par \uc2 Following his upset win at his party's endorsement convention this month, Democrat Josh Zakim continues to rake in support from local pols \u8212\'20\'14 rounding out a trio of endorsements from his fellow city councilors in his upstart challenge to longtime Secretary of State \uc2 William F. Galvin\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the number of similar endorsements for his colleague, Ayanna Pressley, in her quest to unseat veteran US Representative Michael Capuano? That's still to be determined.\par \par \uc2 At-large City Councilor Michelle Wu was the latest to endorse Zakim, saying in a message to supporters this week that she \u8220\'20\'1Cfelt a glimmer of hope about the state of our democracy" after a round-table discussion with him on voting rights at Dudley Caf\u233\'00\'E9.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI'm proud to support Josh in his campaign for secretary of state because of his progressive plans, and because I've seen his commitment to standing up for those who don't have a voice," Wu told supporters, announcing a fund-raiser she will host for Zakim in the South End.\par \par \uc2 Councilor Matt O'Malley and Council President Andrea Campbell have also endorsed Zakim.\par \par \uc2 So far, only Councilor Annissa Essaibi-George has publicly endorsed Pressley, though first-term Councilor Kim Janey attended Pressley's campaign kickoff in February.\par \par \uc2 Political insiders note Zakim has attempted to draw policy differences between himself and Galvin. They say councilors and other pols may be waiting for Pressley to flush out her policy platform before deciding whether to endorse her campaign.\par \par \uc2 Also, they said, Zakim's upset in the party's convention \u8212\'20\'14 the first time in decades that a challenger received the endorsement over an incumbent \u8212\'20\'14 gave his allies cover to go against the longtime office-holder.\par \par \uc2 Councilors Frank Baker and Tim McCarthy have said they will be endorsing Capuano, and he has the support of Mayor \uc2 Martin J. Walsh\uc2 , who also supports Zakim.\par \par \uc2 Alex Goldstein, a spokesman for Pressley, said in a statement the campaign has released before when asked about endorsements, that their focus remains \u8220\'20\'1Cmeeting voters where they are, and engaging with them about the issues, challenges, and opportunities that mean the most to them and their families."\par \par \uc2 Milton J. Valencia\par \par \uc2 A new chapter for Setti Warren at Harvard\par \par \uc2 The governor's race didn't work out, but Setti Warren, the former Newton mayor, has landed on his feet with a nice post at Harvard.\par \par \uc2 Warren will take over as executive director of \uc2 Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy\uc2  at a time when he says the center will be focusing on some of the most serious issues facing the media.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is really an exciting time at the center," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CI'll be helping them to scale up and deal with the crisis in journalism and tackle a lot of issues: diminishing newsrooms, the problem of disinformation, the evolving digital platform."\par \par \uc2 Warren will bring to Harvard his experience serving two terms as mayor amid the tough politics of Newton.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe possesses both the high-level vision and boots-on-the-ground attention to detail that will help the \uc2 Shorenstein Center\uc2  successfully navigate the challenges and opportunities in our stage of rapid growth," said Nicco Mele, the center's director.\par \par \uc2 Warren's new job comes just two months after he dropped out of the three-way Democratic race for governor, a move that caught the political world by surprise.\par \par \uc2 At the time, he was considered the front-runner for the party nomination to face Governor \uc2 Charlie Baker\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But he said he pulled the plug on his campaign because he had concluded that his chances of beating Baker were \u8220\'20\'1Cinsurmountable."\par \par \uc2 His departure left his two rivals in the race, Patrick administration budget chief and former health care executive \uc2 Jay Gonzalez\uc2  and environmental and social activist Robert Massie, both hugely underfunded with little name-recognition among voters.\par \par \uc2 Frank Phillips\par \par \uc2 Mass. Republican leaves GOP over Trump policies\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's immigration policies have pushed another once-loyal Massachusetts Republican out of the party.\par \par \uc2 Brian Herr, the Hopkinton selectman who agreed to step up to serve as the state GOP's long-shot candidate to unseat US Senator \uc2 Edward J. Markey\uc2  in 2014, took himself off the GOP rolls this week and reregistered as an independent.\par \par \uc2 Much in the mode of \uc2 Charlie Baker\uc2 , Herr is a fiscal conservative but with liberal social positions on issues like gay marriage and abortion rights.\par \par \uc2 He agreed to join the GOP statewide ticket with Baker four years ago and lost by nearly 23 percentage points. Still, he stayed loyal to the party.\par \par \uc2 But that good will ran out this week with Trump's harsh policies of separating immigrant families.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAfter months of pain, frustration and embarrassment I have decided to leave the @GOP/ @MASSGOP," Herr posted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  this week. \u8220\'20\'1CHeaded over to Town Hall now to become an Independent. Using children to advance political agendas is immoral and sad beyond belief! Where have the positive leaders gone in the USA?"\par \par \uc2 Baker, who has kept his distance from Trump but not so much as to bolt the GOP, told reporters Thursday that he respected Herr's decision but clearly indicated he planned to stay in the party and fight for the Republican wing that produced his mentors, former governor William F. Weld and Paul Cellucci.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBrian's a really good guy," he told reporters. \u8220\'20\'1CYou know, it's a free country. People need to make whatever decisions they need to make."\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI happen to believe that the brand that I represent is what I call the Bill Weld-Paul Cellucci brand, which is a collaborative approach to governing, a fiscal discipline approach to dealing with budget issues, and a recognition that at the end of the day we need to work collaboratively with folks at the local level and with people in the private sector who can make sure we can move this Commonwealth forward," he said.\par \par \uc2 Frank Phillips\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020180622ee6m000wk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Callahan asked Gonzalez in the 9 a.m. hour of the popular talk radio show.\par \par \uc2 Uh oh!\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CUmm," Gonzalez paused. \u8220\'20\'1CI think Trump's a terrible president, and I think he's divisive, and I think he's hateful. I don't like that we have a president that mocks people with disabilities, assaults women, and takes this anti-immigrant stance to the extent that he has\u8212\'20\'14"\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI would call it anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," Callahan chimed in.\par \par \uc2 Then Callahan got back to the question at hand.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSo you do think he's like Hitler, or don't?"\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI'm sorry. I do think what?" asked Gonzalez, who sounded like he was calling in from a cell phone.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSo you do think he is like Hitler, or don't you?"\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNo, I didn't say that. But I think he is hateful and divisive," Gonzalez said. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd I think we need a president, we need public leaders in this country who are going to bring people together. And that's a big gripe I've had with our governor, because too often there are situations like this where he has supported this policy to begin with and then, after pressure, he reverses it."\par \par \uc2 Ah, yes. The ol' Hitler-to-Trump-to-Charlie Baker pivot.\par \par \uc2 A recent poll found the Republican led Gonzalez by 40 percentage points in a head-to-head matchup.\par \par \uc2 Both candidates face primary opponents on Sept. 4.\par \par \uc2 Reach Miller at joshua.miller@globe.com\par \par \uc2 Credit: By Joshua Miller Globe Staff\par \par \uc2 Caption:\par \par \uc2 Candidate for governor \uc2 Jay Gonzalez\uc2  speaks during the 2018 Massachusetts Democratic Party Convention in June.Candidate for governor \uc2 Jay Gonzalez\uc2  speaks during the 2018 Massachusetts Democratic Party Convention in June.\par \par \uc2 Michael Dwyer/APMichael Dwyer/AP\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020180621ee6l001b9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A cool, calm, and collected head of Homeland Security fired back at reporters who questioned the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the US-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 Here's a White House transcript of Monday's press briefing, in which press secretary \uc2 Sarah Sanders\uc2  also spoke.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. As you know, President Trump has laid out an immigration reform proposal that closes loopholes and provides the necessary resources to secure the border.\par \par \uc2 Congress needs to fix our broken immigration system. To answer some of your questions on this topic, I've invited Secretary of Homeland Security, \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2 , and the \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2  Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to the podium.\par \par \uc2 And, as always, I'll be back up afterwards to take questions on other news of the day. Thanks.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: Well, good afternoon. It is my pleasure to be here because I would love to see if I can help explain some of what's going on and give you some of the facts. I know there have been a lot put out there, but hopefully we can clarify some things today.\par \par \uc2 I just wanted to start by thanking the sheriffs of the United States. I had the privilege of speaking to them this morning at the National Sheriffs' Association Conference. We are so thankful for their partnership at DHS and all they do to protect our community. So I thank them.\par \par \uc2 So I want to provide you an update on the illegal immigration crisis on our southern border and the effects -- the efforts the administration is taking to solve this crisis and to stop the flood of illegal immigrants, drugs, contraband, and crime coming across the border.\par \par \uc2 So let's just start with a few numbers and facts. So in the last three months, we have seen illegal immigration on our southern border exceed 50,000 people each month. Multiples over each month last year.\par \par \uc2 Since this time last year, there has been a 325 percent increase in unaccompanied alien children and a 435 percent increase in family units entering the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Over the last 10 years, there has been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims, resulting in asylum backlog to date, on our country, of 600,000 cases.\par \par \uc2 Since 2013, the United States has admitted more than half a million \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  minors and family units from Central America, most of whom today are at large in the United States. At the same time, large criminal organizations such as MS-13 have violated our borders and gained a deadly foothold within the United States.\par \par \uc2 This entire crisis, just to be clear, is not new. It's been occurring and expanded over many decades. But currently, it is the exclusive product of loopholes in our federal immigration laws that prevent \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  minors and family members from being detained and removed to their home countries.\par \par \uc2 In other words, these loopholes create a functionally open border. Apprehension without detention and removal is not border security. We have repeatedly called on Congress to close these loopholes. I, myself, have met with as many members have been willing to meet with me. I've testified seven times. I will continue to make myself available to ask that they work with us to solve this crisis.\par \par \uc2 Yet the voices most loudly criticizing the enforcement of our current laws are those whose policies created this crisis and whose policies perpetrate it.\par \par \uc2 In particular, we need to reform three major loopholes. Let me quickly walk you through them. First, we need to amend the 2008 Trafficking Victims Prevention Reauthorization Act, or TVPR -- which is much easier to say. This law encourages families to put children in the hands of smugglers to bring them alone on this dangerous trek northward. And make no mistake, we've talked about this before -- this trek is dangerous and deadly.\par \par \uc2 Second, we need to reform our asylum laws to end the systemic abuse of our asylum system and stop fraud. Right now, our asylum system fails to assist asylum seekers who legitimately need it. We are a country of compassion. We are a country of heart. We must fix the system so that those who truly need asylum can, in fact, receive it.\par \par \uc2 Third, we need to amend the Flores Settlement Agreement and recent expansions which currently allow for -- which would allow for family detention during the removal process. And we need Congress to fully fund our ability to hold families together through the immigration process.\par \par \uc2 Until these loopholes are closed by Congress, it is not possible, as a matter of law, to detain and remove whole family units who arrive illegally in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Congress and the courts created this problem, and Congress alone can fix it. Until then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States. Those who criticize the enforcement of our laws have offered only one countermeasure: open borders; the quick release of all illegal alien families and the decision not to enforce our laws. This policy would be disastrous. Its prime beneficiaries would be the smuggling organizations themselves, and the prime victims would be the children who would be plunged into the smuggling machines and get gang recruitment on the trip north.\par \par \uc2 There's a lot of misinformation about what DHS is and is not doing as it relates to families at the border and I want to correct the record. Here are the facts:\par \par \uc2 First, this administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border. We have a statutory responsibility that we take seriously to protect alien children from human smuggling, trafficking, and other criminal actions while enforcing our immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 We have a long-existing policy. Multiple administrations have followed that outline when we may take action to protect children. We will separate those who claim to be a parent and child if we cannot determine a familial or custodial relationship exists.\par \par \uc2 For example, if there's no documentation to confirm the claimed relationship between an adult and a child, we do so if the parent is a national security, public or safety risk, including when there are criminal charges at issue and it may not be appropriate to maintain the family in detention together.\par \par \uc2 We also separate a parent and child if the adult is suspected of human trafficking. There have been cases where minors have been used and trafficked by unrelated adults in an effort to avoid detention. And I'd stop here to say, in the last five months, we have a 314 percent increase in adults and children arriving at the border, fraudulently claiming to be a family unit. This is, obviously, of concern.\par \par \uc2 And separation can occur when the parent is charged with human smuggling. Under those circumstances, we would detain the parent in an appropriate secure detention facility separate from the child.\par \par \uc2 What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law. Everyone is subject to prosecution. When DHS refers a case against a parent or legal guardian for criminal prosecution, the parent or legal guardian will be placed into the \uc2 U.S. Marshals Service\uc2  custody for pretrial determination, pursuant to an order by a federal judge. And any accompanied child will be transferred to the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  and will be reclassified as an unaccompanied alien child. That is in accordance with the TVPRA -- a law that was passed by Congress -- and a following court order, neither which are actions the Trump administration has taken.\par \par \uc2 And let's be clear: If an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States, they would go to jail and they would be separated from their family. This is not a controversial idea.\par \par \uc2 Second, children in DHS and \uc2 HHS\uc2  custody are being well taken care of. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement provides meals, medical care, and educational services to these children. They are provided temporary shelter. And \uc2 HHS\uc2  works hard to find a parent, relative, or foster home to care for these children. Parents can still communicate with their children through phone calls and video conferencing.\par \par \uc2 And a parent who is released from custody can be a sponsor and ask \uc2 HHS\uc2  to release the child back into their care. Further, these minors can still apply for asylum and other protections under U.S. immigration law, if eligible.\par \par \uc2 We take allegations of mistreatment seriously. And I want to stress this point: We investigate. We hold those accountable when, and if, it should occur. We have some of the highest detention standards in the country. Claiming these children and their parents are treated inhumanely is not true and completely disrespects the hardworking men and women at the \uc2 Office of Refugee Resettlement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Third, parents who entered illegally are, by definition, criminals. Illegal entry is a crime as determined by Congress. By entering our country illegally, often in dangerous circumstances, illegal immigrants have put their children at risk.\par \par \uc2 Fourth, CBP and ICE officers are properly trained to care for minors in their custody. DHS and \uc2 HHS\uc2  treats all individuals in its custody with dignity and respect, and complies with all laws and policy. This reinforces and reiterates the needs to consider the best interest of the children, and mandates adherence to establish protocols to protect at-risk populations, to include standards for the transport and treatment of minors in DHS and \uc2 HHS\uc2  custody.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, all U.S. Border Patrol personnel in the southwest border are bilingual -- every last one of them. They are directed to clearly explain the relevant process to apprehended individuals, and provide detainees with written documentation in both Spanish and English that lays out the process and appropriate phone numbers to contact.\par \par \uc2 And finally, DHS is not separating families legitimately seeking asylum at ports of entry. If an adult enters at a port of entry and claims asylum, they will not face prosecution for illegal entry. They have not committed a crime by coming to the port of entry.\par \par \uc2 As I mentioned, DHS does have a responsibility to protect minors. And in that case, as well, we will only separate the family if we cannot determine there is a familiar relationship, if the child may be at risk with the parent or legal guardian, or if the parent or legal guardian is referred for prosecution.\par \par \uc2 We have a duty to protect the American people, and it's one that I take very seriously. Here is the bottom line: DHS is no longer ignoring the law. We are enforcing the laws as they exist on the books. As long as illegal entry remains a criminal offense, DHS will not look the other way. DHS will faithfully execute the laws enacted by Congress, as we are sworn to do.\par \par \uc2 As I said earlier today, surely it is the beginning of the unraveling of democracy when the body who makes the laws, instead of changing them, tells the enforcement body not to enforce the law. I ask Congress to act this week so that we can secure our borders and uphold our humanitarian ideas. These two missions should not be pitted against each other. If we close the loopholes, we can accomplish both.\par \par \uc2 Before I take questions, I just want to ask that, in your reporting, please consider the men and women of DHS who are dedicated law enforcement officers and who often put their lives at risk. Let's remember their sacrifice and commitment to this country.\par \par \uc2 And with that, I'll take some questions. Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q Secretary Nielsen, if you could, what you talked about there -- DHS is no longer ignoring the law -- you're calling on Congress to change the law.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q I mean, that is the big message here. Members of Congress on the Democratic side say that you're using children as a lever to try to get them to take legislative action. What do you say to that?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: I say that is a very cowardly response. It's clearly within their power to make the laws and change the laws. They should do so.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q Have you seen the photos of children in cages? Have you heard the audio clip of these children wailing, that just came out today?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: I have not seen -- as something that came out today. But I have been to detention centers. And again, I would reference you to our standards. I would reference you to the care provided not just by the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  but by the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  when they get to \uc2 HHS\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Q But is that the image of this country that you want out there -- children in cages?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: The image that I want of this country is an immigration system that secures our borders and upholds our humanitarian ideals. Congress needs to fix it.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q Madam Secretary, I'd like to give you a chance to respond to \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2 . In an op-ed, she says this is cruel. She supports an application of the law. Even the current First Lady, Melania Trump, has said we should be a nation of laws; we should do so \u8220\'20\'1Cwith heart." Do you have anything you want to tell them? Do you believe they're misunderstanding the situation? Or do you believe there's any component of this policy which, as you've outlined, other administrations have done, but you're using in a way that is more intense and creates this separation issue?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: What my response would be is, is calling attention to this matter is important. This is a very serious issue that has resulted after years and years of Congress not taking action. So I would thank them both for their comments. I would thank them both for their concerns. I share their concerns. But Congress is the one that needs to fix this.\par \par \uc2 Q And this policy is not, by your definition, in any way, cruel?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: It's not a policy. Our policy at DHS is to do what we're sworn to do, which is to enforce the law.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q Following up on Major's question there, Former First Lady \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2  compared this to Japanese internment during World War II -- one of the darkest days in the nation's history. Do you believe that the effect of this policy -- so not the law -- but the effect of it on separating children from families in those specific instances is moral, is ethical, is American?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: What I believe is that we should exercise our democratic rights as Americans and fix the problem. It's a problem; let's fix it.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q How is this not child abuse?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: Which? Be more specific, please. Enforcing the law?\par \par \uc2 Q The images that Cecilia was talking about, and the sounds that we've seen from these big box stores -- the Walmarts, the other stores -- when you see this, how is this not specifically child abuse for these innocent children who are indeed being separated from their parents?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: So I want to be clear on a couple other things. The vast majority -- vast, vast majority -- of children who are in the care of \uc2 HHS\uc2  right now -- 10,000 of the 12,000 -- were sent here alone by their parents. That's when they were separated. So somehow, we've conflated everything.\par \par \uc2 But there's two separate issues. Ten thousand of those currently in custody were sent by their parents, with strangers, to undertake a completely dangerous and deadly travel alone. We now care for them. We have high standards. We give them meals. We give them education. We give them medical care. There's videos; there's TVs. I've visited the detention centers myself. That would be my answer to that question.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q If I could follow up, though. For the hundreds that are not included in there -- you said 10,000 -- but for the hundreds that we have seen -- perhaps up to 2,000 -- are there any examples of child abuse, do you believe? And how could this not be child abuse for the people who are taken from their parents? Not the ones who are sent here, with their parents' blessing, with a smuggler, but the people who are taken from their parents?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: Unfortunately, I am not in any position to deal with hearsay stories. If someone has a specific allegation, as I always do when I testify, I ask that they provide that information to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . We will look into it. Of course, we do not want any situation where a child is not completely adequately taken care of.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q A couple of questions. One, why is the government only releasing images of the boys who are being held? Where are the girls? Where are the young toddlers?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: I don't know. I am not familiar with those particular images.\par \par \uc2 Q You don't know where they are? Do you know where the girls are? Do you know where the young toddlers are?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: We have children in DHS care -- both. But as you know, most of the children, after 72 hours, are transferred to \uc2 HHS\uc2 . So I don't know what pictures you're referencing, but I'd have to refer you to \uc2 HHS\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Q We've seen images of boys, but we just haven't seen any of the girls or any of the young toddlers. And you're saying that they are being well cared for. So how can you make that claim if you don't know where they are?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: It's not that I don't know where they are. I'm saying that the vast majority are held by \uc2 Health and Human Services\uc2 . We transfer them after 72 hours. I don't know what pictures you're speaking about, but perhaps there are --\par \par \uc2 Q The pictures have been released to public; they've been aired all over national television.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: Okay. By DHS? Or by \uc2 HHS\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 Q By DHS.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: Okay. So let's find out from \uc2 HHS\uc2 . I don't think there's anything other than (inaudible) pictures.\par \par \uc2 Q They were released by your department. I mean, they've been aired all over national television throughout the day -- the kids who are being held in the cages. We've only seen the boys.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: I will look into that. I'm not aware that there is another picture.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q Secretary, let me just follow up very quickly, because you continue to insist that this is something that Congress can change --\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q -- and yet this is something that was enacted after the Attorney General announced the zero-tolerance policy. This never happened before he announced the zero-tolerance policy.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: That's actually not true. So the last administration --\par \par \uc2 Q Well, we've never seen this under previous administrations.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: -- the Obama administration, the Bush administration all separated families at the --\par \par \uc2 Q We didn't see kids separated from their parents.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: They absolutely did. They did -- their rate was less than ours, but they absolutely did do this. This is not new.\par \par \uc2 Q There were unaccompanied minors, there's no doubt about that. But this --\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: They separated families.\par \par \uc2 Q -- separating kids at this rate from their parents is something new and specific to this administration once the Attorney General announced the zero-tolerance policy. So why doesn't the President pick up the phone and change the policy? He said he hates it.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: I think what the President is trying to do is find a long-term fix. So why don't we have Congress changes the laws to change --\par \par \uc2 Q (Inaudible.)\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: No. Congress could fix this tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 Yes. I think you were next, right?\par \par \uc2 Q Yeah. Madam Secretary, President Trump has had a lot to say the last few days about immigration, but he's offered no compassion to the families that are being separated at the border. Do you know why that is? And why won't he simply pause your department's enforcement of this administration policy until Congress reaches that long-term fix so that these families can be reunited?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: He has been attempting to work with Congress since he's been in office. He's made it very clear that we will enforce the laws of the United States as long as this administration is here. As part of that, he has continually reached out to Congress to fix this. And I think what you've seen him do in the last few days is that: is continue to tell Congress, \u8220\'20\'1CPlease work with us." The system is broken. The only people that benefit from the system right now are the smugglers, the traffickers, those who are pedaling drugs, and terrorists. So let's fix the system.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q That didn't answer the question. And does he feel any compassion for the families that are being separated? He has talked about the parents being possible criminals. He has blamed it on Democrats. He has offered no words of compassion.\par \par \uc2 THE PRESIDENT: I think he has said in tweets that he would like Congress to act to end the underlying laws that require the separation.\par \par \uc2 Q Madam Secretary, it seemed like a couple days ago, both the President and in your tweets, that the main posture or point was to say that this is not the administration's policy. But it seems like, in the last couple -- well, today -- that the message is a little different; is to say, well, this is our policy, but it's our policy because either we believe it's a deterrent or we don't believe we have the resources to move families entirely.\par \par \uc2 And I'm just wondering -- I want to make sure we get the reporting right -- which of those is the most precise way to describe how the administration feels? And given the blowback by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats, are you considering rethinking this based on feedback? Or is this the administration's position going forward -- period, paragraph?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: The laws prohibit us from detaining families while they go through prosecution for illegally entering the border, and while they go through prosecutions for immigration proceedings. If we close the loopholes, we can keep the families together, which is what they did in the last administration until a court ruled that we can no longer do that. After 20 days, we have to release both unaccompanied children and accompanied children -- which means that we cannot detain families together. The only option is to not enforce the law at all.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q Okay, so going back to these two questions from Kristen and Margaret, you said that you want Congress to close some loopholes. With that, you also said that you want to make this work. Now, are these kids being used as pawns for a wall? Many people are asking that. And Democrats are saying this is your discretion and there is no law that says that this White House can separate parents from their children.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: The kids are being used by pawns by the smugglers and the traffickers. Again, let's just pause to think about this statistic: 314 percent increase in adults showing up with kids that are not a family unit. Those are traffickers, those are smugglers. That is MS-13. Those are criminals and those are abusers.\par \par \uc2 Q When did --\par \par \uc2 Q Just let her finish.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: So -- thank you. All I'm trying to say is, closing that loophole will enable us to detain families together throughout the proceeding as they've done in previous administrations.\par \par \uc2 Q Madam Secretary. Madam Secretary, can you definitively say, are the children being used as pawns against --- for a wall. Yes or no? Can you say yes or no to that?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: The children are not being used as a pawn. We are trying to protect the children, which is why I'm asking Congress to act.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q (Inaudible) as the legal framework for the decisions that your administration has made. What we're seeing -- the pictures, the audio, the stories -- are they an intended consequence of the administration's decision-making or an unintended consequence?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: I think that they reflect the focus of those who post such pictures and narratives. The narratives we don't see are the narratives of the crime, of the opioids, of the smugglers, of people who are killed by gang members, of American children who are recruited, and then, when they lose the drugs, they're tased and beaten.\par \par \uc2 So we don't have a balanced view of what's happening. But what's happening at the border is the border is being overrun by those who have no right to cross it. As I said before, if you're seeking asylum, go to a port of entry. You do not need to break the law of the United States to seek asylum.\par \par \uc2 Q People are being turned away from ports of entry, Madam Secretary.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: That actually is incorrect. We have limited resources. We have multiple missions at CBP. And what we do is, based on the very high standards we have, if we do not have enough bed space, if we do not have enough medical personnel on staff, if we do have enough caretakers on staff, then we will tell people that come to the border they need to come back. We are not turning them away. We are saying: We want to take care of you in the right way; right now, we do not have the resources at this particular moment in time. Come back.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you very much. Are you intending for this to play out as it is playing out? Are you intending for parents to be separated from their children? Are you intending to send a message?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: I find that offensive. No. Because why would I ever create a policy that purposely does that?\par \par \uc2 Q Perhaps as a deterrent.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: No.\par \par \uc2 Q AG Sessions says it was a deterrent.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: The way that it works --\par \par \uc2 Q The Attorney General said it was a deterrent.\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: That's not the question that you asked me.\par \par \uc2 But the answer is, it's a law passed by the \uc2 United States Congress\uc2 . Rather than fixing the law, Congress is asking those of us who enforce the law to turn our backs on the law and not enforce the law. It's not an answer. The answer is to fix the laws.\par \par \uc2 Q Will the administration refrain from its current policy if Congress were to pass something that's close to what you want? Or will it continue to require the separation of parents from their children until the President gets exactly what he wants?\par \par \uc2 SECRETARY NIELSEN: If Congress closes the loopholes, some of which -- many of which are closed in the two bills that we hope are taken up this week by the House, then they close the loopholes and the families will stay together throughout the proceedings.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Thank you, Secretary Nielsen.\par \par \uc2 I'll jump right in and go to other questions, news of the day.\par \par \uc2 Steve.\par \par \uc2 Q The President said he would talk with the North Korean leader, Kim, yesterday. Do you know if that happened?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I know the President has spoken with a number of administration officials that are working on the details following the North Korean summit, and we'll keep you posted on those details. But I'm not aware of a specific call between the two leaders at this time.\par \par \uc2 Q To follow up -- there's a report that the United States and South Korea have agreed to suspend joint military drills in August. Is that real?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last part of the question.\par \par \uc2 Q That they've agreed to suspend joint military drills in August. Are you aware of this? Is this true?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Those conversations are ongoing at this point. As long as the North Koreans continue to act in good faith, as we saw in Singapore, then we expect those things to be on pause at this point.\par \par \uc2 Bill.\par \par \uc2 Q Yes, Sarah. Has the President discussed the family separation policy with the First Lady, in light of her statement yesterday? And does he have any plans to come out and address the American people? Maybe take some questions about how his administration is enforcing the policy.\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: The President did take a number of questions, as I'm sure you're all aware, on Friday, in which -- what he actually said very closely mirrored what the First Lady said. He said he hates seeing this. He's called on Congress -- not just Friday, but for months -- he's called on Democrats in Congress to work with him; let's fix this problem. The President isn't trying to kick the can down the road. He's actually trying to work with Congress to get real solutions and to fix the problem, and that's what we're doing.\par \par \uc2 Jeff. And I'll take your question since you and your network falsely accused me of not wanting to be here. So I'll be glad to pass that question on to you now.\par \par \uc2 Q Why did you decide to have Secretary Nielsen answer questions instead of you?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm here answering questions as well, but I thought it was important for the Secretary, one of the primary experts on this process and the things that are going on, to come out here and have the chance to speak to you and for you guys to be able to ask questions directly of her and the leaders in this administration.\par \par \uc2 But I'm standing here in front of you.\par \par \uc2 Q I have a real question, though. Would the President sign a bill that did not --\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I wondered if you were going to throw it away.\par \par \uc2 Q Would the President sign a bill that did not include border funding if it did indeed close this loophole that Secretary Nielsen talked about? Would he sign that specific bill? Or does he require an entire bill with that $25 billion in border funding?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: We've laid out what we would like to see on a number of different occasions. There are currently two bills that are in process in the House. The President supports both of those pieces of legislation that we have voiced support for the details in those.\par \par \uc2 The President doesn't just want to see a Band-Aid put on this. He wants us to actually fix our immigration system. He's tired of administrations claiming that they want to help the system and then just kicking the can down the road. He wants to actually fix the problems. He wants to secure our border. This isn't just something we can tinker with. We have to actually fix the entire system, and he's committed to doing that.\par \par \uc2 Q He would require border funding then?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Again, we've laid out what we would want to see in legislation. The President wants to fix the system and we're committed to doing that. And we hope Congress will actually do their part. Democrats have got to stop playing political games and actually come to the table and get real about solving the problem.\par \par \uc2 John.\par \par \uc2 Q Thanks. On the IG report and the hearings in Congress with Mr. Horowitz and Director Wray: The President tweeted several times, today and yesterday, that the Mueller investigation continues to be \u8220\'20\'1Ca witch hunt." He said on Friday that, after reviewing the IG report, it shows that there's no evidence of collusion. His own FBI Director today said that Mueller is not on a witch hunt and that the report doesn't speak to the special counsel investigation. How is there that disconnect there between what the President believes another branch of his administration is doing?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: The President has been clear. He was obviously very involved in his campaign, and he's laid out a number of times that there was no collusion, and he strongly feels this is a witch hunt. The President has also said that the IG report clearly calls into question the credibility of \uc2 James Comey\uc2  and many other senior \uc2 FBI\uc2  investigators who have been involved in the Russia investigation, and that report validates the claims that he's made repeatedly.\par \par \uc2 Dave.\par \par \uc2 Q Thanks, Sarah. The governor of Massachusetts, who's a Republican, today reversed course and ordered the National Guard not to send assets or personnel to southwest border because he said, in his words, actions of the federal government \u8220\'20\'1Care resulting in the inhumane treatment of children." Would you comment on that? And have you seen any other impact on border operations from this whole situation?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I haven't seen his comments specifically, but I would tell him that he should call every member of Congress, particularly those in his own state, and ask them to fix the laws.\par \par \uc2 There's only one body here that gets to create legislation and it's Congress. Our job is to enforce it, and we would like to see Congress fix it. That's why the President has repeatedly called on them to work with him to do just that.\par \par \uc2 Deborah.\par \par \uc2 Q Sarah, what was the President's reaction to \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2 's piece in the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, what was the last part of your question?\par \par \uc2 Q What was the President's reaction to \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2 's piece in the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I didn't speak directly with him about that, but I'm happy to address the concerns and echo what Secretary Nielsen said. Look, we share the concern. The President himself said that he doesn't like this process.\par \par \uc2 But once again, it's Congress' job to change the law. We're calling on them to do exactly that. And frankly, this law was actually signed into effect in 2008 under her husband's leadership, not under this administration. We're not the ones responsible for creating this problem. We've inherited it. But we're actually the first administration stepping up and trying to fix it.\par \par \uc2 John.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you, Sarah. I have here in my hands figures from the \uc2 German Ministry of the Interior\uc2 , under Minister Seehofer, who says that crime has gone down 5.1 percent in Germany. In fact, it's the lowest rate in a quarter century in Germany -- violent crime down 2.4 percent, burglary down 23 percent, and theft down 11.8 percent. Where did the President get the statement that crime was way up in Germany under the Merkel plan for admitting refugees?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of the report that you're referencing, but I'd be happy to check into it, and circle back to you.\par \par \uc2 Q It's from the \uc2 German Ministry of the Interior\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I heard that part, but I haven't seen it. But I'll be happy to check into it and circle back.\par \par \uc2 Jon.\par \par \uc2 Q Thanks a lot, Sarah. I read the First Lady's statement that was put out and she seems very troubled by this zero-tolerance policy. Is there any daylight between the President and the First Lady on this issue?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I think we've made it abundantly clear that the daylight exists between Democrats in Congress and their ability to change this law. The President himself said that he doesn't -- he hates these images; he hates this process. And that's why he's asked for it to be fixed.\par \par \uc2 I feel like we keep ignoring the fact that the President isn't the one that creates the law, but it's Congress' job to create the law. And the President has already laid out and gladly stated, a number of times, publicly, that he would sign legislation that fixes these loopholes and fixes our immigration system.\par \par \uc2 I think that people should be begging and banging down the doors of Congress and asking them to join with the President instead of fighting him. Instead of constantly criticizing it, why aren't they offering solutions?\par \par \uc2 And you have people like \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  and \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2  who come out and complain and attack. It's because they have no message. They have no solutions. We've laid out a solution and we'd like to see them work with us to put it in place.\par \par \uc2 Steve.\par \par \uc2 Q Also critical of this particular policy, besides the people that you mentioned on the Democratic side, are a number of Republicans, and also some very prominent members of some of the President's base -- evangelical Christians. Do you know if the President has heard from those members of his base? Evangelicals, in particular -- had discussions with the President about this particular policy? And can you sort of fill us in on discussions the President may have had in that regard?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: I think any evangelical that -- or in any church for that matter -- that feels strongly, they should open up their doors and help facilitate some of these individuals. I think that's their calling, that's the mission of the church, and they should certainly fulfill that. If they want to fix the immigration system, then they should call their members of Congress and ask them to join with us to do that.\par \par \uc2 Steve.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Q Sarah, can you just --\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Sorry, Steve. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Q There's some confusion about this Space Force that the President announced today. Did he actually sign anything? Does he believe that this can be done without the approval of Congress? The Air Force appears opposed to it. Where is the support for this coming from besides the President?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: The President has asked the Department of Defense to start the process. We're in the beginning stages of it, and we're going to work with the Department of Defense and the other relevant parties to put it into place.\par \par \uc2 Francesca.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you, Sarah. If the administration is, as it says, not using the children as pawns in this situation, then why not just have Congress pass legislation that narrowly deals with this family separation issue, and sign it, and then deal with the other aspects of the immigration system that the President wants to overhaul at a different time?\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: Once again, we want to fix the entire system. We don't want to just tinker with it. The President is tired of watching people kick it down the road and not take responsibility and not fix the problems that we have.\par \par \uc2 Q I understand, ideally, Sarah, that you would like to see all these other things change about the immigration system. But we're dealing with this particular situation right now. Why not --\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: We're dealing with a number of situations. That's not the only one. We have people flooding over the borders. Look, the President wants people to come to this country, but we want them to come legally and through the right process. And that's what we're asking. We want to secure the border.\par \par \uc2 There have been a number of individuals that are permanently separated from their families due to the illegal aliens that have come across this border and murdered and killed American citizens. Where is the outrage over that separation? We want to fix the whole thing. We don't want to just tinker with one part of it. This is a broken system, and we've got to quit ignoring it. Just ignoring the rule doesn't fix it, and that's what this administration is actually trying to do.\par \par \uc2 I'm going to take one last question. Saagar.\par \par \uc2 Q Thank you, Sarah. So Secretary Pompeo came out today and he said that, in exchange for denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, that the United States had committed to updating the armistice agreement that's currently in place. Can you confirm that the President did make this commitment to \uc2 Kim Jong Un\uc2 ? And what exactly does updating the armistice mean? Does it put the future of U.S. forces on the Korean Peninsula in question? And just any more information you could update us on in that regard.\par \par \uc2 MS. SANDERS: We're finalizing the details of what the process will look like. Certainly would confirm Secretary Pompeo's comments. And would refer you to the State Department and the Department of Defense, who will be putting those details out and together.\par \par \uc2 Thanks so much, guys. Have a great day.\par \par \uc2 Credit: Globe Staff\par \par \uc2 Caption:\par \par \uc2 Journalists raised their hands to ask Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen questions during the daily briefing on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020180619ee6i00036\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Dario Guerrero took his mom to Mexico when she was dying. It cost him his DACA status.\par \par \uc2 DARIO GUERRERO WAS FINISHING HIS HOMEWORK in the library at the California Academy of Mathematics and Science when his phone buzzed in late December 2010. Dario, like the children of most undocumented immigrants, had followed the DREAM Act vote in the Senate, but only barely. He'd been focused on school and sports and college applications.\par \par \uc2 Dario looked down, puzzled. It was a Boston area code. His heart began to race. He took the call and ran out to the front steps of the library.\par \par \uc2 An admissions officer from \uc2 Harvard University\uc2  broke the good news. Dario had won an undergraduate spot, with enough financial aid to cover tuition, room, and board. A letter confirming the admission was on its way. Dario's mouth hung open.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThank you. Thank you. Thank you!" Dario repeated. He couldn't think of anything else to say. He hung up the phone and jumped into the air, pumping his fist above him as he let out a whoop of joy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou did it. Mijo, you did it!" Dario Sr. cried that night. The DREAM Act, first proposed in 2001 as a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who had come to this country as children with their parents, had failed yet again to pass, this time by five votes. But surely now, his soon-to-be-college-student son was safe from deportation.\par \par \uc2 Dario hadn't even known he was undocumented for most of his life, until he discovered that the Social Security number he was using belonged to his younger brother, who was born in the United States. But by September 2011, Dario felt he was finally starting life, freed from that box of \u8220\'20\'1C\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ." From here on, his identity would be \u8220\'20\'1CHarvard student."\par \par \uc2 One night late in the fall of his freshman year, Dario hung out in the Harvard dorms with a few friends. One, the son of a banking executive, offered to take them all to a rave in the Netherlands on his father's private plane.\par \par \uc2 Sure, they all laughed, let's do it. Dario looked over at his roommate Alex, who was from South Carolina, and like Dario found the whole scene both awe-inspiring and ridiculous. Alex raised an eyebrow. Was this kid serious?\par \par \uc2 A couple of guys leaned forward, calculating the cost, joking about where they'd stashed their passports. Dario nodded along. Even on a free plane with room and board taken care of, there was no way on earth he'd be able to go. He had no passport. He couldn't leave the country, not if he wanted to ever get back in.\par \par \uc2 He scoffed. Raves were lame, he said.\par \par \uc2 Dario's girlfriend had gotten him to go to some Latino student events on campus. They even talked, mostly in jest, about getting married so he could adjust his status.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CDude, why are you getting married?" Alex yelled when he overheard the plan. \u8220\'20\'1CYou're 18!" That night, Dario told Alex about his immigration status.\par \par \uc2 At first, Alex didn't believe him. \u8220\'20\'1CI had no idea people who were undocumented could go to college, and to Harvard," Alex said later. Alex's own father was from Syria, a doctor who'd gotten a green card through a visa program for physicians willing to work in underserved communities. Alex's father spoke sympathetically about the plight of the undocumented, mostly farmworkers who were flocking to South Carolina looking for work. His mother, a US native, not so much. She wondered why they didn't just get in line and do it the right way.\par \par \uc2 Dario told Alex that since his father wasn't a doctor, nor did he have a million dollars to invest in a company, there wasn't really a \u8220\'20\'1Cright way to come." The line for most Mexicans was literally a lifetime long. His parents did pay taxes. Only, unlike Americans, they were unlikely to get back any of the money they put into the system when they retired.\par \par \uc2 Dario and his girlfriend broke up. He and Alex started hanging around more. Dario confided in Alex about a film he had started his senior year with other undocumented friends about applying for college without papers. Alex was fascinated. He offered to help. Together, they could make a full-length documentary. Maybe, said Dario. He'd wanted to come to Harvard precisely so he wouldn't have to think about what his immigration status meant anymore. He joined the boxing club. He partied alongside all the other first-years.\par \par \uc2 Many of his friends held odd jobs on campus or off to pay their way, or for spending money. Dario couldn't get a job \u8212\'20\'14 on the books, anyway.\par \par \uc2 Alex and Dario stayed up late drinking beer and mapping out ideas for a film following undocumented students at Harvard. Dario found nearly a dozen, including graduate students, mostly through word of mouth. But few wanted their faces on camera. They were scared of what it would mean for them, their families, and for Harvard were they to go public.\par \par \uc2 Their fears weren't unfounded. In the wake of the DREAM Act's failure, United We Dream, a youth-led immigrant activist organization, had documented more than 30 cases of DREAM Act-eligible students who had been detained and put in deportation hearings. By the fall of 2011, the Obama administration was on track to deport nearly 400,000 people annually, a record. Students continued to be among those rounded up. Immigrant leaders struggled to reconcile the president they had campaigned for with Obama's stepped-up deportation program. Stricter enforcement hadn't brought Congress any closer to taking action on the DREAMers, and even if it had, it would not have stopped their siblings and parents from being deported.\par \par \uc2 As the action shifted back to the states with Congress gridlocked, young immigrant activists were loud and unapologetic. In many ways, the failure of the DREAM Act had freed them from the image Congress seemed to demand of them. Presenting the story of the perfect, well-mannered student hadn't worked. Now they could just be human.\par \par \uc2 The young activists would make national headlines confronting politicians, including GOP presidential candidate \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  at a fund-raiser in New York City, where a Peruvian native, Lucia Allain, asked Romney about his dislike of the DREAM Act on camera. It went viral. These activists could get away with the confrontations precisely because, unlike their parents, they had no accents, and could often blend into a crowd of political supporters.\par \par \uc2 In late January 2012, a few days before Florida's GOP presidential primary, the state's freshman US senator, Marco Rubio, addressed the Republican-backed Hispanic Leadership Network in Miami in his first major speech on immigration, arguing a national consensus existed in favor of helping out young DREAMers. \u8220\'20\'1CThere is broad bipartisan support for the notion that we should figure out a way to accommodate them," Rubio said.\par \par \uc2 THE MORNING OF JUNE 15, 2012, the president strode out onto the steps of the White House and into the Rose Garden, where he unveiled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the most dramatic immigration reform the United States had seen in nearly three decades. Young people who came to the United States before the age of 16; were currently 30 or younger; had been physically present in the country for the past five years; and were in school, had graduated from high school, or had joined the military would be eligible to work and in many states to drive. They would no longer have to fear that any interaction with police could lead to deportation. \u8220\'20\'1CIt makes no sense to expel talented young people who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans," the president said.\par \par \uc2 It was estimated that more than 1 million people would be affected by the order (the number to date is closer to 800,000).\par \par \uc2 In Long Beach, Dario's mother shrieked from the living room and ran to wake her son, home from college and sleeping late. Dario sat up. His first thought: \u8220\'20\'1CThank God I didn't get married." His mind flashed to all the things he wanted to do: Get a driver's license, find a job to help his parents, and maybe study abroad.\par \par \uc2 In Los Angeles, during a protest in front of the downtown immigrant detention facility, dozens of youth stopped chanting and waving their signs and stood in a circle holding hands, savoring for just a few quiet minutes the unexpected victory.\par \par \uc2 LIFE IN CAMBRIDGE changed for Dario after DACA. He landed a position at a campus-affiliated bar, then a job at the massive Widener Library's audiovisual department. He began to enjoy more of the privileges of school. Armed with DACA, undocumented students on campus became more willing to talk for his film project.\par \par \uc2 Then in the late fall of his junior year, his father called. His mother was sick. It was most likely cancer. In January 2014, Dario took a leave of absence from Harvard.\par \par \uc2 He began using his university-level research skills to find alternative cures. He tore up the family's traditional menu of carne, rice, and veggies. He invested in an industrial-strength juicer, filming its first use for a project about his mom, as orange carrot juice went flying in his hair.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe first to vomit loses!" they joked after Dario whipped up his first cleanser, and mother and son clinked their glasses. After a few weeks of the health diet, his mother could walk again.\par \par \uc2 But the tumor continued to grow. In the summer of 2014, the doctors said they could do no more for his mother, and Dario decided to take her to Mexico for an experimental treatment. He requested permission to leave, but when the \uc2 US government\uc2  asked for more information, he did not wait. He was desperate. The treatment failed. Weeks later she died in her parents' home in Mexico. In the eyes of the American government, Dario had self-deported. His first request to return was denied. School started, and Dario remained stuck in Mexico, despite efforts by Harvard's lawyers, the offices of Representative Michael Capuano and Senator Dick Durbin, and others. Finally, he agreed to let the Associated Press tell his story. Hours after it appeared, he was granted humanitarian parole. He would have to apply to get his DACA status reinstated and a new work visa, but he could return to the US and to school.\par \par \uc2 AFTER RETURNING TO HARVARD in January 2015, Dario became a copresident of the boxing club and began mentoring younger Latino students. His film was coming along \u8212\'20\'14 the story of his mother's decline, his experience in Mexico, his parents' history, all set against the Aztec creation myth. He turned in the first half as his senior thesis and received top honors. Now it was on to graduation.\par \par \uc2 A week or so before, Dario had heard about the experimental art project of a fellow student who had put the entire contents of his wallet in a school vending machine \u8212\'20\'14 an exploration of how commercialized human identity had become. Captivated and irritated at how much privilege it required to renounce the very documents he so desperately needed, Dario and some undocumented friends hijacked the art project. Using rolls of quarters, they bought the entire contents of the wallet, then put up a ransom note. They would return the items only if their classmate could verify his identity with transcripts, a birth certificate, a personal letter from his mother, enough social media posts to prove he'd been in the country for the last five years, and a mock immigration interview \u8212\'20\'14 a nod to the requirements they'd had to complete for the DACA program. The student gamely agreed. The prank ended with shared drinks and the return of the wallet.\par \par \uc2 After graduation, Dario had lined up an internship at the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C. He was still waiting for his DACA status to be reinstated, which he needed to finalize the internship, but at least the humanitarian parole would let him stay in the country.\par \par \uc2 DARIO SPENT LESS THAN TWO WEEKS in Washington. Without his DACA status reinstated, he wasn't eligible for the Dumbarton fellowship. On his last night before heading back to California, Dario decided to go see the monuments with a few friends. They took a cab from Georgetown to the Lincoln Memorial. They walked from there to the Korean War Veterans and World War II memorials. At the FDR Memorial they got caught in a crowd of Pokemon Go players. Finally, they sat down beneath the Jefferson Memorial rotunda.\par \par \uc2 Dario looked across the marble at the four inscriptions on the towering walls, settling on the fourth. \u8220\'20\'1CI am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times," Thomas Jefferson had written some 200 years before.\par \par \uc2 Dario spent the summer with his family, caring for his little sister Andrea, helping out his father, and wondering what he would do next as he watched his fellow graduates take new jobs and move forward with their lives.\par \par \uc2 In early September, the Trump administration \u8212\'20\'14 under threat of a lawsuit by Texas's attorney general over DACA \u8212\'20\'14 announced it would sunset the protection and would no longer accept new DACA applications. Those whose DACA permits expired before March could apply for one last extension that would protect them through 2019 \u8212\'20\'14 but only if they applied by October 5. Dario tried to distract himself. He finished the film about his mother and began looking for a premiere date. He started driving for Uber and boxing again, training for the Golden Gloves amateur competition.\par \par \uc2 Then, days before DACA was set to run out, Dario received a letter from DHS. His DACA status was reactivated, giving him two more years to live and work legally in the US. But for Dario and many like him, their long-term futures here remain a question mark.\par \par \uc2 Laura Wides-Munoz, vice president of special projects and editorial strategy at Fusion TV, previously reported on immigration, including Dario's story, at the Associated Press.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Dario Guerrero took his mom to Mexico when she was dying. It cost him his DACA status.\par \par \uc2 DARIO GUERRERO WAS FINISHING HIS HOMEWORK in the library at the California Academy of Mathematics and Science when his phone buzzed in late December 2010. Dario, like the children of most undocumented immigrants, had followed the DREAM Act vote in the Senate, but only barely. He'd been focused on school and sports and college applications.\par \par \uc2 Dario looked down, puzzled. It was a Boston area code. His heart began to race. He took the call and ran out to the front steps of the library.\par \par \uc2 An admissions officer from \uc2 Harvard University\uc2  broke the good news. Dario had won an undergraduate spot, with enough financial aid to cover tuition, room, and board. A letter confirming the admission was on its way. Dario's mouth hung open.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThank you. Thank you. Thank you!" Dario repeated. He couldn't think of anything else to say. He hung up the phone and jumped into the air, pumping his fist above him as he let out a whoop of joy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou did it. Mijo, you did it!" Dario Sr. cried that night. The DREAM Act, first proposed in 2001 as a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who had come to this country as children with their parents, had failed yet again to pass, this time by five votes. But surely now, his soon-to-be-college-student son was safe from deportation.\par \par \uc2 Dario hadn't even known he was undocumented for most of his life, until he discovered that the Social Security number he was using belonged to his younger brother, who was born in the United States. But by September 2011, Dario felt he was finally starting life, freed from that box of \u8220\'20\'1C\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ." From here on, his identity would be \u8220\'20\'1CHarvard student."\par \par \uc2 One night late in the fall of his freshman year, Dario hung out in the Harvard dorms with a few friends. One, the son of a banking executive, offered to take them all to a rave in the Netherlands on his father's private plane.\par \par \uc2 Sure, they all laughed, let's do it. Dario looked over at his roommate Alex, who was from South Carolina, and like Dario found the whole scene both awe-inspiring and ridiculous. Alex raised an eyebrow. Was this kid serious?\par \par \uc2 A couple of guys leaned forward, calculating the cost, joking about where they'd stashed their passports. Dario nodded along. Even on a free plane with room and board taken care of, there was no way on earth he'd be able to go. He had no passport. He couldn't leave the country, not if he wanted to ever get back in.\par \par \uc2 He scoffed. Raves were lame, he said.\par \par \uc2 Dario's girlfriend had gotten him to go to some Latino student events on campus. They even talked, mostly in jest, about getting married so he could adjust his status.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CDude, why are you getting married?" Alex yelled when he overheard the plan. \u8220\'20\'1CYou're 18!" That night, Dario told Alex about his immigration status.\par \par \uc2 At first, Alex didn't believe him. \u8220\'20\'1CI had no idea people who were undocumented could go to college, and to Harvard," Alex said later. Alex's own father was from Syria, a doctor who'd gotten a green card through a visa program for physicians willing to work in underserved communities. Alex's father spoke sympathetically about the plight of the undocumented, mostly farmworkers who were flocking to South Carolina looking for work. His mother, a US native, not so much. She wondered why they didn't just get in line and do it the right way.\par \par \uc2 Dario told Alex that since his father wasn't a doctor, nor did he have a million dollars to invest in a company, there wasn't really a \u8220\'20\'1Cright way to come." The line for most Mexicans was literally a lifetime long. His parents did pay taxes. Only, unlike Americans, they were unlikely to get back any of the money they put into the system when they retired.\par \par \uc2 Dario and his girlfriend broke up. He and Alex started hanging around more. Dario confided in Alex about a film he had started his senior year with other undocumented friends about applying for college without papers. Alex was fascinated. He offered to help. Together, they could make a full-length documentary. Maybe, said Dario. He'd wanted to come to Harvard precisely so he wouldn't have to think about what his immigration status meant anymore. He joined the boxing club. He partied alongside all the other first-years.\par \par \uc2 Many of his friends held odd jobs on campus or off to pay their way, or for spending money. Dario couldn't get a job \u8212\'20\'14 on the books, anyway.\par \par \uc2 Alex and Dario stayed up late drinking beer and mapping out ideas for a film following undocumented students at Harvard. Dario found nearly a dozen, including graduate students, mostly through word of mouth. But few wanted their faces on camera. They were scared of what it would mean for them, their families, and for Harvard were they to go public.\par \par \uc2 Their fears weren't unfounded. In the wake of the DREAM Act's failure, United We Dream, a youth-led immigrant activist organization, had documented more than 30 cases of DREAM Act-eligible students who had been detained and put in deportation hearings. By the fall of 2011, the Obama administration was on track to deport nearly 400,000 people annually, a record. Students continued to be among those rounded up. Immigrant leaders struggled to reconcile the president they had campaigned for with Obama's stepped-up deportation program. Stricter enforcement hadn't brought Congress any closer to taking action on the DREAMers, and even if it had, it would not have stopped their siblings and parents from being deported.\par \par \uc2 As the action shifted back to the states with Congress gridlocked, young immigrant activists were loud and unapologetic. In many ways, the failure of the DREAM Act had freed them from the image Congress seemed to demand of them. Presenting the story of the perfect, well-mannered student hadn't worked. Now they could just be human.\par \par \uc2 The young activists would make national headlines confronting politicians, including GOP presidential candidate \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  at a fund-raiser in New York City, where a Peruvian native, Lucia Allain, asked Romney about his dislike of the DREAM Act on camera. It went viral. These activists could get away with the confrontations precisely because, unlike their parents, they had no accents, and could often blend into a crowd of political supporters.\par \par \uc2 In late January 2012, a few days before Florida's GOP presidential primary, the state's freshman US senator, Marco Rubio, addressed the Republican-backed Hispanic Leadership Network in Miami in his first major speech on immigration, arguing a national consensus existed in favor of helping out young DREAMers. \u8220\'20\'1CThere is broad bipartisan support for the notion that we should figure out a way to accommodate them," Rubio said.\par \par \uc2 THE MORNING OF JUNE 15, 2012, the president strode out onto the steps of the White House and into the Rose Garden, where he unveiled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the most dramatic immigration reform the United States had seen in nearly three decades. Young people who came to the United States before the age of 16; were currently 30 or younger; had been physically present in the country for the past five years; and were in school, had graduated from high school, or had joined the military would be eligible to work and in many states to drive. They would no longer have to fear that any interaction with police could lead to deportation. \u8220\'20\'1CIt makes no sense to expel talented young people who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans," the president said.\par \par \uc2 It was estimated that more than 1 million people would be affected by the order (the number to date is closer to 800,000).\par \par \uc2 In Long Beach, Dario's mother shrieked from the living room and ran to wake her son, home from college and sleeping late. Dario sat up. His first thought: \u8220\'20\'1CThank God I didn't get married." His mind flashed to all the things he wanted to do: Get a driver's license, find a job to help his parents, and maybe study abroad.\par \par \uc2 In Los Angeles, during a protest in front of the downtown immigrant detention facility, dozens of youth stopped chanting and waving their signs and stood in a circle holding hands, savoring for just a few quiet minutes the unexpected victory.\par \par \uc2 LIFE IN CAMBRIDGE changed for Dario after DACA. He landed a position at a campus-affiliated bar, then a job at the massive Widener Library's audiovisual department. He began to enjoy more of the privileges of school. Armed with DACA, undocumented students on campus became more willing to talk for his film project.\par \par \uc2 Then in the late fall of his junior year, his father called. His mother was sick. It was most likely cancer. In January 2014, Dario took a leave of absence from Harvard.\par \par \uc2 He began using his university-level research skills to find alternative cures. He tore up the family's traditional menu of carne, rice, and veggies. He invested in an industrial-strength juicer, filming its first use for a project about his mom, as orange carrot juice went flying in his hair.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe first to vomit loses!" they joked after Dario whipped up his first cleanser, and mother and son clinked their glasses. After a few weeks of the health diet, his mother could walk again.\par \par \uc2 But the tumor continued to grow. In the summer of 2014, the doctors said they could do no more for his mother, and Dario decided to take her to Mexico for an experimental treatment. He requested permission to leave, but when the \uc2 US government\uc2  asked for more information, he did not wait. He was desperate. The treatment failed. Weeks later she died in her parents' home in Mexico. In the eyes of the American government, Dario had self-deported. His first request to return was denied. School started, and Dario remained stuck in Mexico, despite efforts by Harvard's lawyers, the offices of Representative Michael Capuano and Senator Dick Durbin, and others. Finally, he agreed to let the Associated Press tell his story. Hours after it appeared, he was granted humanitarian parole. He would have to apply to get his DACA status reinstated and a new work visa, but he could return to the US and to school.\par \par \uc2 AFTER RETURNING TO HARVARD in January 2015, Dario became a copresident of the boxing club and began mentoring younger Latino students. His film was coming along \u8212\'20\'14 the story of his mother's decline, his experience in Mexico, his parents' history, all set against the Aztec creation myth. He turned in the first half as his senior thesis and received top honors. Now it was on to graduation.\par \par \uc2 A week or so before, Dario had heard about the experimental art project of a fellow student who had put the entire contents of his wallet in a school vending machine \u8212\'20\'14 an exploration of how commercialized human identity had become. Captivated and irritated at how much privilege it required to renounce the very documents he so desperately needed, Dario and some undocumented friends hijacked the art project. Using rolls of quarters, they bought the entire contents of the wallet, then put up a ransom note. They would return the items only if their classmate could verify his identity with transcripts, a birth certificate, a personal letter from his mother, enough social media posts to prove he'd been in the country for the last five years, and a mock immigration interview \u8212\'20\'14 a nod to the requirements they'd had to complete for the DACA program. The student gamely agreed. The prank ended with shared drinks and the return of the wallet.\par \par \uc2 After graduation, Dario had lined up an internship at the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C. He was still waiting for his DACA status to be reinstated, which he needed to finalize the internship, but at least the humanitarian parole would let him stay in the country.\par \par \uc2 DARIO SPENT LESS THAN TWO WEEKS in Washington. Without his DACA status reinstated, he wasn't eligible for the Dumbarton fellowship. On his last night before heading back to California, Dario decided to go see the monuments with a few friends. They took a cab from Georgetown to the Lincoln Memorial. They walked from there to the Korean War Veterans and World War II memorials. At the FDR Memorial they got caught in a crowd of Pokemon Go players. Finally, they sat down beneath the Jefferson Memorial rotunda.\par \par \uc2 Dario looked across the marble at the four inscriptions on the towering walls, settling on the fourth. \u8220\'20\'1CI am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times," Thomas Jefferson had written some 200 years before.\par \par \uc2 Dario spent the summer with his family, caring for his little sister Andrea, helping out his father, and wondering what he would do next as he watched his fellow graduates take new jobs and move forward with their lives.\par \par \uc2 In early September, the Trump administration \u8212\'20\'14 under threat of a lawsuit by Texas's attorney general over DACA \u8212\'20\'14 announced it would sunset the protection and would no longer accept new DACA applications. Those whose DACA permits expired before March could apply for one last extension that would protect them through 2019 \u8212\'20\'14 but only if they applied by October 5. Dario tried to distract himself. He finished the film about his mother and began looking for a premiere date. He started driving for Uber and boxing again, training for the Golden Gloves amateur competition.\par \par \uc2 Then, days before DACA was set to run out, Dario received a letter from DHS. His DACA status was reactivated, giving him two more years to live and work legally in the US. But for Dario and many like him, their long-term futures here remain a question mark.\par \par \uc2 Laura Wides-Munoz, vice president of special projects and editorial strategy at Fusion TV, previously reported on immigration, including Dario's story, at the Associated Press.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The so-called \u8220\'20\'1CSafe Communities Act" legislation in no way keeps the people of Massachusetts safer.\par \par \uc2 The bill would prohibit the use of state tax dollars for \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  and largely prohibit any state agency from working with ICE officials. The legislation would make Massachusetts a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants. Both the financial and public safety costs would be enormous.\par \par \uc2 Massachusetts spends significant sums annually on Medicaid claims for immigrants who cannot prove their legal status \u8212\'20\'14 the state calculated the cost at $93 million in fiscal 2011. The Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization that supports reduced immigration, estimates that there are 225,000 illegal immigrants presently in our state, and that 25 percent of them receive welfare benefits. If Massachusetts were to become a sanctuary state, it would also become a magnet state; thus, the number of illegal immigrants would significantly increase.\par \par \uc2 On the public safety front, no one should ever forget the tragic loss of Matthew Denice. The 23-year-old Milford man was killed while riding on a motorcycle in 2011 when he was struck by a drunk-driving \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who dragged him to his death after Denice became entangled beneath his truck. Witnesses could hear Matthew begging for his life and yelling for the driver to stop.\par \par \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2  was fatally shot in 2015 by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had been deported five times but released from jail in the sanctuary city of San Francisco. Although \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2  admitted to shooting Steinle, a jury acquitted him of murder and manslaughter. He was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and now faces federal gun and immigration charges.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in the case of Sreynoun Lunn that our court officers do not have authority to detain any person solely at the request of ICE. Several months after that ruling, Lunn was arrested for allegedly attacking a wheelchair-bound woman in broad daylight to steal $2,000.\par \par \uc2 The first obligation of government is to keep our citizens safe. This bill would protect criminal illegal immigrants, not our legal residents. Moreover, it would be financially devastating to our state budget.\par \par \uc2 As told to Globe correspondent John Laidler.

Many are harmless. But some are ruthless. Who are they exactly, and why do they do what they do?\b0\par\par\uc2 NEIL SWIDEY \par \uc2 4,444 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 January 2018\par \uc2 The Boston Globe\par \uc2 BSTNGB\par R.16\par \uc2 ISSN:07431791\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2018 The Boston Globe. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On Monday, May 17, at 2 p.m., a breaking news article headlined "Obama's aunt given OK to stay in United States" hits the home page of Boston.com. In a matter of seconds, the first anonymous online comment appears. A reader with the handle of Peregrinite writes, "of course she can . . . can someone appeal."\par \par \uc2 Certain topics never fail to generate a flood of impassioned reactions online: immigration, President Obama, federal taxes, "birthers," and race. This story about Obama's Kenyan aunt, who had been exposed as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  living in public housing in Boston and who was now seeking asylum, manages to pull strands from all five of those contentious subjects.\par \par \uc2 In the next few minutes, several equally innocuous posts follow, including a rare comment in favor of the judge's decision. Then the name-calling begins. At 2:03 p.m., a commenter with the pseudonym of Craptulous calls the aunt, Zeituni Onyango, a "foreign free-loader." Seconds later comes the lament from Redzone 300: "Just another reason to hate are [sic] corrupt government."\par \par \uc2 News websites from across the country struggle to maintain civility in their online comments forums. But given their anonymous nature and anything-goes ethos, these forums can sometimes feel as ungovernable as the tribal lands of Pakistan.\par \par \uc2 At Boston.com, the website of The \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2 , a team of moderators - or "mods" - monitor the comments. Actually, with just one or two mods on per shift, and an average of more than 6,000 comments posted every day, on every corner of the site, the mods could never hope to monitor all the simultaneous chatter. Instead, they focus on evaluating the "abuse reports" that commenters file against one another. For Steve Morgan, a veteran editor who coordinates the monitoring, the color of trouble is red. The crimson message at the top of his computer screen keeps a running total of the abuse reports that are awaiting action. Some complaints don't ultimately turn up abuse - coarse language, ad hominem attacks, and the like - but rather just a political stance that the person doing the complaining doesn't care for. So a mod needs to evaluate each complaint and decide either to remove the comment or let it stand.\par \par \uc2 Over the next two hours, the comments about Obama's aunt keep flying, the abuse reports continue to climb, and the mods scramble to remove the many posts - both conservative and liberal - that they determine have crossed the line. Some comments are enlightening, on both sides of the issue. (Madriver1 offers statistics showing that, of nearly 40,000 asylum requests filed last year, more than one-quarter were granted.) Some are unintentionally funny. (GLOBEREADER83 chastises another commenter for having written "good grammar" instead of "proper grammar," but in both cases misspells it as grammer.) And many are not just mean, but make-you-want-to-shower nasty. There are references to Muslim bombers, Somalian pirates, "teabaggers and xenophobes," America becoming "a 3rd world socialist hellhole," and crude comparisons between Aunt Zeituni and James Brown, and between the first family and farm animals.\par \par \uc2 At 3:41 p.m., when the commentary has degenerated into all-out combat, hummlarry writes, "Obama is Kenyan and he is illegal and president. We have been invaded by non-americans and the liberals are to blame. I hope that one of the liberals feels the pain by being broken into by a needy illegal and then maybe they will get it. Deport them all."\par \par \uc2 Not long after that, Boston.com staffers take the drastic and relatively rare step of turning off the comments function on that particular article. (For certain types of stories, such as those involving personal tragedies, the comments section is turned off from the start.) Poof - hundreds of comments about Obama's aunt disappear.\par \par \uc2 Too many abuse reports had been pouring in; by day's end, the total number would be 1,330 - twice the daily average for the previous month. More than that, the commentary had reached its tipping point. The pros of hosting a robust, freewheeling conversation had become outweighed by the cons of all the venom and nastiness, by people who are allowed to name-call without any obligation to reveal their own names.\par \par \uc2 >The raging commentary on Obama's aunt is a microcosm of the thorny problem many websites are grappling with right now over what to do with anonymous comments. At many of these sites, executives have begun to ask themselves: How did we get into this thicket, and is there a sensible way out? But a more basic question needs to be answered first: Who are these people who spend so much of their days posting anonymous comments, and what is motivating them?\par \par \uc2 Newspapers find themselves in a strange position. People wanting to have a letter to the editor printed in the paper have long been required to provide their name, address, and a daytime phone number. Yet on the websites owned by these same newspapers, all it usually takes to be handed a perpetual soapbox is an active e-mail address.\par \par \uc2 After years of letting anonymity rule online, many media heavyweights, from The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  to The Huffington Post, have begun to modify their policies. The goal is to take the playground back from anonymous bullies and give greater weight to those willing to offer, in addition to strong views, their real names.\par \par \uc2 Others, like The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, are probably wishing they'd taken that step earlier. In March, the paper outed a local judge for allegedly posting comments on Cleveland.com under the handle lawmiss that included critical commentary on cases and individuals appearing before her in court. The judge denied authorship and is now suing the paper and its affiliated companies for $50 million. Her denials might seem a smidge south of persuasive, and The Plain Dealer may well have been journalistically suspect had it not gone public with the information once it discovered it. But the judge has a valid point about her expectations of anonymity.\par \par \uc2 In another suit, a Louisiana public official sued 11 anonymous posters last month for comments on The Times-Picayune website that he said were malicious and untruthful. (He didn't sue the website - under federal law, sites are generally not legally responsible for defamatory postings by readers - but rather asked that it disclose the commenters' names. He later dropped the suit.) No matter who you believe in each of these cases, it's a haunted house that anonymity built.\par \par \uc2 Anonymous commentary is a push and pull between privacy and trust, and the implications extend beyond news sites to include Web reviews for everything from books to technology to hotel rooms. Online postings can sway political opinion and heavily influence whether products or businesses thrive or fail. They can make or break reputations and livelihoods. On one side, anonymous comments give users the freedom to be completely candid in a public forum. On the other, that freedom can be abused and manipulated to spread lies or mask hidden agendas. With all that in the balance, the thinking goes, shouldn't we know who's saying these things?\par \par \uc2 Clearly, anonymity is under attack. Even the Chinese government has had enough, announcing last month it would begin a push to end unnamed online comments. And, really, there's not much that officials in Beijing don't already know about who's saying what within their borders.\par \par \uc2 Still, the nameless nature of the Web is so embedded in the culture that it will be hard to change the rules now. And as newspaper websites struggle to maintain their central role hosting the community conversation and work to increase the time users spend on their sites, scrapping anonymity isn't such a clear-cut call.\par \par \uc2 I've always loved finding the hidden gems in online comments - the surprising slice of data that makes me question one of my political assumptions, the pithy one-liner that makes me laugh out loud. But those gems seem increasingly rare amid all the yelling and hollow rage and predictable talking points.\par \par \uc2 If we hope to clean up the online conversation, we need a better understanding of the select group of people doing most of the talking. Studies have shown that participation rates in online social communities tend to follow something called the "90-9-1" rule. About 90 percent of the people are "lurkers," that is, watching but not actively contributing; 9 percent are infrequent contributors; and 1 percent are, to borrow a term from the fast-food industry, the heavy users.\par \par \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  and \uc2 Burger King\uc2  have teams of researchers who do nothing but try to understand the patterns, desires, and quirks of their heavy users, their best customers. However, yet another unfortunate byproduct of anonymity is that news sites know precious little about their most active commenters.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 STANLEY TALABACH IS A MAN OF ROUTINE. He wakes up at 5 every morning and by 6 has made his way down to the dark kitchen of his North Attleborough town house. He consumes a breakfast consisting of a cocktail of Mountain Dew and orange juice, a multivitamin, 25 milligrams of diuretic (for mild hypertension), an adult dose of baby aspirin, folic acid, and a banana.\par \par \uc2 He then logs on to the desktop computer that functions as the centerpiece of his kitchen table, and goes to three different sites - Boston.com, BostonHerald.com, and MSN.com - to check his horoscope. That the three seldom agree on how a Pisces like him will fare that day has done little to dampen his enthusiasm for the astral arts. If the Boston.com horoscope offers five stars, it puts an extra spring in his step.\par \par \uc2 Talabach knows housekeeping is not one of his strengths, but as a twice-divorced, semi-retired 66-year-old credit analyst who lives alone, he doesn't feel the need to impress anyone. He assures me the walls and the blinds on the kitchen slider were once white, but I see no evidence of their ever having been anything other than a brownish yellow. "That's thanks to these," he says, holding up a pack of Berkley unfiltered cigarettes. Next to his computer he keeps a blue ashtray that is more like a small urn.\par \par \uc2 After the horoscopes, Talabach turns to the articles posted on Boston.com and makes his daily transformation, from Stanley to Xenophonic.\par \par \uc2 Let's clear this up right now: It's not Xenophobic, but Xenophonic, a common mistake, especially by those reading his comments on immigration, one of his favorite topics. Although he is an unenrolled voter, he is a proud conservative, and there are few issues that get him more worked up than illegal immigration. A couple come close: unions, affirmative action, and anything having to do with Ted Kennedy.\par \par \uc2 "I don't care where you came from to come here ILLEGALLY, GO BACK!" he wrote last month in a comment attached to an article about Governor Deval Patrick blasting Arizona's new immigration law. "Did we all see where some wise guy students in California took down the American flag, hoisted the MEXICAN flag and put the American flag beneath it . . . UPSIDE DOWN? Ahnold should have sent in the National Guard to remove the Mexican Flag and rehoist the American flag."\par \par \uc2 Although some liberal commenters accuse him of being xenophobic, Talabach says he has no quarrel with outsiders. His father emigrated from Albania, a detail of his biography he often invokes in his posts on immigration, as he did in the closing to his comment about the Mexican flag: "FYI son of an immigrant that came here LEGALLY."\par \par \uc2 His political views have been shaped unmistakably by his life experience. Knowing that his father followed the rules to come to the States, worked hard every day of his life, and served eight years in the \uc2 US Army\uc2 , Talabach is offended when he perceives new immigrants looking for shortcuts. Recalling that he himself made $1.90 an hour at his first job, but he got to take home 85 percent of his pay, Talabach is on guard against any sniff of wasteful spending by a federal and state government that combine to "relieve me of 26, 27, 28 percent of my pay." Feeling he was passed over for promotions during the 1970s and '80s in favor of female and minority candidates he saw as less qualified, he loathes "first" articles, like those touting the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. "Why do we need to keep score?" he'll thunder.\par \par \uc2 He posts most of his comments in the morning, before heading to work in Mansfield. Ever since he decided to semi-retire about three years ago, his schedule has been 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., though he usually shows up at work at 7:10 a.m., taking the extra time to read the paper. He's been at his current job for 11 years and says that for at least nine of them, he never missed a single day of work.\par \par \uc2 Other than the occasional conversation with his boss, almost all of his political discussions take place in the form of online comments.\par \par \uc2 When he gets home, he'll look to see how other commenters have responded to his earlier posts. There's a "Recommend" button on the comments page on Boston.com, where people can give their thumbs up to posted comments. This is the metric by which Talabach judges his daily performance. He recalls the time his comment on a column titled "My Lazy American Students" drew hundreds of "Recommends." Leaning back in his chair, with his left arm resting on his thick belly and his right arm jingling change in his pocket, he smiles. "There were more than 600 comments, and at least half of them agreed with me!"\par \par \uc2 I ask him if he has any hobbies. He points to a large wall hanging behind him. "I made this rug," he says, before adding, "I made those two clocks," and pointing to a pair nearby. "They came in a kit." I ask him if he has a workshop in the house. He shakes his head. "No, I made all of these things when I was living at my old house in Foxborough." Then it dawns on me. He told me earlier that he'd been living in his current place for more than a decade. So much for current hobbies.\par \par \uc2 He has no wife, no children, and a job requiring just 20 hours a week. He doesn't follow sports, doesn't hang out at bars or go on many trips beyond the occasional visit to play the slots at Twin River, and isn't involved in any organizations to speak of. But he is extremely active in his community. It just happens to be one that only exists online.\par \par \uc2 Despite his strong views, he is generally a responsible member of that community. Every once in a while he'll find one of his comments on Boston.com has been removed because he went too far. (It's a safe bet it involved Teddy K.) Occasionally, he'll commit the common commenter sin of weighing in on an article without having read it, and be called on it when his objection turns out to have been covered in the fifth paragraph.\par \par \uc2 But, overall, he plays by the rules, works hard at this commenter job of his, and, in a way, serves his community. After reading his posts and spending time with him, I believe him when he tells me that, even though he's anonymous online, he would never write anything that he wouldn't say "mano a mano." That, incidentally, strikes me as a pretty good standard for separating the stand-up commenters from the cowardly name-callers.\par \par \uc2 One more thing about this anonymous heavy user named Xenophonic. He's never been all that anonymous. The full name his parents gave him at his christening is the same one his father was given back in Albania: Xenophon Stanley Talabach.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 I REACHED OUT TO DOZENS of Boston.com heavy users like Xenophonic. Actually, to protect the privacy of users, I wasn't handed their e-mail addresses. Instead, I gave a list of the commenters with whom I wanted to speak to Boston.com's director of user engagement, Teresa Hanafin, who then e-mailed the commenters directly, telling them they could contact me if they wanted to be interviewed. (I chose to focus on Boston.com users for obvious reasons: It's got the biggest regional reach and it's where I could hope to get the most complete picture of online users.) My list included a wide range of posters: conservatives and liberals, people who comment on articles and people who spend their time on the themed message boards, the reasonable types and the all-caps troublemakers. I made it clear that I wouldn't reveal anyone's identity without their permission.\par \par \uc2 Those willing to talk included people on the left and the right, males and females, people passionate about sports and people passionate about politics and people passionate about passion (the Love Letters crowd). Somewhat surprisingly, many had no problem with my using their real names in the article, though a few offered some understandable reasons why they didn't want to be identified.\par \par \uc2 But here's whom I didn't hear back from: the screamers, troublemakers, and trolls (Internet slang for people behind inflammatory posts). Not a single one. The loudest, most aggressive voices grew mum when asked to explain themselves, to engage in an actual discussion. The trolls appear to prize their anonymity more than anyone else.\par \par \uc2 Michael Sol Pollens is not a troll, but he is a heavy user. He explains that he spent three decades as a private detective, focusing mostly on fraud investigations, before suffering a nervous breakdown. He turned in his detective's license and began writing detective fiction. He quickly discovered that posting comments online could be a therapeutic way to kick off his early-morning writing schedule. "I get up at 4, fire up a little incense, fire up some rock music, and go at it," says the 51-year-old.\par \par \uc2 Pollens posts on Boston.com, NYTimes.com, and elsewhere under the same pen name he uses for his fiction, KurtLarsen. When he worked as a PI, Pollens was careful not to have his photo taken, but he's more relaxed about identity these days. (He recently got his detective's license back.) When I interviewed him in the lilac study of the Malden home he shares with his wife, he had no hesitation about also being videotaped. Curiously, his only request was that he be allowed to wear his shades. He includes a link to his website, KurtLarsen.net, in his posts, and that website includes a reference to his real name.\par \par \uc2 Pollens, who peppers his sentences with a sometimes exhausting series of literary references, comments most frequently on stories about post-9/11 civil rights infringements and the Arab-Israeli conflict. (He is Jewish but is a tough critic of the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians.) At his most productive, he posts up to four comments a day. He is every bit as liberal as Xenophonic is conservative, but the appeal for his participation is similar, and he is equally focused on his "Recommends" standing. "I do enjoy the community nature of this," he says.\par \par \uc2 That community can morph in fascinating ways. In the comments section on articles about Arab-Israeli relations, Pollens found a poster named Shamu who was preaching from the same pulpit. "I like what you say," Pollens wrote Shamu at one point, inviting Shamu to contact him offline. Shamu did. They've since become friends and have had dinner together several times.\par \par \uc2 Shamu, it turns out, is a therapist from the North Shore. Out of sensitivity to his clients, he tries to keep his political views private and asked me not to include his real name. He says that months of reading KurtLarsen posts had given him such insight into Pollens that by the time they met, there were few surprises. "I am amazed by how well you can know somebody through the Internet," Shamu says. "When you actually meet, you're just adding a face and body inflections."\par \par \uc2 Then again, sometimes those impressions formed online can turn out to be off base. Yoshimi25 is one of the most faithful contributors to On the Front Burner, a \uc2 Red Sox\uc2  discussion board on Boston.com. On game nights, she'll spend five hours or more on the board - posting comments before, during, and after the game.\par \par \uc2 Yoshimi25 hasn't lived in the Boston area for nearly two decades. Still, her heart beats for Boston. I met her and her 18-year-old daughter when they returned to the area from Ohio for a recent vacation. Both were wearing \uc2 Red Sox\uc2  championship T-shirts.\par \par \uc2 When I ask Yoshimi25 her age, she says, "Forty-three - exactly two months younger than Tim Wakefield." A divorced freelance artist who uses finger quotes when referring to her "social life," Yoshimi25 says, "I don't have many close friends in Ohio." Her friends on Boston.com fill that void. She feels she's gotten to know quite a bit about her fellow heavy users. "I know LloydDobler has two kids, and they must be young, because he talks about putting them to bed at 8 o'clock," she says. "I know jesseyeric is in a local band."\par \par \uc2 Once when a troll attacked Yoshimi25, hurling ugly anti-Asian slurs at her, her friends on the boards rose to her defense. Most people assume Yoshimi25 is Asian. In fact, she is a blue-eyed Irish-American named Kelly. (She asked me not to use her last name, but agreed to be photographed for this article.) Her Eastern-sounding handle comes from her days practicing martial arts. Yoshimi25 says that because the Front Burner message board is such an intimate group, the regulars on it tend to behave well, even though they're anonymous. "Although I can say anything I want without consequences," she says, "you should behave as though there are consequences."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 THAT GETS TO THE HEART of the problem. The comments sections on many general-interest news sites lack both the carrot and the stick for encouraging responsible behavior. The carrot is the cohesion of a group you don't want to disappoint, like Yoshimi25's Front Burner community. The stick is the shame associated with having your real name publicly attached to embarrassing behavior. Without these two levers, the social contract breaks down.\par \par \uc2 Steve Yelvington knows this terrain as well as anyone. In the mid-1980s, he began hosting dial-up bulletin boards as a hobby. Most of the people on them used pseudonyms, but because it was a coherent group, the social contract remained strong. In 1994, he was the founding editor of the Star Tribune Online in Minneapolis (now Startribune.com), which Minnesota's largest newspaper began as a pre-Web platform that required participants to provide not only their real names but also a credit card number. Yet with the arrival of the Web and the proliferation of online forums, anonymity began to take hold, fueled, in particular, by the way the early dominant service provider, American Online, gave each account the option for multiple screen names.\par \par \uc2 "As the conversational spaces get larger," Yelvington says, "the bonds that tie people together get weaker."\par \par \uc2 The 57-year-old Yelvington is now a new-media strategist working with \uc2 Morris Publishing Group\uc2 , whose holdings include 13 daily papers from Florida to Alaska. His goal is to clean up the playground of online comments while preserving some measure of anonymity, so that, say, a closeted gay student would still feel comfortable posting a comment about the climate at his high school. To strike this balance, Yelvington is pushing Morris sites to insist on collecting (but not publishing) real names and street addresses for everyone who comments, yet allow users to continue to post under pseudonyms. "That gives us a reasonably powerful tool for detecting troublemakers," he says. "Most of the troublemakers tend to lie about their name and address, but they lie poorly.\par \par \uc2 Still, that approach would have done nothing to prevent the mess that the The Plain Dealer found itself in with the judge and lawmiss's comments. To avoid minefields like that, Howard Owens, a former digital executive at \uc2 Gatehouse Media\uc2 , insists on real names for anyone posting on TheBatavian.com, the news site he publishes in Batavia, New York.\par \par \uc2 Under Yelvington's plan, Owens says, readers wouldn't know if the JIMY23 posting a comment blasting the mayor is really the guy planning to challenge him in the next election. And if the managers of the news site figure that out, it puts them in an awful bind.\par \par \uc2 Owens insists that a no-anonymity rule is not just good journalism but good business as well. "My competitor allows anonymous comments," he says. "We don't. We get 10 times what they get. My users are more willing to engage in conversation, because they know who they are arguing with." Almost all the heavy users I spoke with said they would continue to comment even if they had to provide their real name.\par \par \uc2 While news organizations debate scrapping anonymity, the ground may be shifting beneath them. With all of our identifying information getting sliced, diced, and sold, by everyone from credit card companies to \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , is there really such a thing as the anonymous Web anymore? Consider this demonstration from the late '90s by Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor Latanya Sweeney. She took three commonly available data points: sex (male), ZIP code (02138), and date of birth (July 31, 1945). Those seemingly anonymous attributes could have described lots of people, right? Actually, no. She proved they could belong to just one person: former governor William Weld. She tells me that 87 percent of Americans can now be identified with just these three data points.\par \par \uc2 Maybe the best approach to getting people to behave better online is just reminding them how easy it is to figure out who they really are.\par \par \uc2 Neil Swidey is a Globe Magazine staff writer.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 YES\par \par \uc2 Marcia Szymanski\par \par \uc2 President/chief executive, New Hope, a domestic violence agency that serves 41 cities and towns in Southeastern Massachusetts\par \par \uc2 While most of us celebrated the New Year with friends and family, some Massachusetts residents were just trying to remain safe from domestic violence. For immigrant survivors especially, seeking help is fraught with difficulty.\par \par \uc2 Recently a local agency called me trying to help one such woman. She had fled with her young child and was now homeless. Normally I would suggest getting a restraining order so she could safely return home. But this woman is undocumented. She fears losing custody of her child -- a US citizen -- through deportation, complicating our ability to ensure her safety.\par \par \uc2 As CEO of New Hope, an agency that works with survivors of sexual and domestic violence throughout Southeastern Massachusetts -- including in Foxborough, Lakeville, Mansfield, Norton, Raynham, and Sharon -- I see far too many of these cases. Fear of separation from family members has always been a concern. But with the federal government encouraging ever-more police involvement in immigration matters, these concerns are sharper than ever. New Hope and our partner Jane Doe Inc., the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, strongly support the Safe Communities Act.\par \par \uc2 The legislation draws a clear line between law enforcement and immigration enforcement, allowing police to focus on public safety. Passage will strengthen bonds between police and immigrants in our communities, and encourage witnesses and victims to report crimes and assist police investigations -- particularly important for survivors of domestic and sexual violence.\par \par \uc2 By making it clear that in Massachusetts, police are focused on protecting public safety, this legislation would encourage immigrant survivors to get the help they need. We've seen firsthand how hard our local police work to protect survivors and their children. They know the current climate of fear hurts their ability to keep these families safe. This is why Massachusetts law enforcement leaders support creating clear guidelines for interacting with federal immigration enforcement agencies.\par \par \uc2 I see this bill as a life-saver. I hope you will join me in urging our legislators to pass the Safe Communities Act, and keep our police focused on what they do best: serving and protecting the public.\par \par \uc2 NO\par \par \uc2 Shaunna L. O'Connell\par \par \uc2 State representative, Taunton Republican whose district includes parts of Easton and Taunton\par \par \uc2 The so-called \u8220\'20\'1CSafe Communities Act" legislation in no way keeps the people of Massachusetts safer.\par \par \uc2 The bill would prohibit the use of state tax dollars for \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , and largely prohibit any state agency from working with ICE officials. The legislation would make Massachusetts a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants. Both the financial and public safety costs would be enormous.\par \par \uc2 Massachusetts spends significant sums annually on Medicaid claims for immigrants who could not prove their legal status -- the state calculated the cost at $93 million in fiscal 2011.\par \par \uc2 The Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization that supports reduced immigration, estimates there are 225,000 illegal immigrants presently in our state and that 25 percent receive welfare benefits. If Massachusetts was to become a sanctuary state, we would also be a magnet state; thus, the number of illegal immigrants would significantly increase.\par \par \uc2 On the public safety front, no one should ever forget the tragic loss of Matthew Denice. The 23-year-old Milford motorcyclist was killed in 2011 by a drunk-driving \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who dragged him to his death after Denice became entangled beneath his truck following a collision. Witnesses could hear Matthew begging for his life and for the driver to stop.\par \par \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2  was fatally shot in 2015 by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had been deported five times but released from jail in the sanctuary city of San Francisco. Although \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2  admitted to shooting Steinle, a jury acquitted him of murder and manslaughter. He was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and now faces federal gun and immigration charges.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in the case of Sreynoun Lunn that our court officers do not have authority to detain any person solely at the request of ICE. Several months after that ruling, Lunn was arrested for allegedly attacking a wheelchair-bound woman in broad daylight to steal $2,000.\par \par \uc2 The first obligation of government is to keep our citizens safe. This bill would protect criminal illegal immigrants, not our legal residents. Moreover, it would be financially devastating to our state budget.\par \par \uc2 (This is an informal poll, not a scientific survey. Please vote only once.)\par \par \uc2 As told to Globe correspondent John Laidler. He can be reached at laidler@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Caption:\par \par \uc2 Shaunna L.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 He's been foiled in D.C., but Trump's crackdown on immigrants has had seismic effects\par \par \uc2 YORK, Pa. \u8212\'20\'14 The crying starts when Anayeli Cruz talks about the new troubles in her life, the impact on her US-born children, about the changes in the country she has called home for 12 years.\par \par \uc2 When the sobs come, as they often do, her 2-year-old daughter climbs into her lap and tries to wipe away the tears.\par \par \uc2 Cruz attempts a smile, but her round, bubbly face crumples again as she describes details of her daily struggles: Fearful of who might call authorities and report her as an undocumented immigrant, she forbade her kids from trick-or-treating for Halloween. She tells the children they must play on the backyard swing set instead of at the public playground. She denied her son a birthday party because, as she put it, \u8220\'20\'1CYou never know what can happen."\par \par \uc2 It appears almost irrational from the outside, but the 28-year-old Mexican immigrant's fear is undeniable. She is afraid of certain neighbors. She is afraid to leave her home. She is afraid, above all, of President Trump and his immigration crackdown.\par \par \uc2 The paralyzing dread of deportation that Cruz feels is multiplied by the thousands here in York \u8212\'20\'14 a community that, because of its regional immigration court, is one of the largest hubs of detentions and deportations in Pennsylvania. That same apprehension is multiplied by the millions around the country.\par \par \uc2 Unlike his predecessor, who focused deportations on immigrants with a criminal history, Trump wants undocumented people of all kinds to be found, detained, and sent back to their home countries even if they have not committed a felony in the United States. He signed an executive order putting the new policy into effect just days after his inauguration, fulfilling a central campaign promise.\par \par \uc2 Now just being in the United States without government permission is grounds for being targeted by federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 This shift toward harsher treatment of immigrants has been one of the most tangible, and disruptive, actions of Trump's first year in office. Along with rising numbers of deportations, the accompanying worry and uncertainty in immigrant neighborhoods is its most tangible byproduct.\par \par \uc2 It's hard to plan for a future, after all, when that future can at any moment take the form of an immigration agent at your doorstep.\par \par \uc2 In York, the sense of vulnerability among immigrants is magnified by the community's small size. Most live in a tight cluster of wood-framed homes downtown; unlike big cities, the close quarters leave virtually nowhere to hide, particularly as York has not declared itself a \u8220\'20\'1Csanctuary city." The anxiety ripples from the strip malls on the outskirts of town to the apple orchards and dairy farms on the country roads, from the stoops on Queen Street downtown to the leafy college campus where undocumented immigrants once thought they had found refuge.\par \par \uc2 The county's immigration court \u8212\'20\'14 which sits next to the county prison where many immigrants awaiting hearings are held \u8212\'20\'14 is now one of the busiest in the country for processing deportations. It has ordered 1,546 deportations this year, which is up almost 40 percent over last year and almost as many as far larger cities such as Boston, Baltimore, and Las Vegas. The handful of immigration lawyers here are flooded with cases.\par \par \uc2 Sneaking into the United States, or overstaying your official welcome, has always carried risks, of course. But the hazards are much graver now.\par \par \uc2 Trump's promised crackdowns, and his pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border, are a big part of what got him elected. He promised as a candidate to deport by the millions, just like \uc2 Dwight Eisenhower\uc2 's \u8220\'20\'1COperation Wetback" campaign starting in 1954, which rounded up Mexicans in wholesale fashion. In office, Trump's early moves toward that model have been cheered by those who see illegal immigration as an intrusion on American life, undermining the integrity of the US economy.\par \par \uc2 But many of the people targeted for enforcement by Trump have been in the United States for years, even a decade or more, waiting for Washington to decide if they could win a path to legal status or even citizenship. That possibility now seems more remote than ever.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants report being afraid to drive or even come out of their homes. Some are preparing to give up custody of their US-born minor children, in the event they are picked up by immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll these people who have anything less than citizenship are now rattled," said Elizabeth Alex, a senior director of organizing and leadership at CASA, an immigrant rights group. \u8220\'20\'1CThe onion is peeling layer by layer and the whole community is realizing: None of us is safe anymore."\par \par \uc2 Cruz crossed the border illegally from Mexico into Arizona about 12 years ago, when she was a teenager. Now she lives on a quiet street of shabby wood-frame houses, chopped up as rental units, where the \u8220\'20\'1CNo Trespassing" signs are in English and Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Her home near downtown York is just blocks from the spot where the Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation in 1777, during the brief period when York was the new nation's capital.\par \par \uc2 Until this year, Cruz said she and her family \u8212\'20\'14 two undocumented adults, with three US-born children \u8212\'20\'14 felt like part of the melting pot culture in York, making their own small contribution to the city's diversity.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt didn't matter, American or not American. It was one community," she said through a translator, during an interview at the local offices of CASA. \u8220\'20\'1CWe all fit in everywhere. We're all humans. We all have the same rights. Nobody would feel superior to others. Now everything has changed."\par \par \uc2 The disruption of the last year is baked into her domestic routines.\par \par \uc2 She washes clothes every other week instead of weekly \u8212\'20\'14 putting up with dirtier clothes \u8212\'20\'14 and avoids the laundromat. She buys more ingredients for the tacos and tamales she makes at home on each trip to the market, to cut down on shopping trips out in public. She rides the bus or walks, almost never driving a car, with its risks of tickets or accidents that would involve police.\par \par \uc2 Even \uc2 Walmart\uc2  is off limits. There are frequent, but unfounded, rumors in York's Latino community of federal agents roaming the aisles there.\par \par \uc2 The nation's new tone, she said, can be found in the behavior of a woman at the Price Rite discount grocery store, who shouted at Cruz as she spoke in Spanish to her son, saying, \u8220\'20\'1CYou're in America! You have to talk English!"\par \par \uc2 The disruptions in her life grew more intense in late March when her boyfriend \u8212\'20\'14 and father to two of her three children \u8212\'20\'14 was driving home from his construction job and got into a minor car accident. He immediately knew the implications of police involvement: He had no driver's license, much less any paperwork for being in this country.\par \par \uc2 He pleaded with the man in the other car to not call police, offering to pay cash for any damages. But the other motorist refused. Cruz's boyfriend was arrested and was taken to the York County Prison, which also houses men charged with murder and rape.\par \par \uc2 They could speak on the phone but, because she is not a US citizen, she could not visit him. When she put the children on the phone to talk to their father, she told them to hold back their tears, to not make him feel any worse that he already did.\par \par \uc2 Instead, they would say nothing, afraid that as soon as they opened their mouths the tears would flow.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhere is my father?" they asked over and over. \u8220\'20\'1CWhen is he coming back home? Why is he there?"\par \par \uc2 Authorities detained him for 15 days. Since his release he has been trying to obtain a work permit, an outcome that is uncertain. Cruz herselfhas a lawyer helping with a visa application and, with kids here, she thinks she stands a pretty good chance.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe only motivation I feel right now is I know my kids will go far in life," she says. \u8220\'20\'1CI know they will achieve whatever they want to."\par \par \uc2 Her 10-year-old son has a new goal in life. He wants to be an immigration lawyer, who will try cases for free.\par \par \uc2 Joe Sacco is a first-generation immigrant, his parents coming from Italy and instilling in him the value of hard work at an early age. But as the 75-year-old former law enforcement official looks at immigrants today, he sees something else, something that is gnawing at his country.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Mexican worker works hard. There's no doubt about it," Sacco says. \u8220\'20\'1CBut they drink hard and they commit a lot of crimes hard when they're off."\par \par \uc2 When his taxes go up to pay for the schools, he feels bitter about how much is going to educate the children of undocumented immigrants. When he walks around parts of downtown York \u8212\'20\'14 the area where Cruz and many other Hispanics live \u8212\'20\'14 he sees a rash of crime.\par \par \uc2 He says he feels sympathy for the children who came here accompanying their parents. His own father, he says, came over as an 8-year-old and almost immediately began working in the Pennsylvania coal mines, earning $1 a day by climbing down the shaft to make sure the canary was still alive.\par \par \uc2 But his parents came here legally, he says, while most immigrants today do not. And those people need to be sent home.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEven the ones living stable lives and everything like that, they're not citizens," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CThey're not green card holders. They're not a citizen of the United States of America."\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt's a shame they came illegally and they've been hiding all this time," he adds. \u8220\'20\'1CA lot of them work hard and are raising a family. But they're illegal. You can't just turn your back on the law."\par \par \uc2 To Sacco and thousands of others in York County, the unchecked flood of undocumented immigrants had gotten out of hand. To him, Trump's blunt language on the subject was so refreshing that Sacco backed him a week after he announced his campaign, later becoming a Trump delegate to the Republican National Convention.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou don't have a country without borders. You can't just let everybody in," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CIf Trump wants to send them back, it's a shame, but that's the way it has to be."\par \par \uc2 York County is only 7 percent Hispanic, according to the latest US Census data, and about the same percentage speak a language other than English at home. Both figures are well below the national average.\par \par \uc2 This is not known as a landing place for border-crossers. It's a place for people who crossed years ago, immigrant advocates say, and found their way to York. Many of them make up the low-wage workforce, in restaurants and pizza parlors, or the arduous, unrewarding work of picking apples or berries before moving on to another seasonal job.\par \par \uc2 And yet it is a place, despite being 1,800 miles from the Mexican border, where Trump's battle cry of \u8220\'20\'1CBuild the Wall" resonated. Scott Wagner, a state senator from York who is running for governor, filed legislation that would deny state grants for municipalities that don't help the federal government enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe're not a border town. We're in the middle of the mid-Atlantic. But it's the principle," said Sam Terroso, a strong Trump supporter who helps run a York-based industrial pipe distribution company. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a blue-collar, Americana area. People get up and take pride in going to work every day. And the immigration stuff was principled on the fact that Washington has really screwed this up, allowing people who come here illegally to stay."\par \par \uc2 Terroso said his personal trainer, whom he sees twice a week, is an immigrant from the Philippines who has a green card. He says the trainer is married with four kids, pays taxes, and frequently comments over the din of Fox News in the background: \u8220\'20\'1CWhat's wrong with people doing it the way I do it? Why can't everyone else do it the right way?"\par \par \uc2 The longer-established residents of York trace their heritage to Dutch, German, or Italian ancestors who came to the United States several generations ago, when there were few limits on immigration. Terroso's grandparents and great-grandparents came from Sicily and Germany.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll those people came here and worked hard and made a life for themselves; everyone appreciates immigration done right," Terroso said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut it's very frustrating when it's not done right and the government continues to fail the people who get up and work every day. .\u160\'00\'A0.\u160\'00\'A0. That's when the backlash comes."\par \par \uc2 York County was one of the places where the backlash was felt strongly, going for \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , 63 percent to 33 percent, over \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , and helping send him into office with a mandate to shake things up.\par \par \uc2 On Jan. 25, his fifth full day in office, Trump signed the executive order expanding the categories of undocumented immigrants who would be prioritized for deportation. Those priorities are a big factor in how the government uses its limited number of immigration agents.\par \par \uc2 While the Obama administration targeted those with an \u8220\'20\'1Caggravated felony" or a \u8220\'20\'1Csignificant misdemeanor," or who entered the country illegally after Jan. 1, 2014, the Trump administration prioritized almost anyone without immigration documents.\par \par \uc2 Trump also ordered a tripling of the number of \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  agents, laying the groundwork for many more arrests.\par \par \uc2 The new policy meant that undocumented immigrants stopped for minor traffic accidents could be deported. It meant that if ICE knocked on the door looking for one person who had since moved, but instead found four others, those people could be deported. Any infraction could put them on the radar.\par \par \uc2 And for people like Marco, a 30-year-old immigrant who came to the United States illegally from Mexico some 13 years earlier, it meant agents could suddenly appear outside his bedroom door shouting, \u8220\'20\'1CPolice!"\par \par \uc2 A few weeks after Trump signed the executive order, agents appeared at Marco's house at 5:30 a.m. After being let in by his roommate, the agents went upstairs, walked past the bedroom of his 7-year-old son, and knocked on Marco's bedroom door, where he was sleeping with his girlfriend and newborn daughter.\par \par \uc2 Marco, who spoke on the condition that his last name not be used, has no clue why he was targeted. He assumes that it is related to two prior citations for driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 He was taken away in handcuffs and released a few hours later and is now fighting his case largely on the grounds that there would be extreme hardship on his children if he was deported. Marco has returned to his job as a landscaper, where he does lawn work, including maintaining the yards of some Trump supporters.\par \par \uc2 Last year, during the election, he would remove Trump campaign signs to cut the grass, then carefully put them back in the same spot. One client joked with him when he showed up just after the election, saying she figured he would have been deported already.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey all voted for Trump and they all agree Mexicans are bad, Mexicans are taking our jobs," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut the people who voted for Trump have me doing their yard work. It makes no sense to me."\par \par \uc2 The nondescript Chinese restaurant in a strip mall is unremarkable in almost every way except one \u8212\'20\'14 it is just a mile from the York Immigration Court and prison, and ICE agents sometimes stop in for the $7.59 all-you-can-eat buffet of pizza and cheeseburgers along with fried rice and General Tso's chicken.\par \par \uc2 That turned out to be bad news for the immigrants who worked in the kitchen, as well as the restaurant's owner.\par \par \uc2 All of them had come to the United States five or so years ago, from Mexico and Central America. They all lived together in a house in York, a few miles away from the Aroma Buffet restaurant, with female employees living on one floor and male employees on another.\par \par \uc2 Among them were Carlos, the Guatemalan sushi chef. And Mario and Sebastian, the Mexicans who worked in the back. A white van sent by the restaurant would take them to work. Some opted to ride the city bus instead.\par \par \uc2 These workers came not necessarily in pursuit of a permanent life here, but instead to work hard, make good money, and send it home to their wives and children. They did little outside of work and, according to their attorney, none has a criminal record.\par \par \uc2 They played soccer on their one day off a week, and generally stuck to themselves.\par \par \uc2 One day in mid-February, the half-dozen immigrants got off a city bus and walked across the strip mall parking lot toward Aroma Buffet. A group of ICE agents lay in wait and promptly apprehended the workers, the same ones who had cooked ICE agents' food and washed their plates.\par \par \uc2 The arrest of his workers threw the owner, Jimmy Zheng, into an immediate labor crisis. He called one of his longest-serving workers that morning to tell her they were going to have to shut down, at least for a while.\par \par \uc2 Zheng told the restaurant's hostess, Tammy Beecher, that she might want to get a new job. If she did, he said, he would not be offended.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMy first thought," Beecher recalled, \u8220\'20\'1Cwas, 'I guess Trump is living up to his word.'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 Because the immigration agents ate at the restaurant, they knew where to set their ambush, according to the attorney for the detained workers, Stephen Converse.\par \par \uc2 When asked about the arrests, ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls said, \u8220\'20\'1CICE does not discuss specific tactics. All enforcement activities are conducted with the same level of professionalism and respect that ICE officers exhibit every day."\par \par \uc2 The workers had little legal claim to try to stay or to fight their case, so they agreed to leave the United States.\par \par \uc2 After a few weeks, the restaurant reopened with a new staff. But Zheng, who did not respond to numerous messages seeking comment, eventually put an ad in a Chinese-language newspaper and sold it.\par \par \uc2 One of the immigrants who didn't go to work on the day of the raid is still there. He said through a translator that he sends money home to Guatemala, trying to support his wife, three daughters, and one son.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe just come here to work," the 35-year-old worker said. \u8220\'20\'1CThere are bad people and good people. If they are deporting bad people, that's fine."\par \par \uc2 The York Immigration Court is part of a large complex on the outskirts of town, a blocky structure jutting as an appendage from the county prison. Judges hear cases in three courtrooms every weekday. It is one the two immigration courts in Pennsylvania; the other is in Philadelphia. Cases from West Virginia and Delaware get also get funneled to York.\par \par \uc2 Since Trump assumed office, business has been brisk.\par \par \uc2 Deportations have returned to levels not seen since George W. Bush's administration began a crackdown of immigrants who committed crimes, an initiative that continued through President Obama's first term.\par \par \uc2 In addition to a greater case-load, Trump's first year in office has seen a different category of immigrant coming before the court.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey are profiling Hispanics and picking up folks randomly with the pretext of a traffic stop or, more commonly 'looking for someone else' that no one has ever heard of," said Converse, comparing the practice to \u8220\'20\'1Cethnic cleansing through deportation."\par \par \uc2 The government denies the allegation.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CICE does not conduct sweeps, checkpoints, or raids that target aliens indiscriminately," said Walls, the spokesman for ICE.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CICE continues to focus its enforcement resources on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security. However .\u160\'00\'A0.\u160\'00\'A0. ICE does not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement."\par \par \uc2 Converse, who works out of an office in a two-story office on a busy road in York, said that the cases he used to have were harder to try, because his clients did not stand much of a chance.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTime after time, it was shoplifting, a DUI, or domestic violence," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThere was no way to fight the case. .\u160\'00\'A0.\u160\'00\'A0. Now I have cases I can do something with."\par \par \uc2 Increasingly, his clients are people with no criminal record who have been here for 10 or 15 years. They have children and are active in the community.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey don't just go to the church," he says, \u8220\'20\'1CThey're in the choir."\par \par \uc2 Ben and his family, sitting one day recently in Converse's office, are among those in the choir.\par \par \uc2 He was a top student \u8212\'20\'14 the salutatorian when he graduated this summer from William Penn High School, a public school in York. He is a prolific musician, playing in the local orchestra, and his family has become a fixture in the community.\par \par \uc2 Ben is among some 800,000 so-called Dreamers: immigrants brought here by their parents, who were granted protection under Obama but are now at risk \u8212\'20\'14 and increasingly on edge \u8212\'20\'14 under Trump.\par \par \uc2 The disconnect became painfully obvious earlier this year when Ben proudly held the presidential award for academic excellence in his hands, with the gold presidential seal affixed to it and several signatures honoring his accomplishment.\par \par \uc2 But when Ben looked at that distinctive signature of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , he recoiled.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI joked around," he recalled. \u8220\'20\'1CI need Wite-Out."\par \par \uc2 To Ben and his parents, there was no small irony in the fact that Trump was honoring him with one stroke of his pen, praising his academic accomplishments, while threatening to send him back to Mexico with another, signing an executive order ending a policy of allowing children brought as minors to the United States to stay.\par \par \uc2 Ben, who asked that the Globe not use his last name, is a 19-year-old freshman on a full scholarship studying electrical engineering at York College of Pennsylvania. Born in Mexico, he was brought to York by his parents when he was a toddler. He has known no other home.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI forget I wasn't born here, that I'm not a citizen, that I could get deported if something were to happen," he said.\par \par \uc2 He learned English, along with his father, by watching shows like \u8220\'20\'1CSouth Park" and \u8220\'20\'1CThe Simpsons."\par \par \uc2 While he excelled in school and his family became a fixture in York, the only one in their family with legal status was Ben's younger sister, who was born here. That changed in 2014 when Ben filed an application to be part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the so-called dreamers program, which allowed children of undocumented immigrants to achieve legal status.\par \par \uc2 For Ben, that meant he could get a driver's license and start filling out applications for college. It meant that his skills as a musician could continue to blossom in America.\par \par \uc2 Then Trump was elected. Ben wept that night, uncertain of what his future would hold.\par \par \uc2 Trump in September announced he was ending the DACA protections that had allowed Ben to come out from the shadows. Unless Congress acts, Ben will become an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  again when his paperwork expires in March 2019, when he'll be a college sophomore.\par \par \uc2 He's not sure what will happen. Will he be deported to Mexico, after living in this country since he was a year old? If he stays illegally, would he be allowed to participate in the co-op work programs that are required for graduation?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI always joke with my friends: I guess I have to get married somehow," he says, laughing that one of the only ways to obtain citizenship may be to marry a US woman. \u8220\'20\'1CIt's a joke. But it's a plan B."\par \par \uc2 Ben's parents say they pay their taxes and their car is insured. But at construction worksites where his father works, he is on the lookout for the white cars of ICE agents.

This story is the third of three gauging those effects in one Pennsylvania county. To read part 1, click here. To read part 2, click here.\par \par \uc2 YORK, Pa. \u8212\'20\'14 The crying starts when Anayeli Cruz talks about the new troubles in her life, the impact on her US-born children, about the changes in the country she has called home for 12 years.\par \par \uc2 When the sobs come, as they often do, her 2-year-old daughter climbs into her lap and tries to wipe away the tears.\par \par \uc2 Cruz attempts a smile, but her round, bubbly face crumples again as she describes details of her daily struggles: Fearful of who might call authorities and report her as an undocumented immigrant, she forbade her kids from trick-or-treating for Halloween. She tells the children they must play on the backyard swing set instead of at the public playground. She denied her son a birthday party because, as she put it, \u8220\'20\'1CYou never know what can happen."\par \par \uc2 It appears almost irrational from the outside, but the 28-year-old Mexican immigrant's fear is undeniable. She is afraid of certain neighbors. She is afraid to leave her home. She is afraid, above all, of President Trump and his immigration crackdown.\par \par \uc2 The paralyzing dread of deportation that Cruz feels is multiplied by the thousands here in York \u8212\'20\'14 a community that, because of its regional immigration court, is one of the largest hubs of detentions and deportations in Pennsylvania. That same apprehension is multiplied by the millions around the country.\par \par \uc2 Unlike his predecessor, who focused deportations on immigrants with a criminal history, Trump wants undocumented people of all kinds to be found, detained, and sent back to their home countries even if they have not committed a felony in the United States. He signed an executive order putting the new policy into effect just days after his inauguration, fulfilling a central campaign promise.\par \par \uc2 Now just being in the United States without government permission is grounds for being targeted by federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 This shift toward harsher treatment of immigrants has been one of the most tangible, and disruptive, actions of Trump's first year in office. Along with rising numbers of deportations, the accompanying worry and uncertainty in immigrant neighborhoods is its most tangible byproduct.\par \par \uc2 It's hard to plan for a future, after all, when that future can at any moment take the form of an immigration agent at your doorstep.\par \par \uc2 In York, the sense of vulnerability among immigrants is magnified by the community's small size. Most live in a tight cluster of wood-framed homes downtown; unlike big cities, the close quarters leave virtually nowhere to hide, particularly as York has not declared itself a \u8220\'20\'1Csanctuary city." The anxiety ripples from the strip malls on the outskirts of town to the apple orchards and dairy farms on the country roads, from the stoops on Queen Street downtown to the leafy college campus where undocumented immigrants once thought they had found refuge.\par \par \uc2 The county's immigration court \u8212\'20\'14 which sits next to the county prison where many immigrants awaiting hearings are held \u8212\'20\'14 is now one of the busiest in the country for processing deportations. It has ordered 1,546 deportations this year, which is up almost 40 percent over last year and almost as many as far larger cities such as Boston, Baltimore, and Las Vegas. The handful of immigration lawyers here are flooded with cases.\par \par \uc2 Sneaking into the United States, or overstaying your official welcome, has always carried risks, of course. But the hazards are much graver now.\par \par \uc2 Trump's promised crackdowns, and his pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border, are a big part of what got him elected. He promised as a candidate to deport by the millions, just like \uc2 Dwight Eisenhower\uc2 's \u8220\'20\'1COperation Wetback" campaign starting in 1954, which rounded up Mexicans in wholesale fashion. In office, Trump's early moves toward that model have been cheered by those who see illegal immigration as an intrusion on American life, undermining the integrity of the US economy.\par \par \uc2 But many of the people targeted for enforcement by Trump have been in the United States for years, even a decade or more, waiting for Washington to decide if they could win a path to legal status or even citizenship. That possibility now seems more remote than ever.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants report being afraid to drive or even come out of their homes. Some are preparing to give up custody of their US-born minor children, in the event they are picked up by immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll these people who have anything less than citizenship are now rattled," said Elizabeth Alex, a senior director of organizing and leadership at CASA, an immigrant rights group. \u8220\'20\'1CThe onion is peeling layer by layer and the whole community is realizing: None of us is safe anymore."\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 Cruz crossed the border illegally from Mexico into Arizona about 12 years ago, when she was a teenager. Now she lives on a quiet street of shabby wood-frame houses, chopped up as rental units, where the \u8220\'20\'1CNo Trespassing" signs are in English and Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Her home near downtown York is just blocks from the spot where the Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation in 1777, during the brief period when York was the new nation's capital.\par \par \uc2 Until this year, Cruz said she and her family \u8212\'20\'14 two undocumented adults, with three US-born children \u8212\'20\'14 felt like part of the melting pot culture in York, making their own small contribution to the city's diversity.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt didn't matter, American or not American. It was one community," she said through a translator, during an interview at the local offices of CASA. \u8220\'20\'1CWe all fit in everywhere. We're all humans. We all have the same rights. Nobody would feel superior to others. Now everything has changed."\par \par \uc2 The disruption of the last year is baked into her domestic routines.\par \par \uc2 She washes clothes every other week instead of weekly \u8212\'20\'14 putting up with dirtier clothes \u8212\'20\'14 and avoids the laundromat. She buys more ingredients for the tacos and tamales she makes at home on each trip to the market, to cut down on shopping trips out in public. She rides the bus or walks, almost never driving a car, with its risks of tickets or accidents that would involve police.\par \par \uc2 Even \uc2 Walmart\uc2  is off limits. There are frequent, but unfounded, rumors in York's Latino community of federal agents roaming the aisles there.\par \par \uc2 The nation's new tone, she said, can be found in the behavior of a woman at the Price Rite discount grocery store, who shouted at Cruz as she spoke in Spanish to her son, saying, \u8220\'20\'1CYou're in America! You have to talk English!"\par \par \uc2 The disruptions in her life grew more intense in late March when her boyfriend \u8212\'20\'14 and father to two of her three children \u8212\'20\'14 was driving home from his construction job and got into a minor car accident. He immediately knew the implications of police involvement: He had no driver's license, much less any paperwork for being in this country.\par \par \uc2 He pleaded with the man in the other car to not call police, offering to pay cash for any damages. But the other motorist refused. Cruz's boyfriend was arrested and was taken to the York County Prison, which also houses men charged with murder and rape.\par \par \uc2 They could speak on the phone but, because she is not a US citizen, she could not visit him. When she put the children on the phone to talk to their father, she told them to hold back their tears, to not make him feel any worse that he already did.\par \par \uc2 Instead, they would say nothing, afraid that as soon as they opened their mouths the tears would flow.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhere is my father?" they asked over and over. \u8220\'20\'1CWhen is he coming back home? Why is he there?"\par \par \uc2 Authorities detained him for 15 days. Since his release he has been trying to obtain a work permit, an outcome that is uncertain. Cruz herself has a lawyer helping with a visa application and, with kids here, she thinks she stands a pretty good chance.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe only motivation I feel right now is I know my kids will go far in life," she says. \u8220\'20\'1CI know they will achieve whatever they want to."\par \par \uc2 Her 10-year-old son has a new goal in life. He wants to be an immigration lawyer, who will try cases for free.\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 Joe Sacco is a first-generation immigrant, his parents coming from Italy and instilling in him the value of hard work at an early age. But as the 75-year-old former law enforcement official looks at immigrants today, he sees something else, something that is gnawing at his country.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Mexican worker works hard. There's no doubt about it," Sacco says. \u8220\'20\'1CBut they drink hard and they commit a lot of crimes hard when they're off."\par \par \uc2 When his taxes go up to pay for the schools, he feels bitter about how much is going to educate the children of undocumented immigrants. When he walks around parts of downtown York \u8212\'20\'14 the area where Cruz and many other Hispanics live \u8212\'20\'14 he sees a rash of crime.\par \par \uc2 He says he feels sympathy for the children who came here accompanying their parents. His own father, he says, came over as an 8-year-old and almost immediately began working in the Pennsylvania coal mines, earning $1 a day by climbing down the shaft to make sure the canary was still alive.\par \par \uc2 But his parents came here legally, he says, while most immigrants today do not. And those people need to be sent home.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEven the ones living stable lives and everything like that, they're not citizens," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CThey're not green card holders. They're not a citizen of the United States of America."\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt's a shame they came illegally and they've been hiding all this time," he adds. \u8220\'20\'1CA lot of them work hard and are raising a family. But they're illegal. You can't just turn your back on the law."\par \par \uc2 To Sacco and thousands of others in York County, the unchecked flood of undocumented immigrants had gotten out of hand. To him, Trump's blunt language on the subject was so refreshing that Sacco backed him a week after he announced his campaign, later becoming a Trump delegate to the Republican National Convention.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou don't have a country without borders. You can't just let everybody in," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CIf Trump wants to send them back, it's a shame, but that's the way it has to be."\par \par \uc2 York County is only 7 percent Hispanic, according to the latest US Census data, and about the same percentage speak a language other than English at home. Both figures are well below the national average.\par \par \uc2 This is not known as a landing place for border-crossers. It's a place for people who crossed years ago, immigrant advocates say, and found their way to York. Many of them make up the low-wage workforce, in restaurants and pizza parlors, or the arduous, unrewarding work of picking apples or berries before moving on to another seasonal job.\par \par \uc2 And yet it is a place, despite being 1,800 miles from the Mexican border, where Trump's battle cry of \u8220\'20\'1CBuild the Wall" resonated. Scott Wagner, a state senator from York who is running for governor, filed legislation that would deny state grants for municipalities that don't help the federal government enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe're not a border town. We're in the middle of the mid-Atlantic. But it's the principle," said Sam Terroso, a strong Trump supporter who helps run a York-based industrial pipe distribution company. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a blue-collar, Americana area. People get up and take pride in going to work every day. And the immigration stuff was principled on the fact that Washington has really screwed this up, allowing people who come here illegally to stay."\par \par \uc2 Terroso said his personal trainer, whom he sees twice a week, is an immigrant from the Philippines who has a green card. He says the trainer is married with four kids, pays taxes, and frequently comments over the din of Fox News in the background: \u8220\'20\'1CWhat's wrong with people doing it the way I do it? Why can't everyone else do it the right way?"\par \par \uc2 The longer-established residents of York trace their heritage to Dutch, German, or Italian ancestors who came to the United States several generations ago, when there were few limits on immigration. Terroso's grandparents and great-grandparents came from Sicily and Germany.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll those people came here and worked hard and made a life for themselves; everyone appreciates immigration done right," Terroso said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut it's very frustrating when it's not done right and the government continues to fail the people who get up and work every day. .\u160\'00\'A0.\u160\'00\'A0. That's when the backlash comes."\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 York County was one of the places where the backlash was felt strongly, going for \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , 63 percent to 33 percent, over \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , and helping send him into office with a mandate to shake things up.\par \par \uc2 On Jan. 25, his fifth full day in office, Trump signed the executive order expanding the categories of undocumented immigrants who would be prioritized for deportation. Those priorities are a big factor in how the government uses its limited number of immigration agents.\par \par \uc2 While the Obama administration targeted those with an \u8220\'20\'1Caggravated felony" or a \u8220\'20\'1Csignificant misdemeanor," or who entered the country illegally after Jan. 1, 2014, the Trump administration prioritized almost anyone without immigration documents.\par \par \uc2 Trump also ordered a tripling of the number of \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  agents, laying the groundwork for many more arrests.\par \par \uc2 The new policy meant that undocumented immigrants stopped for minor traffic accidents could be deported. It meant that if ICE knocked on the door looking for one person who had since moved, but instead found four others, those people could be deported. Any infraction could put them on the radar.\par \par \uc2 And for people like Marco, a 30-year-old immigrant who came to the United States illegally from Mexico some 13 years earlier, it meant agents could suddenly appear outside his bedroom door shouting, \u8220\'20\'1CPolice!"\par \par \uc2 A few weeks after Trump signed the executive order, agents appeared at Marco's house at 5:30 a.m. After being let in by his roommate, the agents went upstairs, walked past the bedroom of his 7-year-old son, and knocked on Marco's bedroom door, where he was sleeping with his girlfriend and newborn daughter.\par \par \uc2 Marco, who spoke on the condition that his last name not be used, has no clue why he was targeted. He assumes that it is related to two prior citations for driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 He was taken away in handcuffs and released a few hours later and is now fighting his case largely on the grounds that there would be extreme hardship on his children if he was deported. Marco has returned to his job as a landscaper, where he does lawn work, including maintaining the yards of some Trump supporters.\par \par \uc2 Last year, during the election, he would remove Trump campaign signs to cut the grass, then carefully putting them back in the same spot. One client joked with him when he showed up just after the election, saying she figured he would have been deported already.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey all voted for Trump and they all agree Mexicans are bad, Mexicans are taking our jobs," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut the people who voted for Trump have me doing their yard work. It makes no sense to me."\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 The nondescript Chinese restaurant in a strip mall is unremarkable in almost every way except one \u8212\'20\'14 it is just a mile from the York Immigration Court and prison, and ICE agents sometimes stop in for the $7.59 all-you-can-eat buffet of pizza and cheeseburgers along with fried rice and General Tso's chicken.\par \par \uc2 That turned out to be bad news for the immigrants who worked in the kitchen, as well as the restaurant's owner.\par \par \uc2 All of them had come to the United States five or so years ago, from Mexico and Central America. They all lived together in a house in York, a few miles away from the Aroma Buffet restaurant, with female employees living on one floor and male employees on another.\par \par \uc2 Among them were Carlos, the Guatemalan sushi chef. And Mario and Sebastian, the Mexicans who worked in the back. A white van sent by the restaurant would take them to work. Some opted to ride the city bus instead.\par \par \uc2 These workers came not necessarily in pursuit of a permanent life here, but instead to work hard, make good money, and send it home to their wives and children. They did little outside of work and, according to their attorney, none has a criminal record.\par \par \uc2 They played soccer on their one day off a week, and generally stuck to themselves.\par \par \uc2 One day in mid-February, the half-dozen immigrants got off a city bus and walked across the strip mall parking lot toward Aroma Buffet. A group of ICE agents lay in wait and promptly apprehended the workers, the same ones who had cooked ICE agents' food and washed their plates.\par \par \uc2 The arrest of his workers threw the owner, Jimmy Zheng, into an immediate labor crisis. He called one of his longest-serving workers that morning to tell her they were going to have to shut down, at least for a while.\par \par \uc2 Zheng told the restaurant's hostess, Tammy Beecher, that she might want to get a new job. If she did, he said, he would not be offended.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMy first thought," Beecher recalled, \u8220\'20\'1Cwas, 'I guess Trump is living up to his word.'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 Because the immigration agents ate at the restaurant, they knew where to set their ambush, according to the attorney for the detained workers, Stephen Converse.\par \par \uc2 When asked about the arrests, ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls said, \u8220\'20\'1CICE does not discuss specific tactics. All enforcement activities are conducted with the same level of professionalism and respect that ICE officers exhibit every day."\par \par \uc2 The workers had little legal claim to try to stay or to fight their case, so they agreed to leave the United States.\par \par \uc2 After a few weeks, the restaurant reopened with a new staff. But Zheng, who did not respond to numerous messages seeking comment, eventually put an ad in a Chinese-language newspaper and sold it.\par \par \uc2 One of the immigrants who didn't go to work on the day of the raid is still there. He said through a translator that he sends money home to Guatemala, trying to support his wife, three daughters, and one son.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe just come here to work," the 35-year-old worker said. \u8220\'20\'1CThere are bad people and good people. If they are deporting bad people, that's fine."\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 The York Immigration Court is part of a large complex on the outskirts of town, a blocky structure jutting as an appendage from the county prison. Judges hear cases in three courtrooms every weekday. It is one the two immigration courts in Pennsylvania; the other is in Philadelphia. Cases from West Virginia and Delaware get also get funneled to York.\par \par \uc2 Since Trump assumed office, business has been brisk.\par \par \uc2 Deportations have returned to levels not seen since George W. Bush's administration began a crackdown of immigrants who committed crimes, an initiative that continued through President Obama's first term.\par \par \uc2 In addition to a greater caseload, Trump's first year in office has seen a different category of immigrant coming before the court.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey are profiling Hispanics and picking up folks randomly with the pretext of a traffic stop or, more commonly 'looking for someone else' that no one has ever heard of," said Converse, comparing the practice to \u8220\'20\'1Cethnic cleansing through deportation."\par \par \uc2 The government denies the allegation.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CICE does not conduct sweeps, checkpoints, or raids that target aliens indiscriminately," said Walls, the spokesman for ICE.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CICE continues to focus its enforcement resources on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security. However .\u160\'00\'A0.\u160\'00\'A0. ICE does not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement."\par \par \uc2 Converse, who works out of an office in a two-story office on a busy road in York, said that the cases he used to have were harder to try, because his clients did not stand much of a chance.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTime after time, it was shoplifting, a DUI, or domestic violence," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThere was no way to fight the case. .\u160\'00\'A0.\u160\'00\'A0. Now I have cases I can do something with."\par \par \uc2 Increasingly, his clients are people with no criminal record who have been here for 10 or 15 years. They have children and are active in the community.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey don't just go to the church," he says, \u8220\'20\'1CThey're in the choir."\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 Ben and his family, sitting one day recently in Converse's office, are among those in the choir.\par \par \uc2 He was a top student \u8212\'20\'14 the salutatorian when he graduated this summer from William Penn High School, a public school in York. He is a prolific musician, playing in the local orchestra, and his family has become a fixture in the community.\par \par \uc2 Ben is among some 800,000 so-called Dreamers: immigrants brought here by their parents, who were granted protection under Obama but are now at risk \u8212\'20\'14 and increasingly on edge \u8212\'20\'14 under Trump.\par \par \uc2 The disconnect became painfully obvious earlier this year when Ben proudly held the presidential award for academic excellence in his hands, with the gold presidential seal affixed to it and several signatures honoring his accomplishment.\par \par \uc2 But when Ben looked at that distinctive signature of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , he recoiled.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI joked around," he recalled. \u8220\'20\'1CI need Wite-Out."\par \par \uc2 To Ben and his parents, there was no small irony in the fact that Trump was honoring him with one stroke of his pen, praising his academic accomplishments, while threatening to send him back to Mexico with another, signing an executive order ending a policy of allowing children brought as minors to the United States to stay.\par \par \uc2 Ben, who asked that the Globe not use his last name, is a 19-year-old freshman on a full scholarship studying electrical engineering at York College of Pennsylvania. Born in Mexico, he was brought to York by his parents when he was a toddler. He has known no other home.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI forget I wasn't born here, that I'm not a citizen, that I could get deported if something were to happen," he said.\par \par \uc2 He learned English, along with his father, by watching shows like \u8220\'20\'1CSouth Park" and \u8220\'20\'1CThe Simpsons."\par \par \uc2 While he excelled in school and his family became a fixture in York, the only one in their family with legal status was Ben's younger sister, who was born here. That changed in 2014 when Ben filed an application to be part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the so-called dreamers program, which allowed children of undocumented immigrants to achieve legal status.\par \par \uc2 For Ben, that meant he could get a driver's license and start filling out applications for college. It meant that his skills as a musician could continue to blossom in America.\par \par \uc2 Then Trump was elected. Ben wept that night, uncertain of what his future would hold.\par \par \uc2 Trump in September announced he was ending the DACA protections that had allowed Ben to come out from the shadows. Unless Congress acts, Ben will become an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  again when his paperwork expires in March 2019, when he'll be a college sophomore.\par \par \uc2 He's not sure what will happen. Will he be deported to Mexico, after living in this country since he was a year old? If he stays illegally, would he be allowed to participate in the co-op work programs that are required for graduation?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI always joke with my friends: I guess I have to get married somehow," he says, laughing that one of the only ways to obtain citizenship may be to marry a US woman. \u8220\'20\'1CIt's a joke. But it's a plan B."\par \par \uc2 Ben's parents say they pay their taxes and their car is insured. But at construction worksites where his father works, he is on the lookout for the white cars of ICE agents. The family does not drive long distances, worried that if a tire blows or the car breaks down, they will be vulnerable.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere are no more dreams," says his father, Alfonso. \u8220\'20\'1CJust nightmares."\par \par \uc2 Matt Viser can be reached at matt.viser@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 DISRUPTED AMERICA: One in a series of occasional articles examining how President Trump's ascendance and early moves have altered expectations and reality. This story is the third of three gauging those effects in one Pennsylvania county. To read part 1, click here. To read part 2, click here.\par \par \uc2 YORK, Pa. \u8212\'20\'14 The crying starts when Anayeli Cruz talks about the new troubles in her life, the impact on her US-born children, about the changes in the country she has called home for 12 years.\par \par \uc2 When the sobs come, as they often do, her 2-year-old daughter climbs into her lap and tries to wipe away the tears.\par \par \uc2 Cruz attempts a smile, but her round, bubbly face crumples again as she describes details of her daily struggles: Fearful of who might call authorities and report her as an undocumented immigrant, she forbade her kids from trick-or-treating for Halloween. She tells the children they must play on the backyard swing set instead of at the public playground. She denied her son a birthday party because, as she put it, \u8220\'20\'1CYou never know what can happen."\par \par \uc2 It appears almost irrational from the outside, but the 28-year-old Mexican immigrant's fear is undeniable. She is afraid of certain neighbors. She is afraid to leave her home. She is afraid, above all, of President Trump and his immigration crackdown.\par \par \uc2 The paralyzing dread of deportation that Cruz feels is multiplied by the thousands here in York \u8212\'20\'14 a community that, because of its regional immigration court, is one of the largest hubs of detentions and deportations in Pennsylvania. That same apprehension is multiplied by the millions around the country.\par \par \uc2 Unlike his predecessor, who focused deportations on immigrants with a criminal history, Trump wants undocumented people of all kinds to be found, detained, and sent back to their home countries even if they have not committed a felony in the United States. He signed an executive order putting the new policy into effect just days after his inauguration, fulfilling a central campaign promise.\par \par \uc2 Now just being in the United States without government permission is grounds for being targeted by federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 This shift toward harsher treatment of immigrants has been one of the most tangible, and disruptive, actions of Trump's first year in office. Along with rising numbers of deportations, the accompanying worry and uncertainty in immigrant neighborhoods is its most tangible byproduct.\par \par \uc2 It's hard to plan for a future, after all, when that future can at any moment take the form of an immigration agent at your doorstep.\par \par \uc2 In York, the sense of vulnerability among immigrants is magnified by the community's small size. Most live in a tight cluster of wood-framed homes downtown; unlike big cities, the close quarters leave virtually nowhere to hide, particularly as York has not declared itself a \u8220\'20\'1Csanctuary city." The anxiety ripples from the strip malls on the outskirts of town to the apple orchards and dairy farms on the country roads, from the stoops on Queen Street downtown to the leafy college campus where undocumented immigrants once thought they had found refuge.\par \par \uc2 The county's immigration court \u8212\'20\'14 which sits next to the county prison where many immigrants awaiting hearings are held \u8212\'20\'14 is now one of the busiest in the country for processing deportations. It has ordered 1,546 deportations this year, which is up almost 40 percent over last year and almost as many as far larger cities such as Boston, Baltimore, and Las Vegas. The handful of immigration lawyers here are flooded with cases.\par \par \uc2 Sneaking into the United States, or overstaying your official welcome, has always carried risks, of course. But the hazards are much graver now.\par \par \uc2 Trump's promised crackdowns, and his pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border, are a big part of what got him elected. He promised as a candidate to deport by the millions, just like \uc2 Dwight Eisenhower\uc2 's \u8220\'20\'1COperation Wetback" campaign starting in 1954, which rounded up Mexicans in wholesale fashion. In office, Trump's early moves toward that model have been cheered by those who see illegal immigration as an intrusion on American life, undermining the integrity of the US economy.\par \par \uc2 But many of the people targeted for enforcement by Trump have been in the United States for years, even a decade or more, waiting for Washington to decide if they could win a path to legal status or even citizenship. That possibility now seems more remote than ever.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants report being afraid to drive or even come out of their homes. Some are preparing to give up custody of their US-born minor children, in the event they are picked up by immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll these people who have anything less than citizenship are now rattled," said Elizabeth Alex, a senior director of organizing and leadership at CASA, an immigrant rights group. \u8220\'20\'1CThe onion is peeling layer by layer and the whole community is realizing: None of us is safe anymore."\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 Cruz crossed the border illegally from Mexico into Arizona about 12 years ago, when she was a teenager. Now she lives on a quiet street of shabby wood-frame houses, chopped up as rental units, where the \u8220\'20\'1CNo Trespassing" signs are in English and Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Her home near downtown York is just blocks from the spot where the Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation in 1777, during the brief period when York was the new nation's capital.\par \par \uc2 Until this year, Cruz said she and her family \u8212\'20\'14 two undocumented adults, with three US-born children \u8212\'20\'14 felt like part of the melting pot culture in York, making their own small contribution to the city's diversity.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt didn't matter, American or not American. It was one community," she said through a translator, during an interview at the local offices of CASA. \u8220\'20\'1CWe all fit in everywhere. We're all humans. We all have the same rights. Nobody would feel superior to others. Now everything has changed."\par \par \uc2 The disruption of the last year is baked into her domestic routines.\par \par \uc2 She washes clothes every other week instead of weekly \u8212\'20\'14 putting up with dirtier clothes \u8212\'20\'14 and avoids the laundromat. She buys more ingredients for the tacos and tamales she makes at home on each trip to the market, to cut down on shopping trips out in public. She rides the bus or walks, almost never driving a car, with its risks of tickets or accidents that would involve police.\par \par \uc2 Even \uc2 Walmart\uc2  is off limits. There are frequent, but unfounded, rumors in York's Latino community of federal agents roaming the aisles there.\par \par \uc2 The nation's new tone, she said, can be found in the behavior of a woman at the Price Rite discount grocery store, who shouted at Cruz as she spoke in Spanish to her son, saying, \u8220\'20\'1CYou're in America! You have to talk English!"\par \par \uc2 The disruptions in her life grew more intense in late March when her boyfriend \u8212\'20\'14 and father to two of her three children \u8212\'20\'14 was driving home from his construction job and got into a minor car accident. He immediately knew the implications of police involvement: He had no driver's license, much less any paperwork for being in this country.\par \par \uc2 He pleaded with the man in the other car to not call police, offering to pay cash for any damages. But the other motorist refused. Cruz's boyfriend was arrested and was taken to the York County Prison, which also houses men charged with murder and rape.\par \par \uc2 They could speak on the phone but, because she is not a US citizen, she could not visit him. When she put the children on the phone to talk to their father, she told them to hold back their tears, to not make him feel any worse that he already did.\par \par \uc2 Instead, they would say nothing, afraid that as soon as they opened their mouths the tears would flow.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhere is my father?" they asked over and over. \u8220\'20\'1CWhen is he coming back home? Why is he there?"\par \par \uc2 Authorities detained him for 15 days. Since his release he has been trying to obtain a work permit, an outcome that is uncertain. Cruz herself has a lawyer helping with a visa application and, with kids here, she thinks she stands a pretty good chance.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe only motivation I feel right now is I know my kids will go far in life," she says. \u8220\'20\'1CI know they will achieve whatever they want to."\par \par \uc2 Her 10-year-old son has a new goal in life. He wants to be an immigration lawyer, who will try cases for free.\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 Joe Sacco is a first-generation immigrant, his parents coming from Italy and instilling in him the value of hard work at an early age. But as the 75-year-old former law enforcement official looks at immigrants today, he sees something else, something that is gnawing at his country.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Mexican worker works hard. There's no doubt about it," Sacco says. \u8220\'20\'1CBut they drink hard and they commit a lot of crimes hard when they're off."\par \par \uc2 When his taxes go up to pay for the schools, he feels bitter about how much is going to educate the children of undocumented immigrants. When he walks around parts of downtown York \u8212\'20\'14 the area where Cruz and many other Hispanics live \u8212\'20\'14 he sees a rash of crime.\par \par \uc2 He says he feels sympathy for the children who came here accompanying their parents. His own father, he says, came over as an 8-year-old and almost immediately began working in the Pennsylvania coal mines, earning $1 a day by climbing down the shaft to make sure the canary was still alive.\par \par \uc2 But his parents came here legally, he says, while most immigrants today do not. And those people need to be sent home.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEven the ones living stable lives and everything like that, they're not citizens," he says. \u8220\'20\'1CThey're not green card holders. They're not a citizen of the United States of America."\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt's a shame they came illegally and they've been hiding all this time," he adds. \u8220\'20\'1CA lot of them work hard and are raising a family. But they're illegal. You can't just turn your back on the law."\par \par \uc2 To Sacco and thousands of others in York County, the unchecked flood of undocumented immigrants had gotten out of hand. To him, Trump's blunt language on the subject was so refreshing that Sacco backed him a week after he announced his campaign, later becoming a Trump delegate to the Republican National Convention.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou don't have a country without borders. You can't just let everybody in," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CIf Trump wants to send them back, it's a shame, but that's the way it has to be."\par \par \uc2 York County is only 7 percent Hispanic, according to the latest US Census data, and about the same percentage speak a language other than English at home. Both figures are well below the national average.\par \par \uc2 This is not known as a landing place for border-crossers. It's a place for people who crossed years ago, immigrant advocates say, and found their way to York. Many of them make up the low-wage workforce, in restaurants and pizza parlors, or the arduous, unrewarding work of picking apples or berries before moving on to another seasonal job.\par \par \uc2 And yet it is a place, despite being 1,800 miles from the Mexican border, where Trump's battle cry of \u8220\'20\'1CBuild the Wall" resonated. Scott Wagner, a state senator from York who is running for governor, filed legislation that would deny state grants for municipalities that don't help the federal government enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe're not a border town. We're in the middle of the mid-Atlantic. But it's the principle," said Sam Terroso, a strong Trump supporter who helps run a York-based industrial pipe distribution company. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a blue-collar, Americana area. People get up and take pride in going to work every day. And the immigration stuff was principled on the fact that Washington has really screwed this up, allowing people who come here illegally to stay."\par \par \uc2 Terroso said his personal trainer, whom he sees twice a week, is an immigrant from the Philippines who has a green card. He says the trainer is married with four kids, pays taxes, and frequently comments over the din of Fox News in the background: \u8220\'20\'1CWhat's wrong with people doing it the way I do it? Why can't everyone else do it the right way?"\par \par \uc2 The longer-established residents of York trace their heritage to Dutch, German, or Italian ancestors who came to the United States several generations ago, when there were few limits on immigration. Terroso's grandparents and great-grandparents came from Sicily and Germany.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll those people came here and worked hard and made a life for themselves; everyone appreciates immigration done right," Terroso said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut it's very frustrating when it's not done right and the government continues to fail the people who get up and work every day. .\u160\'00\'A0.\u160\'00\'A0. That's when the backlash comes."\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 York County was one of the places where the backlash was felt strongly, going for \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , 63 percent to 33 percent, over \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , and helping send him into office with a mandate to shake things up.\par \par \uc2 On Jan. 25, his fifth full day in office, Trump signed the executive order expanding the categories of undocumented immigrants who would be prioritized for deportation. Those priorities are a big factor in how the government uses its limited number of immigration agents.\par \par \uc2 While the Obama administration targeted those with an \u8220\'20\'1Caggravated felony" or a \u8220\'20\'1Csignificant misdemeanor," or who entered the country illegally after Jan. 1, 2014, the Trump administration prioritized almost anyone without immigration documents.\par \par \uc2 Trump also ordered a tripling of the number of \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  agents, laying the groundwork for many more arrests.\par \par \uc2 The new policy meant that undocumented immigrants stopped for minor traffic accidents could be deported. It meant that if ICE knocked on the door looking for one person who had since moved, but instead found four others, those people could be deported. Any infraction could put them on the radar.\par \par \uc2 And for people like Marco, a 30-year-old immigrant who came to the United States illegally from Mexico some 13 years earlier, it meant agents could suddenly appear outside his bedroom door shouting, \u8220\'20\'1CPolice!"\par \par \uc2 A few weeks after Trump signed the executive order, agents appeared at Marco's house at 5:30 a.m. After being let in by his roommate, the agents went upstairs, walked past the bedroom of his 7-year-old son, and knocked on Marco's bedroom door, where he was sleeping with his girlfriend and newborn daughter.\par \par \uc2 Marco, who spoke on the condition that his last name not be used, has no clue why he was targeted. He assumes that it is related to two prior citations for driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 He was taken away in handcuffs and released a few hours later and is now fighting his case largely on the grounds that there would be extreme hardship on his children if he was deported. Marco has returned to his job as a landscaper, where he does lawn work, including maintaining the yards of some Trump supporters.\par \par \uc2 Last year, during the election, he would remove Trump campaign signs to cut the grass, then carefully putting them back in the same spot. One client joked with him when he showed up just after the election, saying she figured he would have been deported already.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey all voted for Trump and they all agree Mexicans are bad, Mexicans are taking our jobs," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut the people who voted for Trump have me doing their yard work. It makes no sense to me."\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 The nondescript Chinese restaurant in a strip mall is unremarkable in almost every way except one \u8212\'20\'14 it is just a mile from the York Immigration Court and prison, and ICE agents sometimes stop in for the $7.59 all-you-can-eat buffet of pizza and cheeseburgers along with fried rice and General Tso's chicken.\par \par \uc2 That turned out to be bad news for the immigrants who worked in the kitchen, as well as the restaurant's owner.\par \par \uc2 All of them had come to the United States five or so years ago, from Mexico and Central America. They all lived together in a house in York, a few miles away from the Aroma Buffet restaurant, with female employees living on one floor and male employees on another.\par \par \uc2 Among them were Carlos, the Guatemalan sushi chef. And Mario and Sebastian, the Mexicans who worked in the back. A white van sent by the restaurant would take them to work. Some opted to ride the city bus instead.\par \par \uc2 These workers came not necessarily in pursuit of a permanent life here, but instead to work hard, make good money, and send it home to their wives and children. They did little outside of work and, according to their attorney, none has a criminal record.\par \par \uc2 They played soccer on their one day off a week, and generally stuck to themselves.\par \par \uc2 One day in mid-February, the half-dozen immigrants got off a city bus and walked across the strip mall parking lot toward Aroma Buffet. A group of ICE agents lay in wait and promptly apprehended the workers, the same ones who had cooked ICE agents' food and washed their plates.\par \par \uc2 The arrest of his workers threw the owner, Jimmy Zheng, into an immediate labor crisis. He called one of his longest-serving workers that morning to tell her they were going to have to shut down, at least for a while.\par \par \uc2 Zheng told the restaurant's hostess, Tammy Beecher, that she might want to get a new job. If she did, he said, he would not be offended.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMy first thought," Beecher recalled, \u8220\'20\'1Cwas, 'I guess Trump is living up to his word.'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 Because the immigration agents ate at the restaurant, they knew where to set their ambush, according to the attorney for the detained workers, Stephen Converse.\par \par \uc2 When asked about the arrests, ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls said, \u8220\'20\'1CICE does not discuss specific tactics. All enforcement activities are conducted with the same level of professionalism and respect that ICE officers exhibit every day."\par \par \uc2 The workers had little legal claim to try to stay or to fight their case, so they agreed to leave the United States.\par \par \uc2 After a few weeks, the restaurant reopened with a new staff. But Zheng, who did not respond to numerous messages seeking comment, eventually put an ad in a Chinese-language newspaper and sold it.\par \par \uc2 One of the immigrants who didn't go to work on the day of the raid is still there. He said through a translator that he sends money home to Guatemala, trying to support his wife, three daughters, and one son.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe just come here to work," the 35-year-old worker said. \u8220\'20\'1CThere are bad people and good people. If they are deporting bad people, that's fine."\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 The York Immigration Court is part of a large complex on the outskirts of town, a blocky structure jutting as an appendage from the county prison. Judges hear cases in three courtrooms every weekday. It is one the two immigration courts in Pennsylvania; the other is in Philadelphia. Cases from West Virginia and Delaware get also get funneled to York.\par \par \uc2 Since Trump assumed office, business has been brisk.\par \par \uc2 Deportations have returned to levels not seen since George W. Bush's administration began a crackdown of immigrants who committed crimes, an initiative that continued through President Obama's first term.\par \par \uc2 In addition to a greater caseload, Trump's first year in office has seen a different category of immigrant coming before the court.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey are profiling Hispanics and picking up folks randomly with the pretext of a traffic stop or, more commonly 'looking for someone else' that no one has ever heard of," said Converse, comparing the practice to \u8220\'20\'1Cethnic cleansing through deportation."\par \par \uc2 The government denies the allegation.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CICE does not conduct sweeps, checkpoints, or raids that target aliens indiscriminately," said Walls, the spokesman for ICE.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CICE continues to focus its enforcement resources on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security. However .\u160\'00\'A0.\u160\'00\'A0. ICE does not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement."\par \par \uc2 Converse, who works out of an office in a two-story office on a busy road in York, said that the cases he used to have were harder to try, because his clients did not stand much of a chance.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTime after time, it was shoplifting, a DUI, or domestic violence," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThere was no way to fight the case. .\u160\'00\'A0.\u160\'00\'A0. Now I have cases I can do something with."\par \par \uc2 Increasingly, his clients are people with no criminal record who have been here for 10 or 15 years. They have children and are active in the community.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey don't just go to the church," he says, \u8220\'20\'1CThey're in the choir."\par \par \uc2 . \u160\'00\'A0. \u160\'00\'A0.\par \par \uc2 Ben and his family, sitting one day recently in Converse's office, are among those in the choir.\par \par \uc2 He was a top student \u8212\'20\'14 the salutatorian when he graduated this summer from William Penn High School, a public school in York. He is a prolific musician, playing in the local orchestra, and his family has become a fixture in the community.\par \par \uc2 Ben is among some 800,000 so-called Dreamers: immigrants brought here by their parents, who were granted protection under Obama but are now at risk \u8212\'20\'14 and increasingly on edge \u8212\'20\'14 under Trump.\par \par \uc2 The disconnect became painfully obvious earlier this year when Ben proudly held the presidential award for academic excellence in his hands, with the gold presidential seal affixed to it and several signatures honoring his accomplishment.\par \par \uc2 But when Ben looked at that distinctive signature of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , he recoiled.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI joked around," he recalled. \u8220\'20\'1CI need Wite-Out."\par \par \uc2 To Ben and his parents, there was no small irony in the fact that Trump was honoring him with one stroke of his pen, praising his academic accomplishments, while threatening to send him back to Mexico with another, signing an executive order ending a policy of allowing children brought as minors to the United States to stay.\par \par \uc2 Ben, who asked that the Globe not use his last name, is a 19-year-old freshman on a full scholarship studying electrical engineering at York College of Pennsylvania. Born in Mexico, he was brought to York by his parents when he was a toddler. He has known no other home.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI forget I wasn't born here, that I'm not a citizen, that I could get deported if something were to happen," he said.\par \par \uc2 He learned English, along with his father, by watching shows like \u8220\'20\'1CSouth Park" and \u8220\'20\'1CThe Simpsons."\par \par \uc2 While he excelled in school and his family became a fixture in York, the only one in their family with legal status was Ben's younger sister, who was born here. That changed in 2014 when Ben filed an application to be part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the so-called dreamers program, which allowed children of undocumented immigrants to achieve legal status.\par \par \uc2 For Ben, that meant he could get a driver's license and start filling out applications for college. It meant that his skills as a musician could continue to blossom in America.\par \par \uc2 Then Trump was elected. Ben wept that night, uncertain of what his future would hold.\par \par \uc2 Trump in September announced he was ending the DACA protections that had allowed Ben to come out from the shadows. Unless Congress acts, Ben will become an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  again when his paperwork expires in March 2019, when he'll be a college sophomore.\par \par \uc2 He's not sure what will happen. Will he be deported to Mexico, after living in this country since he was a year old? If he stays illegally, would he be allowed to participate in the co-op work programs that are required for graduation?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI always joke with my friends: I guess I have to get married somehow," he says, laughing that one of the only ways to obtain citizenship may be to marry a US woman. \u8220\'20\'1CIt's a joke. But it's a plan B."\par \par \uc2 Ben's parents say they pay their taxes and their car is insured. But at construction worksites where his father works, he is on the lookout for the white cars of ICE agents. The family does not drive long distances, worried that if a tire blows or the car breaks down, they will be vulnerable.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere are no more dreams," says his father, Alfonso. \u8220\'20\'1CJust nightmares."\par \par \uc2 Matt Viser can be reached at matt.viser@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The White House issued this statement on the court's ruling late Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Today, the rule of law suffered another blow, as an unelected judge unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our Nation. Federal law explicitly states that \u8220\'20\'1Ca Federal, State or Local government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual." 8 U.S.C. 1373(a). That means, according to Congress, a city that prohibits its officials from providing information to federal immigration authorities \u8212\'20\'14 a sanctuary city \u8212\'20\'14 is violating the law. Sanctuary cities, like San Francisco, block their jails from turning over criminal aliens to Federal authorities for deportation. These cities are engaged in the dangerous and unlawful nullification of Federal law in an attempt to erase our borders.\par \par \uc2 Once again, a single district judge \u8212\'20\'14 this time in San Francisco \u8212\'20\'14 has ignored Federal immigration law to set a new immigration policy for the entire country. This decision occurred in the same sanctuary city that released the 5-time deported \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who gunned down innocent Kate Steinle in her father's arms. San Francisco, and cities like it, are putting the well-being of criminal aliens before the safety of our citizens, and those city officials who authored these policies have the blood of dead Americans on their hands. This San Francisco judge's erroneous ruling is a gift to the criminal gang and cartel element in our country, empowering the worst kind of human trafficking and sex trafficking, and putting thousands of innocent lives at risk.\par \par \uc2 This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge. Today's ruling undermines faith in our legal system and raises serious questions about circuit shopping. But we are confident we will ultimately prevail in the Supreme Court, just as we will prevail in our lawful efforts to impose immigration restrictions necessary to keep terrorists out of the Untied States.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, we will pursue all legal remedies to the sanctuary city threat that imperils our citizens, and continue our efforts to ramp up enforcement to remove the criminal and gang element from our country. Ultimately, this is a fight between sovereignty and open borders, between the rule of law and lawlessness, and between hardworking Americans and those who would undermine their safety and freedom.\par \par \uc2 Caption:\par \par \uc2 Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press/File\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020170426ed4q000ph\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

A murder charge will filed soon, according to Worcester District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr.'s office.\par \par \uc2 Colon-Ortiz, 31, was working in Princeton around the time of Marcotte's murder, but Early would not say what type of work he was doing, nor would he say where in the Central Massachusetts town he was working.\par \par \uc2 Early at a weekend press conference credited Marcotte for helping authorities to solve her murder. Her \u8220\'20\'1Cdetermined fight" for life left the DNA of her killer on her hands, he said.. Colon-Ortiz was arrested on Friday after a DNA test allegedly linked him to the murder scene.\par \par \uc2 Marcotte, a 27-year-old \uc2 Google\uc2  employee who lived in New York City, was visiting family in the rural Central Massachusetts town when she was killed Aug. 7. When she didn't return after an afternoon run, her family called police.\par \par \uc2 John R. Ellement of the Globe Staff contributed to this report.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Where is Trump's program for victims of crimes committed by US citizens?\par \par \uc2 Kudos to Jeff Jacoby for exposing the untruths about the supposedly extensive crimes that undocumented immigrants commit (\u8220\'20\'1CThe malicious fiction of the 'criminal alien,' " Opinion, March 8). In his address to Congress last month, President Trump documented a few criminal actions by immigrants to support his claim that the vastness of the problem warranted creation of the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement program, or VOICE. But isn't it ironic that he hasn't proposed the same type of program for victims of the millions of crimes committed by American citizens?\par \par \uc2 Eva Travers\par \par \uc2 Cambridge\par \par \uc2 Even one crime committed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is measurable \u8212\'20\'14 to victim\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CImmigration doesn't increase crime," writes Jeff Jacoby, \u8220\'20\'1Cit reduces it." Wrong. If only one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  breaks the law, that's one more crime on American soil than would have occurred otherwise.\par \par \uc2 To be mathematically (as well as politically) correct, Jacoby needed to specify \u8220\'20\'1Ccrime rate," which presupposes a denominator. A rate allows anyone who is interested to calculate how many law-abiding immigrants enter the country for each bad apple.\par \par \uc2 I'm guessing the families who fall victim to violence because of our porous borders don't spend a lot of time crunching those numbers.\par \par \uc2 Michael Smith\par \par \uc2 Cynthiana, Ky.\par \par \uc2 Those here illegally have every reason to behave lawfully\par \par \uc2 Jeff Jacoby's critique of the myth of immigrant crime was spot-on. One thing he left out was that illegal immigrants would probably want to keep a low profile, and so they would try to avoid things that might bring them to the attention of law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Steven Brooks\par \par \uc2 Whitman\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020170312ed3c000y2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The following are the full remarks from President Trump's address to Congress, as prepared for delivery and provided by the White House:\par \par \uc2 Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America:\par \par \uc2 Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\par \par \uc2 Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice \u8211\'20\'13- in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.\par \par \uc2 That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.\par \par \uc2 A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.\par \par \uc2 A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.\par \par \uc2 And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.\par \par \uc2 What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit.\par \par \uc2 Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.\par \par \uc2 All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.\par \par \uc2 In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our Independence.\par \par \uc2 It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.\par \par \uc2 But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?\par \par \uc2 I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.\par \par \uc2 For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.\par \par \uc2 We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit -- and so many other places throughout our land.\par \par \uc2 We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross -- and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.\par \par \uc2 And we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\par \par \uc2 Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -\u8211\'20\'13 families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.\par \par \uc2 But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus -- as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the chorus became an earthquake \u8211\'20\'13 and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first ... because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\par \par \uc2 Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.\par \par \uc2 Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.\par \par \uc2 Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.\par \par \uc2 Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.\par \par \uc2 And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.\par \par \uc2 Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.\par \par \uc2 It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.\par \par \uc2 Since my election, \uc2 Ford\uc2 , \uc2 Fiat-Chrysler\uc2 , \uc2 General Motors\uc2 , Sprint, Softbank, \uc2 Lockheed\uc2 , \uc2 Intel\uc2 , \uc2 Walmart\uc2 , and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.\par \par \uc2 The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.\par \par \uc2 We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials \u8211\'20\'13- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.\par \par \uc2 We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job\u8209\'20\'11crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.\par \par \uc2 We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs -- and I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.\par \par \uc2 Trump touts actions since taking office in speech to Congress\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://secure.brightcove.com/services/mobile/streaming/index/master.m3u8?videoId=5342407375001&pubId=245991542&secure=true"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://secure.brightcove.com/services/mobile/streaming/index/master.m3u8?videoId=5342407375001&pubId=245991542&secure=true}}}\par \par \uc2 Trump touts actions since taking office in speech to Congress\par \par \uc2 We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.\par \par \uc2 With the help of Prime Minister \uc2 Justin Trudeau\uc2 , we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\par \par \uc2 To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.\par \par \uc2 I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation.\par \par \uc2 We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed \u8211\'20\'13- but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.\par \par \uc2 For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.\par \par \uc2 As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.\par \par \uc2 To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\par \par \uc2 Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\par \par \uc2 According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home -\u8211\'20\'13 from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.\par \par \uc2 We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.\par \par \uc2 It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.\par \par \uc2 We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\par \par \uc2 That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe -- and to keep out those who would do us harm.\par \par \uc2 As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.\par \par \uc2 I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.\par \par \uc2 Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2  -- from my list of 20 judges -- who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, \uc2 Antonin Scalia\uc2 , will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge \uc2 Neil Gorsuch\uc2 , a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.\par \par \uc2 Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.\par \par \uc2 Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.\par \par \uc2 More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.\par \par \uc2 We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.\par \par \uc2 In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.\par \par \uc2 We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  in 2001.\par \par \uc2 Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.\par \par \uc2 And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.\par \par \uc2 Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.\par \par \uc2 But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.\par \par \uc2 Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.\par \par \uc2 My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.\par \par \uc2 We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.\par \par \uc2 Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes -- but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.\par \par \uc2 I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, \uc2 Harley-Davidson\uc2 . In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.\par \par \uc2 At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it's good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me -- without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.\par \par \uc2 They weren't even asking for change. But I am.\par \par \uc2 I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.\par \par \uc2 The first Republican President, \uc2 Abraham Lincoln\uc2 , warned that the \u8220\'20\'1Cabandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people."\par \par \uc2 Lincoln was right -- and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.\par \par \uc2 I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others \u8211\'20\'13- have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the \uc2 National Academy of Sciences\uc2 , our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\par \par \uc2 Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families \u8211\'20\'13- including immigrant families \u8211\'20\'13- enter the middle class.\par \par \uc2 I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.\par \par \uc2 If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.\par \par \uc2 Another Republican President, \uc2 Dwight D. Eisenhower\uc2 , initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program \u8211\'20\'13- the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.\par \par \uc2 America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country \u8211\'20\'13- twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\par \par \uc2 To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital \u8211\'20\'13- creating millions of new jobs.\par \par \uc2 This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.\par \par \uc2 Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.\par \par \uc2 Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor \uc2 Matt Bevin\uc2  of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State -- it is unsustainable and collapsing.\par \par \uc2 One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges \u8211\'20\'13- leaving many Americans with no choice at all.\par \par \uc2 Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?\par \par \uc2 We now know that all of those promises have been broken.\par \par \uc2 Obamacare is collapsing \u8211\'20\'13- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice \u8211\'20\'13- it is a necessity.\par \par \uc2 So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.\par \par \uc2 Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:\par \par \uc2 First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.\par \par \uc2 Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts \u8211\'20\'13- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.\par \par \uc2 Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\par \par \uc2 Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance \u8211\'20\'13 and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines \u8211\'20\'13- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.\par \par \uc2 Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.\par \par \uc2 Our citizens deserve this, and so much more \u8211\'20\'13- so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.\par \par \uc2 My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.\par \par \uc2 An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.\par \par \uc2 Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.\par \par \uc2 On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old -- and a sophomore at Notre Dame.\par \par \uc2 Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.\par \par \uc2 But our slow and burdensome approval process at the \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2  keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.\par \par \uc2 If we slash the restraints, not just at the \uc2 FDA\uc2  but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.\par \par \uc2 In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles.\par \par \uc2 But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind \u8211\'20\'13- and the souls \u8211\'20\'13- of every American child.\par \par \uc2 Education is the civil rights issue of our time.\par \par \uc2 I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.\par \par \uc2 Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.\par \par \uc2 We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.\par \par \uc2 But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\par \par \uc2 The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.\par \par \uc2 In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone \u8211\'20\'13- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.\par \par \uc2 This is not acceptable in our society.\par \par \uc2 Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.\par \par \uc2 But to create this future, we must work with \u8211\'20\'13- not against -\u8211\'20\'13 the men and women of law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 We must build bridges of cooperation and trust \u8211\'20\'13- not drive the wedge of disunity and division.\par \par \uc2 Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters \u8211\'20\'13 and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.\par \par \uc2 We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 And we must support the victims of crime.\par \par \uc2 I have ordered the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE \u8211\'20\'13- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.\par \par \uc2 Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.\par \par \uc2 Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\par \par \uc2 Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.\par \par \uc2 Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands \u8211\'20\'13- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis \u8211\'20\'13- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a criminal record and two prior deportations.\par \par \uc2 Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.\par \par \uc2 To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know \u8211\'20\'13- we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.\par \par \uc2 Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and \u8211\'20\'13- if they must \u8211\'20\'13- to fight and to win.\par \par \uc2 I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\par \par \uc2 My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.\par \par \uc2 Our veterans have delivered for this Nation \u8211\'20\'13- and now we must deliver for them.\par \par \uc2 The challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater.\par \par \uc2 And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.\par \par \uc2 We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \u8220\'20\'1CRyan" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero \u8211\'20\'13- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.\par \par \uc2 I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \u8220\'20\'1CRyan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies." Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom \u8211\'20\'13- we will never forget him.\par \par \uc2 To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.\par \par \uc2 Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.\par \par \uc2 We strongly support \uc2 NATO\uc2 , an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.\par \par \uc2 But our partners must meet their financial obligations.\par \par \uc2 And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.\par \par \uc2 We expect our partners, whether in \uc2 NATO\uc2 , in the Middle East, or the Pacific \u8211\'20\'13- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.\par \par \uc2 We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.\par \par \uc2 Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people \u8211\'20\'13- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.\par \par \uc2 We must learn from the mistakes of the past \u8211\'20\'13- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.\par \par \uc2 The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.\par \par \uc2 America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\par \par \uc2 We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\par \par \uc2 Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.\par \par \uc2 On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.\par \par \uc2 Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\par \par \uc2 Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Edison\uc2  showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.\par \par \uc2 Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\par \par \uc2 Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.\par \par \uc2 Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.\par \par \uc2 American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\par \par \uc2 Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.\par \par \uc2 And streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace -- and jobs where Americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask.\par \par \uc2 When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans.\par \par \uc2 This is our vision. This is our mission.\par \par \uc2 But we can only get there together.\par \par \uc2 We are one people, with one destiny.\par \par \uc2 We all bleed the same blood.\par \par \uc2 We all salute the same flag.\par \par \uc2 And we are all made by the same God.\par \par \uc2 And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.\par \par \uc2 The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.\par \par \uc2 We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.\par \par \uc2 The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.\par \par \uc2 And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.\par \par \uc2 From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears \u8211\'20\'13-\par \par \uc2 inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past \u8211\'20\'13-\par \par \uc2 and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\par \par \uc2 I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and --\par \par \uc2 Believe in yourselves.\par \par \uc2 Believe in your future.\par \par \uc2 And believe, once more, in America.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States.\par \par \uc2 Caption:\par \par \uc2 Trump touts actions since taking office in speech to Congress\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020170301ed2s000eh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This is Donald Trump's America:\par \par \uc2 Last week, a domestic violence victim went to a courthouse in El Paso County, Texas, to seek a protective order against her alleged abuser.\par \par \uc2 When she got there, though, she was apprehended by federal immigration officials, who were acting on a tip, presumably from her abuser.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI cannot recall an instance where ICE agents have gone into the domestic violence court, specifically looking for a victim of domestic violence," a shocked prosecutor told the local media. Now that immigrant women know immigration officials might be lurking at the courthouse, authorities fear that domestic violence victims will avoid police. It's not hyperbole to conclude that women might die as a result.\par \par \uc2 To the what-part-of-illegal-don't-you-understand crowd \u8212\'20\'14 the hard-liners who now include the president of the United States \u8212\'20\'14 the consequences of such indiscriminate immigration enforcement are irrelevant. After all, the domestic abuse victim, a Mexican national known only by her initials, I.E.G., was in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 And that's all that seems to matter now. Judging by Trump's executive orders and words, and ICE's actions, it's clear that immigration authorities have abandoned the concept that some illegal immigrants should be higher-priority cases for deportation than others. Take the case of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a 35-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and mother of two who had lived in Arizona since her teens and had been dutifully checking in with authorities. She was also deported last week amid the administration's new crackdown.\par \par \uc2 Throwing illegal immigrants out of the country however and wherever authorities find them might seem like Trump fulfilling a campaign promise. But as with so many of his other policies, the result of the deportation binge may well be the opposite of its stated purpose.\par \par \uc2 By lumping all 11 million illegal immigrants together, and making them all vulnerable to deportation, the administration isn't making America safer, or its economy healthier. First, the kitchen-sink strategy wastes federal resources. Every hour that ICE officials spend deporting Garcia de Rayos or arresting the El Paso domestic violence victim is time they could have spent focusing on finding and deporting the small number of violent criminals in the immigrant community.\par \par \uc2 The arbitrary deportations will also make immigrants afraid of talking to police, going to court, or interacting with the wider community. And all US residents \u8212\'20\'14 citizens and noncitizens, legal and illegal residents \u8212\'20\'14 will be less safe as a result. If you were hit by a drunk driver, and the only witness was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , would you want him to run away when the police came?\par \par \uc2 Nor will American workers benefit. Rather than help the nation's economy and open up more jobs for Americans, the result of deporting workers \u8212\'20\'14 or scaring them away from their jobs \u8212\'20\'14 will be reduced productivity and higher prices in domestic agriculture and construction, among other sectors.\par \par \uc2 If last year's campaign proved anything, it's that Trump and many of his supporters view illegal immigrants as people who have cheated the system and have no right to expect leniency or sympathy. But that simplistic, gut-level reaction is now pushing immigration policy down a dangerous path.\par \par \uc2 Trump's executive orders, along with the actions of ICE, have sent waves of confusion and fear through immigrant communities. Indeed, that seems to be at least part of the administration's motive, since the government doesn't actually have the ability to deport 11 million people. The message that all illegal immigrants must watch their backs may satisfy Trump's urges, but it comes at an enormous cost to public safety for all residents.\par \par \uc2 Caption:\par \par \uc2 Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos was locked in a van that was stopped in the street by protesters outside the \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  facility in Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 AP FILE PHOTO\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020170217ed2h000uo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Sign up here.\par \par \uc2 A fast-moving, explosive Friday story suggested the Trump administration was considering an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  deportation force of 100,000 National Guard troops, citing a memo that was being circulated.\par \par \uc2 Moments later, the AP reported that the idea was in a draft memo, and White House Press Secretary \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2  quickly said the story was "100 percent not true."\par \par \uc2 "I wish you guys had asked before you tweeted," he added.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press said they asked the White House and the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  Friday "and had not received a response from either."\par \par \uc2 This marks at least the third time the White House has, according to reports, not responded to reporters and later attacked it as fake news. There appears to be a pattern, and it might be a strategy from the White House to discredit the press.\par \par \uc2 First there was a Jan. 24 report in the Kansas City Star about a draft memo that included the Trump transition's team top 50 large infrastructure projects. Among the projects were improvements to the Kansas City airport, rail projects from California to New York, plus the expansion of the Green Line in Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 "Attempts to reach the White House were not immediately successful," reads the story.\par \par \uc2 The next day, the Star reported that the administration had said this infrastructure member, "was not an official White House document."\par \par \uc2 Just last week, President Trump played naive about fake-but-true news.\par \par \uc2 On Feb. 10, aboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters he was unaware that -- as the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  had reported the day before -- his then-National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, had discussed sanctions with Russian officials.\par \par \uc2 Trump said that he knew nothing about the story, even though he had been briefed on the situation days earlier by his White House counsel.\par \par \uc2 Later, Trump dismissed stories about Flynn and Russia as fake news, even after he asked Flynn to resign. He said the real story on Flynn was about reckless leaks from the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Now, in the AP's case, this might be an evolving and quickly-changing story.\par \par \uc2 But it's also possible -- although nearly impossible to prove -- that the White House set up the AP by not responding to their inquiries and only denying the report after it came out.\par \par \uc2 It is also possible that the AP got the story; the White House declined to respond; the story was published; and only then did the administration realize an immigration deportation force was a bad idea.\par \par \uc2 All of this plays perfeectly into Trump's efforts -- on full display during his Thursday press conference -- to make the press his foil.\par \par \uc2 James Pindell can be reached at james.pindell@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The collapse Wednesday of \uc2 Andrew Puzder\uc2 's nomination as US secretary of labor might turn out to be a historical footnote -- or it might mark a welcome turning point in the new Trump administration. Hopefully, it's a sign that the Republican Senate is waking up to its responsibility to act as a check on an administration that's shown nothing but incompetence as it staggers through its first month.\par \par \uc2 Puzder, a fast-food baron, withdrew from consideration after Republican senators made it clear to the White House that he lacked the votes needed for confirmation. He's the first, and so far only, Trump nominee turned aside by the Senate. Previously, the Republican-controlled body had rubber-stamped even obviously unqualified nominees like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\par \par \uc2 Is Puzder just that much worse than Trump's other picks? Or is the climate in Washington changing in just the days since the vote to confirm DeVos?\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration has careered from crisis to crisis, and on Monday night National Security Adviser Mike Flynn resigned over his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Trump's fellow Republicans are getting antsy. After trying to shield the new president from oversight, senators now seem to be leaning toward a more aggressive inquiry into the administration's Russian ties.\par \par \uc2 There were certainly good reasons for the Senate's refusal to approve Puzder. The head of the company that owns \uc2 Hardee's\uc2  and Carl's Jr., Puzder had come under criticism for his business record as well as allegations of domestic violence once lodged against him by his former wife. He also acknowledged hiring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  as a housekeeper, the sort of infraction that has sunk cabinet nominations in the past.\par \par \uc2 In the minds of Republican senators, the argument for approving bad Trump nominees and looking the other way at his scandals boils down to party loyalty. Senator \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  said as much, in an astonishingly candid comment Tuesday: "I just don't think it's useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party. . . . We'll never even get started with doing the things we need to do." Plus, given Trump's thin skin, there's no guarantee that he won't retaliate against his fellow Republicans in some fashion if they exercise their oversight responsibilities.\par \par \uc2 But the consequences of letting Trump rampage through Washington appear graver every day. His erratic foreign policy pronouncements on China, the Middle East, and Mexico have thrown international relations into turmoil. Conflicts of interest have crept into official White House communications. Congressmen have the power to mitigate the damage Trump is doing, but only if they use it. Hopefully, having drawn the line on Puzder will embolden them to do so more often.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020170216ed2g000us\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

In English, Danish, Hungarian, Spanish, and French with subtitles.\par \par \uc2 Treachery, betrayal, oppression, and subversion play a part in the five films that make up the program of "Oscar Nominated Short Films 2017: Live Action." But things are not as bleak as that description might suggest, and most of the nominees achieve a level of artistry that transforms sorrow into wisdom.\par \par \uc2 The betrayals of childhood, though small in comparison to the woes to come in adulthood, still cut deep, and the means to fight back are limited. In "Sing," from Hungarian filmmaker Kristof Deak, young Zsofi is overjoyed to participate in her new school's choir. Overseen by a charismatic director, the group accomplishes the remarkable feat of not only allowing all students to participate but also manages to win the top prizes every year. When Zsofi learns, to her sorrow, the secret of their success, she and her fellow members plan resistance. With a remarkable young cast Deak maintains with rare aptitude the children's point of view.\par \par \uc2 On the other side of the age spectrum, old people are also vulnerable to bad faith. In Swiss director Timo von Gunten's deft and non-manipulative "La Femme et le TGV," the ageless Jane Birkin plays Elise, an elderly woman living in a toy-like house at the edge of railroad tracks. For years without fail Elise has greeted the high-speed train that zooms past her home twice a day by waving a minute Swiss flag. One day a note from someone in the train lands in her yard, opening up her heart to love -- and heartbreak.\par \par \uc2 The three remaining shorts focus on issues of anomie, intolerance, and oppression.\par \par \uc2 The dispiriting routine of security guards in a parking garage takes a terpsichorean turn in Spanish filmmaker Juanjo Gimenez Pena's stark and powerful "Timecode." In Danish director Aske Bang's well-acted but manipulative "Silent Nights" Inger, a shy young woman with an alcoholic mother, seeks relief from her loneliness by volunteering at a homeless shelter. There she is moved by the plight of Kwame, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Ghana. They fall in love, and all seems blissful until Inger offers to marry Kwame so he can obtain Danish citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The best of the nominees, French director Selim Aazzazi's "Ennemis Interieurs," is also the most chilling. An Algerian-born man who has lived almost his whole life in France is interrogated by a detective, who is also of Arab descent. Taking place in a drab office with suggestive flashbacks, the film shows that the perfidy of individuals stems from the system that coerces them.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 OSCAR NOMINATED SHORT FILMS 2017: LIVE ACTION\par \par \uc2 At Kendall Square. 130 minutes.

Additionally, the cities want the judge to declare that they are not violating any federal laws and therefore cannot be subjected to the penalties outlined by the Trump administration.\par \par \uc2 "I'm hopeful this step will make our residents feel a little bit better, that at least they know their local government in Chelsea has their back," said Chelsea City Manager Thomas Ambrosino. "This executive order is very troubling because it seeks to penalize cities like Chelsea who have adopted these policies for public safety purposes, to make sure its residents feel safe and welcome."\par \par \uc2 "Sanctuary city" is a political term used to describe a municipality that declines by local ordinance to assist federal immigration authorities, under the belief it would cause immigrants to fear cooperating with local authorities, specifically police.\par \par \uc2 But in his Jan. 25 executive order, Trump said municipalities that hinder federal immigration enforcement -- in violation, in his view, of federal laws -- would be stripped of federal financial assistance.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the executive order argue that local governments should be able to enact rules that will help them build trust with their immigrant residents, without intrusion from the federal government or the threat of penalties.\par \par \uc2 "This executive order comes in and unconstitutionally coerces [the municipalities] to use local resources in a way that is contrary to important principles of local control, and the local officials' determination regarding what is best for their citizens, for the citizens of Chelsea and Lawrence," said Inez Friedman-Boyce, a partner at Goodwin, an international law firm with offices in Boston. The firm is working with the \uc2 Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights\uc2  and Economic Justice to represent the two cities pro bono.\par \par \uc2 "It's an unconstitutional effort to commandeer local resources to do the job of the federal government," she said.\par \par \uc2 Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee, added that, "The heart of this case is that there are dozens of communities in Massachusetts that have within their rights opted to deprioritize federal immigration enforcement to protect everyone within their communities." "This affects the day-to-day experience of immigrants living in sanctuary cities across the country, and we have to take a stand to protect those immigrant communities, starting in our own backyard."\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit mirrors one filed last week by San Francisco, the first in the country. The Lawrence and Chelsea case is believed to be the first filed in the Northeast.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuits come as immigrant rights advocates turn to the courts across the country, challenging Trump's separate travel ban temporarily prohibiting refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the country. A federal appeals court in San Francisco is considering whether to uphold a temporary restraining order halting the ban, after hearing arguments Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The president's order penalizing sanctuary cities, issued in his first week in office, reflected his campaign promise to retool the immigration system. He has argued that sanctuary cities harbor illegal immigrants who "breed crime." He has said that the defunding of cities could be a "weapon" he would use in immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 The executive order " titled "Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States" " asserted that any municipality that flouts federal immigration enforcement requirements would not be "eligible to receive federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes."\par \par \uc2 Ambrosino said Wednesday that Trump's orders have had a chilling effect on immigrant communities, while the purpose of a sanctuary city declaration is to make all residents feel welcome -- and comfortable with the local authorities, specifically police.\par \par \uc2 Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera criticized the president for "victimizing" immigrant cities like Lawrence and Chelsea, and said they should not be penalized for not doing the federal government's job of enforcing immigration law. He argued that the executive order is nothing more than a "political statement."\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit alleges the order fails to define a sanctuary city or how a local government would be flouting federal law, a violation of its due process rights against penalties, such as a loss of funding.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit also alleges the order infringes on states' rights by seeking to force municipalities to participate in federal immigration enforcement. Lawrence, Chelsea, Boston, Cambridge, and others have enacted ordinances that call on law enforcement to build trust by not enforcing the civil immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 In some cases, police are instructed not to inquire about immigration status. An officer could detain an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has a warrant for a separate crime, but not for a civil immigration offense.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit argues that municipalities still comply with a federal law that requires them to share or receive the immigration status of people with federal authorities, but it does not require them to proactively enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Espinoza-Madrigal said places like Chelsea and Lawrence, which he called gateway communities for immigrants and minorities, would be devastated by a loss of funding.\par \par \uc2 Chelsea, for example, counts on the federal government for $14 million of its annual budget of $170 million, or about 8 percent. The city is 62 percent Latino, and 21 percent of its residents live below the poverty level; 44 percent were born outside of the United States.\par \par \uc2 Lawrence counts on the federal government for $38 million of its $245 million annual budget, or more than 15 percent. The city is 74 percent Latino, and 28 percent live below the poverty line; 37 percent of its residents were born abroad.\par \par \uc2 Friedman-Boyce acknowledged that in some cases the government can set standards for programs it funds, for instance for educational or research grants. But, she argued, the executive order goes too far, threatening to end funding for things like housing and education to coerce local governments.\par \par \uc2 "I think a big piece of this is the level of coercion that is taking place," she said, "and the amount of funds that are put at risk."\par \par \uc2 Milton J.

But things are not as bleak as that description might suggest, and most of the nominees achieve a level of artistry that transforms sorrow into wisdom.\par \par \uc2 The betrayals of childhood, though small in comparison to the woes to come in adulthood, still cut deep, and the means to fight back are limited. In "Sing," from Hungarian filmmaker Kristof Deak, young Zsofi is overjoyed to participate in her new school's choir. Overseen by a charismatic director, the group accomplishes the remarkable feat of not only allowing all students to participate but also manages to win the top prizes every year. When Zsofi learns, to her sorrow, the secret of their success, she and her fellow members plan resistance. With a remarkable young cast Deak maintains with rare aptitude the children's point of view.\par \par \uc2 On the other side of the age spectrum, old people are also vulnerable to bad faith. In Swiss director Timo von Gunten's deft and non-manipulative "La Femme et le TGV," the ageless Jane Birkin plays Elise, an elderly woman living in a toy-like house at the edge of railroad tracks. For years without fail Elise has greeted the high-speed train that zooms past her home twice a day by waving a minute Swiss flag. One day a note from someone in the train lands in her yard, opening up her heart to love -- and heartbreak.\par \par \uc2 The three remaining shorts focus on issues of anomie, intolerance, and oppression.\par \par \uc2 The dispiriting routine of security guards in a parking garage takes a terpsichorean turn in Spanish filmmaker Juanjo Gimenez Pena's stark and powerful "Timecode." In Danish director Aske Bang's well-acted but manipulative "Silent Nights" Inger, a shy young woman with an alcoholic mother, seeks relief from her loneliness by volunteering at a homeless shelter. There she is moved by the plight of Kwame, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Ghana. They fall in love, and all seems blissful until Inger offers to marry Kwame so he can obtain Danish citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The best of the nominees, French director Selim Aazzazi's "Ennemis Interieurs," is also the most chilling. An Algerian-born man who has lived almost his whole life in France is interrogated by a detective, who is also of Arab descent. Taking place in a drab office with suggestive flashbacks, the film shows that the perfidy of individuals stems from the system that coerces them.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 OSCAR NOMINATED SHORT FILMS 2017: LIVE ACTION\par \par \uc2 At Kendall Square. 130 minutes.

But in his Jan. 25 executive order, Trump said that communities that hinder federal immigration enforcement - in violation, in his view, of federal laws - would be stripped of federal funding.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit that is to be filed by Lawrence and Chelsea Wednesday morning seeks to block enforcement of the executive order, and it seeks a federal judge's declaratory ruling that the communities are not in violation of any federal laws, and therefore could not be subjected to the penalties outlined in the executive order.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the executive order argue that local communities should be able to enact local rules that will help them build trust with their immigrant residents, without intrusion from the federal government or the threat that they would be penalized.\par \par \uc2 "This executive order comes in and unconstitutionally coerces (the communities) to use local resources in a way that is contrary to important principles of local control, and the local officials' determination regarding what is best for their citizens, for the citizens of Chelsea and Lawrence," said Inez Friedman-Boyce, a partner at Goodwin, an international law firm with offices in Boston. The law firm is working in partnership with the \uc2 Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights\uc2  and Economic Justice to represent the two communities pro bono.\par \par \uc2 "It's an unconstitutional effort to commandeer local resources to do the job of the federal government," she said.\par \par \uc2 Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee, added that "the heart of this case is that there are dozens of communities in Massachusetts that have within their rights opted to deprioritize federal immigration enforcement to protect everyone within their communities ... this affects the day-to-day experience of immigrants living in Sanctuary Cities across the country, and we have to take a stand to protect those immigrant communities, starting in our own back yard."\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit mirrors one that was filed last week by San Francisco, the first such case filed in the country. The one filed by Lawrence and Chelsea is believed to be the first filed in the Northeast.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuits come as immigrant rights advocates have filed lawsuits across the country challenging Trump's travel ban temporarily prohibiting refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the country. A federal appeals court in San Francisco is considering whether to uphold a temporary restraining order halting the ban, after hearing arguments in the case Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The president's executive order penalizing Sanctuary Cities, issued in his first week of office, was a hallmark of his campaign promise to reform the country's immigration system. He has argued that Sanctuary Cities harbor illegal immigrants who are largely responsible for crimes in inner-cities, and that they "breed crime." He has said that the defunding of cities could be a "weapon" he would use in immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 The executive order - titled "Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States" - asserted that any community that flouts federal immigration enforcement requirements would not be "eligible to receive federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes."\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit alleges that the executive order fails to define a Sanctuary City or how a community would be flouting federal law, a violation of the communities' due process rights against penalties, such as a loss of funding.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit also alleges that the executive order infringes on states' rights by seeking to force communities into participation with federal immigration enforcement. Communities, such as Lawrence and Chelsea, and Boston and Cambridge, have enacted local ordinances that call on local law enforcement to build trust with local communities by not enforcing civil immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 In some cases, for instance, police are instructed not to inquire about a resident's immigration status. A police officer could detain an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has a warrant for a separate crime, but not for the civil offense of immigration. The lawsuit alleges that immigrants would be reluctant to communicate with local police if they fear they would be reported to immigration authorities, compromising public safety at the local level.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit alleges that communities still comply with a federal law that requires them to share or receive the immigration status of people with federal authorities, but it does not require them to proactively enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Espinoza-Madrigal said that communities such as Chelsea and Lawrence, what he called gateway communities for local immigrants and minorities, would be devastated by a loss in funding.\par \par \uc2 Chelsea, for example, counts on the federal government funding for $14 million of its annual budget of $170 million, or close to 10 percent. The city is 62 percent Latino, and 21 percent of its residents live below the poverty level; 44 percent of its residents were born outside the United States.\par \par \uc2 Lawrence counts on the federal government for $38 million of its $245 million annual budget, or 15 percent. The city is 74 percent Latino, and 28 percent live below the poverty line; 37 percent of the city's residents were born outside the United States.\par \par \uc2 Friedman-Boyce acknowledged that in some cases the federal government can set standards for programs its funds, for instance for educational or research grants. But, she argued, the executive order goes too far in hijacking a significant percentage of the communities' funding, for housing and educational programs, to coerce the communities into following the federal government's immigration plan.\par \par \uc2 "I think a big piece of this is the level of coercion that is taking place," she said, "and the amount of funds that are put at risk."\par \par \uc2 Milton J.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 [...]Axelrod quotes Obama as saying that Bush had "taught him lessons in how to be a former president." Since the election, however, Obama has suggested that he may not take those lessons to heart.\par \par \uc2 In the months and years ahead, tens of millions of Americans will have strong feelings about Donald Trump's presidency, and most won't hesitate to express their views. One American who should is \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As he reverts to a private citizen come Jan. 20, Obama will have the same right as any American to speak his mind in public. Yet it's a right he should refrain from exercising when it comes to his successor. In the modern era, most former presidents have taken pains not to openly criticize or second-guess those who succeed them in office. That reticence is commendable.\par \par \uc2 David Axelrod, the chief strategist for Obama's presidential campaigns and a senior adviser during the president's first term, speaks glowingly of the way George W. Bush treated the man who followed him in the Oval Office. Not only was Bush "very gracious to us during the transition," Axelrod told The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  a few months ago, but he "has been unfailingly gracious and respectful since." In fact, Axelrod quotes Obama as saying that Bush had "taught him lessons in how to be a former president."\par \par \uc2 Since the election, however, Obama has suggested that he may not take those lessons to heart.\par \par \uc2 "I want to be respectful of the office and give the president-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance," Obama said at a press conference on Nov. 19. But immediately he added: "As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle, but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes."\par \par \uc2 Obama's words were understood as a signal that he may not shy away from publicly criticizing Trump -- a signal reinforced by his comments to the liberal activist group Organizing for Action about returning to the political fray once he leaves the White House. "You're going to see me early next year," he promised. "We're going to be in a position where we can start cooking up all kinds of great stuff to do."\par \par \uc2 Obama will be sorely, and understandably, tempted to push back if Trump moves to unwind achievements that Obama considers integral to his legacy -- the Iran nuclear deal, the Affordable Care Act, nondeportation of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  "DREAMers." He would be wise to resist that temptation and hold his tongue, just as Bush did when Obama routinely condemned his record and worked vigorously to overturn it.\par \par \uc2 Bush steadfastly refused to critique Obama's performance, even when prodded by reporters to do so.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think it does any good," he said in a 2013 interview. "It's a hard job. He's got plenty on his agenda. It's difficult. A former president doesn't need to make it any harder." Repeatedly, Bush has stressed that it's bad for the country "to have a former president undermine a current president."\par \par \uc2 Former presidents of both parties have agreed. After leaving the White House, Lyndon Johnson didn't trash Richard Nixon; \uc2 Gerald Ford\uc2  didn't publicly undercut \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2 ; George H.W. Bush was unfailingly respectful of \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 ; and Clinton didn't exploit his popularity to snipe at Bush 43. The only real exception has been \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2 , who has blasted his successors on numerous occasions, with little effect except to cement his reputation as a self-righteous nag.\par \par \uc2 In our angry and polarized culture, former presidents do more good when they don't pour partisan fuel on political fires. Trump, like every president, will face a chorus of opposition. Critics will be legion, with or without Obama. Far rarer will be voices of reconciliation and moderation -- especially voices reflecting the rare experience of having been chief executive.\par \par \uc2 As a former POTUS, Obama will have ready access to Trump. Nothing will impede him from communicating his concerns and rebukes in private conversation (which is where they are likeliest to have the greatest impact). In public, however, Obama ought to follow his predecessor's example: Be a model of gracious respect, and let others fling the brickbats.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Jacoby can be reached at jacoby@globe.com.

Bush treated the man who followed him in the Oval Office. [...]Axelrod quotes Obama as saying that Bush had "taught him lessons in how to be a former president." Since the election, however, Obama has suggested that he may not take those lessons to heart.\par \par \uc2 In the months and years ahead, tens of millions of Americans will have strong feelings about Donald Trump's presidency, and most won't hesitate to express their views. One American who should is \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As he reverts to a private citizen come Jan. 20, Obama will have the same right as any American to speak his mind in public. Yet it's a right he should refrain from exercising when it comes to his successor. In the modern era, most former presidents have taken pains not to openly criticize or second-guess those who succeed them in office. That reticence is commendable.\par \par \uc2 David Axelrod, the chief strategist for Obama's presidential campaigns and a senior adviser during the president's first term, speaks glowingly of the way George W.

In fact, Axelrod quotes Obama as saying that Bush had "taught him lessons in how to be a former president."\par \par \uc2 Since the election, however, Obama has suggested that he may not take those lessons to heart.\par \par \uc2 "I want to be respectful of the office and give the president-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance," Obama said at a press conference on Nov. 19. But immediately he added: "As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle, but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes."\par \par \uc2 Obama's words were understood as a signal that he may not shy away from publicly criticizing Trump -- a signal reinforced by his comments to the liberal activist group Organizing for Action about returning to the political fray once he leaves the White House. "You're going to see me early next year," he promised. "We're going to be in a position where we can start cooking up all kinds of great stuff to do."\par \par \uc2 Obama will be sorely, and understandably, tempted to push back if Trump moves to unwind achievements that Obama considers integral to his legacy -- the Iran nuclear deal, the Affordable Care Act, nondeportation of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  "dreamers." He would be wise to resist that temptation and hold his tongue, just as Bush did when Obama routinely condemned his record and worked vigorously to overturn it.\par \par \uc2 Bush steadfastly refused to critique Obama's performance, even when prodded by reporters to do so.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think it does any good," he said in a 2013 interview. "It's a hard job. He's got plenty on his agenda. It's difficult. A former president doesn't need to make it any harder." Repeatedly, Bush has stressed that it's bad for the country "to have a former president undermine a current president."\par \par \uc2 Ex-presidents of both parties have agreed. After leaving the White House, Lyndon Johnson didn't trash Richard Nixon; \uc2 Gerald Ford\uc2  didn't publicly undercut \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2 ; George H. W. Bush was unfailingly respectful of \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 ; and Clinton didn't exploit his popularity to snipe at Bush 43. The only real exception has been \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2 , who has blasted his successors on numerous occasions, with little effect except to cement his reputation as a self-righteous nag.\par \par \uc2 In our angry and polarized culture, former presidents do more good when they don't pour partisan fuel on political fires. Trump, like every president, will face a chorus of opposition. Critics will be legion, with or without Obama. Far rarer will be voices of reconciliation and moderation -- especially voices reflecting the rare experience of having been chief executive.\par \par \uc2 As a former POTUS, Obama will have ready access to Trump. Nothing will impede him from communicating his concerns and rebukes in private conversation (which is where they are likeliest to have the greatest impact). In public, however, Obama ought to follow his predecessor's example: Be a model of gracious respect, and let others fling the brickbats.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Jacoby can be reached at jacoby@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 According to federal data, 94 firearms traced to Maine were seized in Massachusetts in 2015.\par \par \uc2 A fiercely fought effort in Maine to expand background checks on gun sales continued late into Tuesday. At 11:15 p.m., opponents of the ballot question held a 51 percent to 49 percent advantage with 42 percent of the votes counted.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the bid to extend criminal checks to unlicensed gun sales, which are unregulated and unrecorded in Maine, argued the measure would provide much-needed scrutiny to transactions between private individuals. Currently, only buyers of guns purchased from federally licensed dealers undergo such checks.\par \par \uc2 The ballot effort has repercussions for Massachusetts, where Maine ranks second in the number of out-of-state guns recovered at crime scenes.\par \par \uc2 Judi Richardson of South Portland, whose daughter was shot in a 2010 home invasion, said the semiautomatic handgun used in the crime had been sold privately at a Maine gun show and could not be traced. A month after her daughter's shooting, the gun was used again in a Portland murder.\par \par \uc2 If background checks had been required, Richardson said, perhaps the gunman would have been arrested. "Background checks are the one tool we know that works," she said. "We're trying to save lives."\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the measure, in a state where hunting is a cherished pastime, call background checks an inconvenience, a financial burden, and an infringement of the rights of responsible gun owners to purchase and sell arms.\par \par \uc2 Kevin Webb, president of Uncle Henry's -- a Maine-based listing of classified ads that helps sell more than 2,000 guns a year, many without the need for criminal background checks -- said the effort would impose an extra cost on law-abiding gun owners "that is not their responsibility."\par \par \uc2 If the measure is approved, state law would force buyers in person-to-person sales to have background checks conducted at the premises of a federally licensed dealer, who would charge a fee.\par \par \uc2 "At the end of the day," Webb said, "you are not going to stop guns from getting into the hands of people who really want them."\par \par \uc2 Eighteen states plus the District of Columbia require background checks at least for handguns, according to David Farmer, campaign manager for Mainers for Responsible Gun Ownership, the leading advocate for the initiative. In Massachusetts, local police departments conduct background checks before issuing permits to purchase a firearm.\par \par \uc2 According to federal data, 94 firearms traced to Maine were seized in Massachusetts in 2015. That figure trailed only the 136 guns tracked to New Hampshire and the 419 firearms purchased in Massachusetts itself.\par \par \uc2 Unlike sales by a federally licensed dealer, private sales in Maine do not include any check for criminal convictions or other disqualifying criteria such as whether the buyer is a fugitive, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , or under a restraining order.\par \par \uc2 Gun sales in Maine are not registered with the state, and licenses to own a gun are not required, as in Massachusetts. Concealed weapons can be carried in Maine without a permit.\par \par \uc2 Todd Tolhurst, president of Gun Owners of Maine, said the ballot question would require burdensome background checks on "casual loans made between friends and neighbors," a practice that has long been common in Maine.\par \par \uc2 The Maine referendum attracted deep-pocketed interest from across the country, which helped raise more than $5 million for the background-checks campaign. A leading contributor was Everytown for Gun Safety, a group backed by former New York City mayor \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2 . California, Washington state, and Nevada also considered measures to tighten gun regulations.\par \par \uc2 Brian MacQuarrie can be reached at brian.macquarrie@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Credit: By Brian MacQuarrie Globe Staff\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020161109ecb9001nk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 According to federal data, 94 firearms traced to Maine were seized in Massachusetts in 2015.\par \par \uc2 A fiercely fought effort in Maine to expand background checks on gun sales eked out a slim lead in early voting returns Tuesday. At 10 p.m., the ballot question held a 51 percent to 49 percent advantage with 20 percent of the votes counted.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the bid to extend criminal checks to unlicensed gun sales, which now are unregulated and unrecorded in Maine, said the measure would provide much-needed scrutiny to transactions between private individuals. Currently, only buyers of guns purchased from federally licensed dealers undergo such checks.\par \par \uc2 The ballot effort has repercussions for Massachusetts, where Maine ranks second in the number of out-of-state guns recovered at crime scenes.\par \par \uc2 Judi Richardson of South Portland, whose daughter was shot in a 2010 home invasion, said the semiautomatic handgun used in the crime had been sold privately at a Maine gun show and could not be traced. A month after her daughter's shooting, the gun was used again in a Portland murder.\par \par \uc2 If background checks had been required, Richardson said, perhaps the gunman would have been arrested. "Background checks are the one tool we know that works," she said. "We're trying to save lives."\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the measure, in a state where hunting is a cherished pastime, call background checks an inconvenience, a financial burden, and an infringement of the rights of responsible gun owners to purchase and sell arms.\par \par \uc2 Kevin Webb, president of Uncle Henry's -- a Maine-based listing of classified ads that helps sell more than 2,000 guns a year, many without the need for criminal background checks -- said the effort would impose an extra cost on law-abiding gun owners "that is not their responsibility."\par \par \uc2 If the measure is approved, state law would force buyers in person-to-person sales to have background checks conducted at the premises of a federally licensed dealer, who would charge a fee.\par \par \uc2 "At the end of the day," Webb said, "you are not going to stop guns from getting into the hands of people who really want them."\par \par \uc2 Eighteen states plus the District of Columbia require background checks at least for handguns, according to David Farmer, campaign manager for Mainers for Responsible Gun Ownership, the leading advocate for the initiative. In Massachusetts, local police departments conduct background checks before issuing permits to purchase a firearm.\par \par \uc2 According to federal data, 94 firearms traced to Maine were seized in Massachusetts in 2015. That figure trailed only the 136 guns tracked to New Hampshire and the 419 firearms purchased in Massachusetts itself.\par \par \uc2 Unlike sales by a federally licensed dealer, private sales in Maine do not include any check for criminal convictions or other disqualifying criteria such as whether the buyer is a fugitive, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , or under a restraining order.\par \par \uc2 Gun sales in Maine are not registered with the state, and licenses to own a gun are not required, as in Massachusetts. Concealed weapons can be carried in Maine without a permit.\par \par \uc2 Todd Tolhurst, president of Gun Owners of Maine, said the ballot question would require burdensome background checks on "casual loans made between friends and neighbors," a practice that has long been common in Maine.\par \par \uc2 The Maine referendum attracted deep-pocketed interest from across the country, which helped raise more than $5 million for the background-checks campaign. A leading contributor was Everytown for Gun Safety, a group backed by former New York City mayor \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2 . California, Washington state, and Nevada also considered measures to tighten gun regulations.\par \par \uc2 Brian MacQuarrie can be reached at brian.macquarrie@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Credit: By Brian MacQuarrie Globe Staff\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020161109ecb800105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Though Kaine exaggerated the number of those who would be subject to Trump's \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  deportation plans and acted as though Trump hadn't walked back his comments on punishing women who obtain abortions, many of the charges he made about GOP nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  were accurate.\par \par \uc2 What can you say after an experience like Tuesday's vice presidential debate except this?\par \par \uc2 Cue Edgar Allan Poe's raven: Nevermore.\par \par \uc2 Those were minutes that dragged on like hours.\par \par \uc2 I called Republican \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  the winner on points, though less because he turned in an accomplished performance than because he wasn't annoyo-boyo. Democrat Tim Kaine proudly claimed that title.\par \par \uc2 Granted, it's hard to be a vice presidential candidate. It's harder still when your aim isn't so much to explain your party's policies as it is to attack your opponent's running mate. And that, sadly, has come to be the VP nominee's role.\par \par \uc2 Still, you can do it with some grace, dignity, and wit.\par \par \uc2 Not last night, however.\par \par \uc2 Kaine was every bit as grating as one of those yappy little terriers that are always barking and straining at their leashes. He obviously went into the debate with the charge of repeating three or four attack themes over and over and over again: \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's divisive comments about Mexican immigrants; his, um, leadership role in the birther idiocy; his failure to release his tax returns; and his disparagement of \uc2 John McCain\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Those were mostly fair points, but Kaine's repetition dulled their effect and rendered his presentation canned and tinny.\par \par \uc2 Much worse, however, was Kaine's attempt to keep Pence on the defensive by interrupting again and again and again. Let's be clear: Though Kaine exaggerated the number of those who would be subject to Trump's \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  deportation plans and acted as though Trump hadn't walked back his comments on punishing women who obtain abortions, many of the charges he made about GOP nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  were accurate. However, the manner in which he pursued them was like nails on a blackboard.\par \par \uc2 Off the top, Pence seemed to have a tougher challenge: Defend the many controversial and/or obnoxious remarks Trump has uttered. More often than not, Pence solved that problem, at least for the duration of the debate, by simply slipping free of that challenge. Instead, he often contented himself with a bemused shake of the head or an "oh, please, come on." Once, he even channeled the Gipper's debate line from 1980: "There you go again."\par \par \uc2 Problem: Although it might work in the moment, you can't simply pretend Trump isn't Trump or that he hasn't said what he has. There's a record there, and it's not that easily denied.\par \par \uc2 For my money, the most interesting moments for both men came in breaks from the overall bicker-fest. Pence, for example, was thought-provoking when he outlined his ideas for a more muscular approach to Syria, including possible military attacks against Bashar al-Assad's forces. It was surprising, meanwhile, to hear him describe Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  as a "small and bullying" figure and advocate a more aggressive posture toward the Russian leader, given Trump's many favorable comments about Putin and his generally accommodationist bent when it comes to Russia. But though that may be Pence's approach, so far, it's not one Trump has embraced.\par \par \uc2 Kaine's best moments came when he took time away from pestering Pence and actually outlined the differences between the Democratic and Republican approaches on the economy and on immigration. Those relatively crisp and effective policy-elucidation periods left me thinking the Democrat would have been better served had he spent more time calmly comparing and contrasting and less hectoring and interrupting.\par \par \uc2 To sum up, then: Kaine was probably more accurate and certainly more annoying. Pence's less frenetic, more conversational demeanor made him easier to listen to, but he wasn't particularly effective in quelling doubt about Trump, in no small part because he didn't apply himself to that task.\par \par \uc2 As a hard-right social-issues conservative, Pence is out of the American mainstream. Still, I expect many Republicans will find themselves wishing he, not Trump, was their ticket topper.\par \par \uc2 He's not, however -- and that's why I doubt his more polished, less grating debate performance will have any real effect on the race.\par \par \uc2 Scot Lehigh can be reached at lehigh@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The message was hailed by supporters and condemned by critics, who shared images of bloodied and lifeless children, a reminder of hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians killed and millions displaced by civil war.\par \par \uc2 Steve Jobs\uc2  was the son of a Skittle.\par \par \uc2 By which, in the parlance of Donald Trump's campaign, I mean that the father of the founder of Apple and \uc2 Pixar\uc2  was a Syrian migrant.\par \par \uc2 Stay with me here. After bombings in New York and New Jersey and a stabbing in a Minnesota mall, the Republican nominee's eldest son this week tweeted an image of a bowl of colorful candy with this message: "If I had a bowl of Skittles and told you just three would kill you, would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem." The message was hailed by supporters and condemned by critics, who shared images of bloodied and lifeless children, a reminder of hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians killed and millions displaced by civil war. The photographer of the Skittles image objected to its use without his permission and -- wait for it -- revealed he was a child refugee when his family fled Turkey's invasion of Cyprus.\par \par \uc2 The coup de grace came from a Skittles spokeswoman whose simple logic spoke eloquent volumes: "Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy." Trump's campaign retorted that Americans would rather be "safe" than "politically correct."\par \par \uc2 It's understandable that we worry about opening our doors to refugees after last weekend's attacks. Authorities arrested an Afghan-American for planting bombs and shot to death a Somali-American during the mall rampage and said both may have been inspired by Islamic extremism. Dozens were injured; mercifully, no one died.\par \par \uc2 Trump has shrewdly tapped into visceral fears of the "other" for political gain, demonizing Mexicans as job stealers, rapists, and killers, and Muslim refugees as terrorist plotters. He called for banning Muslims from entering the country, until "authorities can figure out" the problem, and stopping "immigration from any nation compromised by terrorism" (a definition that includes the United States, United Kingdom, and France). Last month in Arizona, Trump doubled down on building a wall separating Mexico and invited mothers of people killed by undocumented migrants onto his stage.\par \par \uc2 His scare tactics work because the stories he tells are scary.\par \par \uc2 And yet. Not to diminish the suffering of any victims or their families, but Trump's hideous caricature of doomsday danger posed by refugees and migrants bears no semblance to reality.\par \par \uc2 Study after study show that immigrants from any country, whether legal or illegal, are less likely to commit crimes and be imprisoned than native-born Americans. A 2015 report by the Immigration Policy Centerfound that while illegal immigration in the United States tripled between 1990 and 2013, violent crime dropped by half.\par \par \uc2 The reality of refugees, who undergo two years of security checks before even entering the United States, may surprise you even more. A November 2015 report from the \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2 , a libertarian think tank funded by the conservative Koch brothers, found that of 859,629 refugees who had entered the United States since 2001, only three were convicted of planning a terror attack abroad, and none perpetrated a domestic attack. Compare that with one in every 22,541 Americans who committed murder in 2014.\par \par \uc2 In a new report last week, Cato found that while foreign-born terrorists were responsible for most of the 3,432 terror deaths in the US from 1975 through 2015 (most of which happened on Sept. 11, 2001), the chance of an American being killed by a refugee in a terror attack is a scant 1 in 3.64 billion per year. The chance of being murdered by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is an infinitesimal 1 in 10.9 billion per year. That's one enormous bowl of Skittles.\par \par \uc2 Remember this next time Trump hypes the threat: Albert Einstein, the Dalai Lama, and Jesus were all refugees.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The message was hailed by supporters and condemned by critics, who shared images of bloodied and lifeless children, a reminder of hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians killed and millions displaced by civil war.\par \par \uc2 Steve Jobs\uc2  was the son of a Skittle.\par \par \uc2 By which, in the parlance of Donald Trump's campaign, I mean that the father of the founder of Apple was a Syrian migrant.\par \par \uc2 Stay with me here. After bombings in New York and New Jersey and a stabbing in a Minnesota mall, the Republican nominee's eldest son this week tweeted an image of a bowl of colorful candy with this message: "If I had a bowl of Skittles and told you just three would kill you, would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem." The message was hailed by supporters and condemned by critics, who shared images of bloodied and lifeless children, a reminder of hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians killed and millions displaced by civil war. The photographer of the Skittles image objected to its use without his permission and -- wait for it -- revealed he was a child refugee when his family fled Turkey's invasion of Cyprus.\par \par \uc2 The coup de grace came from a Skittles spokeswoman whose simple logic spoke eloquent volumes: "Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy." Trump's campaign retorted that Americans would rather be "safe" than "politically correct."\par \par \uc2 It's understandable that we worry about opening our doors to refugees after last weekend's attacks. Authorities arrested an Afghan-American for planting bombs and shot to death a Somali-American during the mall rampage and said both may have been inspired by Islamic extremism. Dozens were injured; mercifully, no one died.\par \par \uc2 Trump has shrewdly tapped into visceral fears of the "other" for political gain, demonizing Mexicans as job stealers, rapists, and killers, and Muslim refugees as terrorist plotters. He called for banning Muslims from entering the country, until "authorities can figure out" the problem, and stopping "immigration from any nation compromised by terrorism" (a definition that includes the United States, United Kingdom, and France). Last month in Arizona, Trump doubled down on building a wall separating Mexico and invited mothers of people killed by undocumented migrants onto his stage.\par \par \uc2 His scare tactics work because the stories he tells are scary.\par \par \uc2 And yet. Not to diminish the suffering of any victims or their families, but Trump's hideous caricature of doomsday danger posed by refugees and migrants bears no semblance to reality.\par \par \uc2 Study after study show that immigrants from any country, whether legal or illegal, are less likely to commit crimes and be imprisoned than native-born Americans. A 2015 report by the Immigration Policy Centerfound that while illegal immigration in the United States tripled between 1990 and 2013, violent crime dropped by half.\par \par \uc2 The reality of refugees, who undergo two years of security checks before even entering the United States, may surprise you even more. A November 2015 report from the \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2 , a libertarian think tank funded by the conservative Koch brothers, found that of 859,629 refugees who had entered the United States since 2001, only three were convicted of planning a terror attack abroad, and none perpetrated a domestic attack. Compare that with one in every 22,541 Americans who committed murder in 2014.\par \par \uc2 In a new report last week, Cato found that while foreign-born terrorists were responsible for most of the 3,432 terror deaths in the US from 1975 through 2015 (most of which happened on Sept. 11, 2001), the chance of an American being killed by a refugee in a terror attack is a scant 1 in 3.64 billion per year. The chance of being murdered by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is an infinitesimal 1 in 10.9 billion per year. That's one enormous bowl of Skittles.\par \par \uc2 Remember this next time Trump hypes the threat: Albert Einstein, the Dalai Lama, and Jesus were all refugees. Not bad for a trio of Skittles.\par \par \uc2 An earlier version of this column incorrectly stated \uc2 Steve Jobs\uc2  position at Pixar. The column has since been updated.\par \par \uc2 Indira A.R.

The concerns of a white citizenry feeling displaced have been reinforced by the rhetoric of Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , who swept most of the state in the Republican primary.\par \par \uc2 NORCROSS, Ga. -- One of the clearest signs of how times have changed in this little Southern town is literally a sign. It's the outline of a faded red, oblong Dairy Queen sign that towers over Buford Highway just a few miles from the city line.\par \par \uc2 It used to direct residents to a fast food franchise, a beacon of Americana, where a hamburger cost 79 cents. The building is gone now. Only the sign remains, and at its base is a Hispanic man with a machete, slicing open coconuts piled in the back of his trailer.\par \par \uc2 His English is shaky. His coconuts cost $4.\par \par \uc2 A generation ago, this Atlanta suburb was 95 percent white and rural with one little African-American neighborhood that was known as "colored town." But after a tidal wave of Hispanic and Asian immigrants who were attracted to Norcross by cheap housing and proximity to a booming job market, white people now make up less than 20 percent of the population in Norcross and surrounding neighborhoods. It's a shift so rapid that many of the longtime residents feel utterly disconnected from the place where they raised their children.\par \par \uc2 "It's not that much anger, but you don't feel comfortable knowing that all this is around you," said Billy Weathers, 79, who has lived in the area for his whole life and doesn't speak a lick of Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Many say they feel isolated in their own hometown, pushed to change their ways, to assimilate to the new arrivals instead of the other way around. They resent the shift, even knowing it's nobody's fault, really. And they have mostly kept their feelings to themselves. Who, they wonder, would listen to folks like us, anyway?\par \par \uc2 But this year, in Norcross and places like it, resentment has found its voice. The concerns of a white citizenry feeling displaced have been reinforced by the rhetoric of Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , who swept most of the state in the Republican primary.\par \par \uc2 His slogan, "Make America Great Again," appeals to people here who don't talk much to their newer neighbors anymore, not out of malice but because they often don't even share a common language. When Trump talks about building a wall between the United States and Mexico, these largely white Republicans nod in agreement.\par \par \uc2 "There used to be a place where we could go out to eat to get Southern cooking," said Billy's wife, JoAnn Weathers, 79. "Well there's no more Southerners left here. . . . They came from other countries and completely changed our lives."\par \par \uc2 It's an attitude that many in the elites of both parties are quick to dismiss as out-of-date, wrongheaded, and frankly kind of embarrassing. It sounds like racial prejudice, and sometimes is. But to simply ignore or belittle this sense of loss and isolation is to close your eyes and ears to nativist sentiments that predated Trump's rise, and even if he loses, aren't going away. The demographic tide all but guarantees it.\par \par \uc2 The number of Hispanics in Georgia nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, bringing their total to roughly 9 percent of the state's population. That's still a smaller proportion than in the nation, where the Hispanic population reached a record 55 million in 2014 -- 17.4 percent of the country's overall population, according to Census data.\par \par \uc2 But in this part of Georgia, the pace of change has been breathtaking.\par \par \uc2 Here, Hispanics are concentrated in places like Norcross, a small city outside Atlanta where a hot economy led to abundant jobs in building, hotel, and landscaping industries.\par \par \uc2 Those jobs attracted job-seekers of all ethnicities. And to accommodate all this growth, Greater Atlanta needed to build. The metro area led the country in building permits issued each year from 1994 and 2005, according to data from the \uc2 Atlanta Regional Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Norcross, once a sleepy bedroom community of about 3,000 people living on winding roads, attracted waves upon waves of these newcomers.\par \par \uc2 Part of the attraction was the cheap housing. Part of it was the easy access to interstate highways and the jobs in Atlanta. But also, once the area had a beachhead of immigrants, more came to live near family or acquaintances, according to Mary Odem, an associate professor at Emory University who has studied the immigrant influx in Georgia.\par \par \uc2 Now roughly 16,000 people live within the Norcross city limits, and about 40 percent are Hispanic. In 1980, only 23 people in the city were foreign-born.\par \par \uc2 This kind of population change, if sustained throughout the Atlanta area, will vastly improve the odds of Democrats running for office in Georgia. Already it's the reason why \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is roughly even with Trump in the polls here, a phenomenon that prompted her campaign to spend valuable resources running TV ads in a deep red state that has gone Democrat in a presidential election just once in the last 31/2 decades.\par \par \uc2 But the other side is a deep backlash to immigration, an adamant outlook that has taken hold here as in other parts of the country.\par \par \uc2 Four counties in Georgia signed up for a program that allows local police and sheriffs to check the immigration status of any person charged with a crime, including Gwinnett County, where Norcross is located. Those four places deported more than 1,300 illegal immigrants using the program in the last year, according to federal statistics.\par \par \uc2 The Georgia General Assembly in 2011 passed a far-reaching law aimed at making conditions inhospitable to undocumented immigrants, with provisions that barred them from using state services and made it easier for more local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 "I want to take care of our people. I don't want to take care of Mexico's people who are here illegally," said state Senator Renee Unterman, whose district is close to Norcross, during the contentious legislative debate. "I'm not spewing hate. I'm just talking about reality."\par \par \uc2 Trump won all but four of Georgia's 159 counties in the March Republican primary on his platform of sealing the border and deporting undocumented immigrants. His margins were high in the Norcross area, especially in the older neighborhoods that have seen an influx of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the white people who are here have been here for 20 years," explained James Bell, 64, speaking to a reporter outside a \uc2 Kroger\uc2  grocery store. "They have seen the neighborhood change and a lot of them are angry about it."\par \par \uc2 Bell, like many others interviewed, said he distinguishes between immigrants who are making an effort to fit into the existing culture and those who he thinks aren't trying to assimilate. The Vietnamese and the Koreans, he said, are at least keeping to themselves.\par \par \uc2 "The Latinos just throw it in your face. They're here for the money. They don't want to be American," Bell said. "They don't care about America."\par \par \uc2 He listed big changes that he's noticed: More renters in the neighborhood who seem to him to care little about the upkeep of their property, single-family houses that he says are filled with multiple families, garbage bins overflowing and litter in the streets.\par \par \uc2 There are also the subtler things that get under his skin.\par \par \uc2 "You can see them at the \uc2 Kroger\uc2  customer service center desk," he said, saying that many of his neighbors line up there to send money home to Mexico. It's a flow of cash leaving this little community, not building it.\par \par \uc2 And there's another annoyance, the kind of thing that isn't a big deal but grates at him. "That's why there's always a huge line at the service desk," Bell said. "If you want to buy a lottery ticket, good luck."\par \par \uc2 Norcross refers to both a compact incorporated town about 20 miles to the northeast of Atlanta and to a general swath in the southwestern portion of Gwinnett County. Old-time residents recall it as a rural outpost where upper-class Atlanta families would retreat to on summer weekends. They reminisce about when what has become Jimmy Carter Boulevard, a major thoroughfare, was just a dirt track.\par \par \uc2 There's still a historic downtown, but with a gastropub now and a specialty olive oil store. New town houses are springing up. But a sprawl of warehouses and a seemingly unsustainable number of used car lots surround the city center. Sixty-five percent of Norcross is zoned for business use. It's not unusual to have a residential cul-de-sac abutting industrial land. Most of the shopping is in strip malls dominated by businesses catering to the immigrant population.\par \par \uc2 One of these strip malls, smack in the middle of a neighborhood that had a high turnout for Trump, is anchored by an El Sol Supermarket. Pinatas hang from the ceiling and you can buy a bus ticket straight to Mexico. A few doors down, El Leon Insurance offers "total help," defined to include "Inmigracion, Divorcios and Accidentes De Auto."\par \par \uc2 The prevalence of Spanish signs and discourse can be a flashpoint for hostility between the longtime residents and the newer ones.\par \par \uc2 Pablo Casas moved to the town in November 1999 shortly after coming to the United States from Colombia on a student visa. "I don't know if you're familiar with the Hispanic culture, but we're kind of loud," he said.\par \par \uc2 When he gets together with friends, six or seven of them, the volume goes way up.\par \par \uc2 And white people will complain, he said, but not about the noise.\par \par \uc2 "They don't say 'Keep it down.' They say 'Speak English; this is America,"' he said.\par \par \uc2 He's worked for a few years in Norcross in an information technology business. There, he said, his boss would threaten to charge him and his colleagues 25 cents every time they spoke Spanish to each other.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't take it badly," Casas said, adding it felt more like gentle prodding than a threat.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes he feels the sting of discrimination -- more when he's working his second job overseeing a construction business that he owns.\par \par \uc2 Casas, however, can empathize with some of the longtime Norcross residents.\par \par \uc2 He left the Norcross area because of the same problems that those who remain confront. "To be honest with you, the area doesn't look that good," he said. "Not to talk bad about my fellow immigrants, but a lot of them didn't have the same mind-set that we have to make a home here."\par \par \uc2 Despite their burgeoning numbers, Hispanics aren't represented in top jobs on the Board of Education or County Commission. And that's made this area a target for Latino activists who filed a voting rights lawsuit last month alleging that district boundaries are drawn to minimize the voting power of Hispanics, blacks, and Asians. Blacks make up about 20 percent of Norcross's population.\par \par \uc2 Jose Perez tried to win office in 2010, seeking a seat that would represent Norcross on the County Commission -- he lost in part because of a whispering campaign that he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He was born in Cuba, but immigrated legally.\par \par \uc2 "That fear was there," he said. "I didn't do a good enough job introducing myself."\par \par \uc2 Some longtime residents have turned to state and county officials to change zoning and housing laws in a bid to preserve the old ways.\par \par \uc2 A leader in this effort is Faye McFarland, who cleans homes for a living and keeps a US flag flying near her front door.\par \par \uc2 The 70-year old recalled living in Germany when her husband was in the Army. None of the Germans catered to her wants and ways then, and she doesn't see why she's expected to do so now.\par \par \uc2 Her main complaint came when a Guatemalan family moved into a tiny ranch house next door. She said she counted 15 people living there. But what really set her off was that the family seemed to be running a siding and roofing business out of the home. About a dozen cars would be parked outside and supplies would be piled up, an eyesore in a residential neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 She felt like she was living next to a warehouse, and at night there would be work trucks parked on the lawn. Her new neighbors, she said, would simply pay fines for violating the zoning law but didn't change the way they were living.\par \par \uc2 "My quality of life was absolutely destroyed with all those folks and all of those vehicles," McFarland recalled.\par \par \uc2 She began going to City Council meetings. Armed with photographs and persistence, she'd make her case over and over. "We would put up the pictures and say, 'This is what I have to live beside,' " McFarland said.\par \par \uc2 The council finally passed an ordinance: Now only up to four cars can be parked on a driveway of a house in Norcross. Additional vehicles need a permit from the city.\par \par \uc2 Norcross Mayor Bucky Johnson said the ordinance has worked. "We had people parking all over the place," he said. "We don't have that situation anymore."\par \par \uc2 And McFarland's neighbors, perhaps tired of her calling various law and code enforcement agencies all the time, packed up and moved out.\par \par \uc2 "We have fought for this neighborhood," McFarland says. "We have really had to fight."\par \par \uc2 Fighting isn't what you want to do when you're pushing 80 years old. The Weathers family, who live across town, are more resigned to the changes in their neighborhood and don't feel they can do much.\par \par \uc2 They used to know everybody on Light Circle, their little cul-de-sac. Now they only know a few families; they call themselves the "holdouts."\par \par \uc2 "Every time somebody moves, most of the time, a foreigner bought their house," said Billy Weathers, 79.\par \par \uc2 That includes a home up the street from theirs, purchased by a Hispanic family. It's become a hub of sorts for an extended family that, to the Weatherses' taste, pays insufficient respect to property lines. From time to time they've seen people picking berries from their muscadine vines without permission.\par \par \uc2 "I have no idea how many people are there," said JoAnn Weathers. "There's a bunch of them there."\par \par \uc2 She doesn't like the attitude she observes from the newcomers: "Sometimes it seems they come in demanding things instead of being grateful," she said.\par \par \uc2 Norcross changed its zoning laws to address concerns about crowding. Occupancy is limited to one person per 150 square feet of total floor space, and the county has a similar rule. But the Weatherses don't call the police or code enforcement for these kinds of infractions -- they say it doesn't seem like the right thing to do.\par \par \uc2 Instead, they simmer privately with a sense of frustration and futility. "Our neighborhood and our little town is being run over by other people," said Billy Weathers. "You don't feel comfortable."\par \par \uc2 Both supported Trump in the primary and plan to vote for him in November; their grandson Seth has done some work for the candidate in the state.\par \par \uc2 They see Trump as an ally, but this support does comes with some reservations about the flamboyant businessman. "I fully believe that Trump can be a blessing," said JoAnn Weathers. "Scripture tells us to pray for those over us. We have to really pray hard. But it can work."\par \par \uc2 The changing complexion of the area has contributed to a shift in local job requirements too.\par \par \uc2 Take Deena Canfield. She's 55 years old. Single. White. She's lived around the area for her whole life. She moved back to Norcross from a neighboring county because it's inexpensive and she recently lost her job.\par \par \uc2 Canfield thought the largest hurdle she'd have to overcome in finding a new job was a felony conviction in the 1990s for stealing a rental car. Instead, she's encountering a different problem.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of employers are wanting you to be bilingual, which I find offensive," Canfield said. "This is America. Why do I need to speak a second language?"\par \par \uc2 But if you're running a business, and want to stay in business, change is necessary.\par \par \uc2 That's the attitude projected at the Howard Brothers, a grocery store turned hardware store that's been selling to the Norcross population for 61 years.\par \par \uc2 "I would say first of all the Howard family is a Christian family, I mean, a Christian business," said Andy Darnell, the store's head of marketing. "We have values that anybody should be treated the same. It doesn't matter who comes into our stores; we're there to serve them."\par \par \uc2 The older people know the business well, and the company likes to talk about customers it has had for three generations. "We had people who saw their dad buy a lawn mower from us," Darnell said.\par \par \uc2 Now Darnell is advertising on Spanish-speaking radio stations, and putting Spanish-speaking employees on the radio. To make these newer customers feel comfortable, they now make sure there's a Spanish-speaking salesperson at each of their five locations.\par \par \uc2 "That's really new to us," he said. "If we have to hire a cashier now we really think, 'We have to hire someone who can communicate on all levels.' "\par \par \uc2 It makes sense: Some of their biggest accounts at this point are Hispanic customers.\par \par \uc2 The other option is to close down. That's what happened to the Dairy Queen on Buford Highway.\par \par \uc2 It was first established in 1968 by a longtime resident who sold it in 1983 to a group that included Raish Momin.\par \par \uc2 "We did a tremendous kind of business there; all Americans were living there," recalled Momin, who came here in an earlier wave of immigration from India and became a US citizen. On some Fridays more than 400 cars would pull up to the drive-through.\par \par \uc2 Then the neighborhood began changing. Koreans and Mexicans moved in. The Americans, as he called them, left.\par \par \uc2 "You could not see any customers who loved the Dairy Queen," Momin said.\par \par \uc2 Momin, 56, said he cried the day he sold the business in 2004.\par \par \uc2 But it proved a wise decision. The customer base continued to shrink. The new owner couldn't keep it going and finally shuttered the restaurant. It was knocked down.\par \par \uc2 Now all that's left of the old place is the sign along Buford Highway where a new business has sprung up -- a man selling coconuts for $4.\par \par \uc2 Annie Linskey can be reached at annie.linskey@globe.com.

The concerns of a white citizenry feeling displaced have been reinforced by the rhetoric of Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , who swept most of the state in the Republican primary.\par \par \uc2 NORCROSS, Ga. -- One of the clearest signs of how times have changed in this little Southern town is literally a sign. It's the outline of a faded red, oblong Dairy Queen sign that towers over Buford Highway just a few miles from the city line.\par \par \uc2 It used to direct residents to a fast food franchise, a beacon of Americana, where a hamburger cost 79 cents. The building is gone now. Only the sign remains, and at its base is a Hispanic man with a machete, slicing open coconuts piled in the back of his trailer.\par \par \uc2 His English is shaky. His coconuts cost $4.\par \par \uc2 America on Edge: In Pa., boomers see the American Dream slipping away\par \par \uc2 A generation ago, this Atlanta suburb was 95 percent white and rural with one little African-American neighborhood that was known as "colored town." But after a tidal wave of Hispanic and Asian immigrants who were attracted to Norcross by cheap housing and proximity to a booming job market, white people now make up less than 20 percent of the population in Norcross and surrounding neighborhoods. It's a shift so rapid that many of the longtime residents feel utterly disconnected from the place where they raised their children.\par \par \uc2 "It's not that much anger, but you don't feel comfortable knowing that all this is around you," said Billy Weathers, 79, who has lived in the area for his whole life and doesn't speak a lick of Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Many say they feel isolated in their own hometown, pushed to change their ways, to assimilate to the new arrivals instead of the other way around. They resent the shift, even knowing it's nobody's fault, really. And they have mostly kept their feelings to themselves. Who, they wonder, would listen to folks like us, anyway?\par \par \uc2 But this year, in Norcross and places like it, resentment has found its voice. The concerns of a white citizenry feeling displaced have been reinforced by the rhetoric of Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , who swept most of the state in the Republican primary.\par \par \uc2 His slogan, "Make America Great Again," appeals to people here who don't talk much to their newer neighbors anymore, not out of malice but because they often don't even share a common language. When Trump talks about building a wall between the United States and Mexico, these largely white, Republicans nod in agreement.\par \par \uc2 "There used to be a place where we could go out to eat to get southern cooking," said Billy's wife, JoAnn Weathers, 79. "Well there's no more southerners left here. . . . They came from other countries and completely changed our lives."\par \par \uc2 It's an attitude that many in the elites of both parties are quick to dismiss as out-of-date, wrongheaded, and frankly kind of embarrassing. It sounds like racial prejudice, and sometimes is. But to simply ignore or belittle this sense of loss and isolation is to close your eyes and ears to nativist sentiments that predated Trump's rise, and even if he loses, aren't going away. The demographic tide all but guarantees it.\par \par \uc2 Divided Nation: A series examining the issues that polarize the American electorate.\par \par \uc2 The number of Hispanics in Georgia nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, bringing their total to roughly 9 percent of the state's population. That's still a smaller proportion than in the nation, where the Hispanic population reached a record 55 million in 2014 -- 17.4 percent of the country's overall population, according to Census data.\par \par \uc2 But in this part of Georgia, the pace of change has been breathtaking.\par \par \uc2 Here, Hispanics are concentrated in places like Norcross, a small city outside Atlanta where a hot economy led to abundant jobs in building, hotel, and landscaping industries.\par \par \uc2 Those jobs attracted job-seekers of all ethnicities. And to accommodate all this growth, Greater Atlanta needed to build. The metro area led the country in building permits issued each year from 1994 and 2005, according to data from the \uc2 Atlanta Regional Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Norcross, once a sleepy bedroom community of about 3,000 people living on winding roads, attracted waves upon waves of these newcomers.\par \par \uc2 Part of the attraction was the cheap housing. Part of it was the easy access to interstate highways and the jobs in Atlanta. But also, once the area had a beachhead of immigrants, more came to live near family or acquaintances, according to Mary Odem, an associate professor at Emory University who has studied the immigrant influx in Georgia.\par \par \uc2 Now roughly 16,000 people live within the Norcross city limits, and about 40 percent are Hispanic. In 1980, only 23 people in the city were foreign-born.\par \par \uc2 This kind of population change, if sustained throughout the Atlanta area, will vastly improve the odds of Democrats running for office in Georgia. Already it's the reason why \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is roughly even with Trump in the polls here, a phenomenon that prompted her campaign to spend valuable resources running TV ads in a deep red state that has gone Democrat in a presidential election just once in the last 31/2 decades.\par \par \uc2 But the other side is a deep backlash to immigration, an adamant outlook that has taken hold here as in other parts of the country.\par \par \uc2 Clinton, Trump deeply unpopular, polls show\par \par \uc2 Four counties in Georgia signed up for a program that allows local police and sheriffs to check the immigration status of any person charged with a crime, including Gwinnett County, where Norcross is located. Those four places deported more than 1,300 illegal immigrants using the program in the last year, according to federal statistics.\par \par \uc2 The Georgia General Assembly in 2011 passed a far-reaching law aimed at making conditions inhospitable to undocumented immigrants, with provisions that barred them from using state services and made it easier for more local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 "I want to take care of our people. I don't want to take care of Mexico's people who are here illegally," said state Senator Renee Unterman, whose district is close to Norcross, during the contentious legislative debate. "I'm not spewing hate. I'm just talking about reality."\par \par \uc2 Trump won all but four of Georgia's 159 counties in the March Republican primary on his platform of sealing the border and deporting undocumented immigrants. His margins were high in the Norcross area, especially in the older neighborhoods that have seen an influx of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the white people who are here have been here for 20 years," explained James Bell, 64, speaking to a reporter outside a \uc2 Kroger\uc2  grocery store. "They have seen the neighborhood change and a lot of them are angry about it."\par \par \uc2 Bell, like many others interviewed, said he distinguishes between immigrants who are making an effort to fit into the existing culture and those who he thinks aren't trying to assimilate. The Vietnamese and the Koreans, he said, are at least keeping to themselves.\par \par \uc2 "The Latinos just throw it in your face. They're here for the money. They don't want to be American," Bell said. "They don't care about America."\par \par \uc2 He listed big changes that he's noticed: More renters in the neighborhood who seem to him to care little about the upkeep of their property, single-family houses that he says are filled with multiple families, garbage bins overflowing and litter in the streets.\par \par \uc2 There are also the subtler things that get under his skin.\par \par \uc2 "You can see them at the \uc2 Kroger\uc2  customer service center desk," he said, saying that many of his neighbors line up there to send money home to Mexico. It's a flow of cash leaving this little community, not building it.\par \par \uc2 And there's another annoyance, the kind of thing that isn't a big deal but grates at him. "That's why there's always a huge line at the service desk," Bell said. "If you want to buy a lottery ticket, good luck."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Norcross refers to both a compact incorporated town about 20 miles to the northeast of Atlanta and to a general swath in the southwestern portion of Gwinnett County. Old-time residents recall it as a rural outpost where upper-class Atlanta families would retreat to on summer weekends. They reminisce about when what has become Jimmy Carter Boulevard, a major thoroughfare, was just a dirt track.\par \par \uc2 There's still a historic downtown, but with a gastropub now and a specialty olive oil store. New town houses are springing up. But a sprawl of warehouses and a seemingly unsustainable number of used car lots surrounds the city center. Sixty-five percent of Norcross is zoned for business use. It's not unusual to have a residential cul-de-sac abutting industrial land. Most of the shopping is in strip malls dominated by businesses catering to the immigrant population.\par \par \uc2 Ground Game: Is the presidential election essentially over?\par \par \uc2 One of these strip malls, smack in the middle of a neighborhood that had a high turnout for Trump, is anchored by an El Sol Supermarket. Pinatas hang from the ceiling and you can buy a bus ticket straight to Mexico. A few doors down, El Leon Insurance offers "total help," defined to include "Inmigracion, Divorcios and Accidentes De Auto."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 The prevalence of Spanish signs and discourse can be a flashpoint for hostility between the longtime residents and the newer ones.\par \par \uc2 Pablo Casas moved to the town in November 1999 shortly after coming to the United States from Colombia on a student visa. "I don't know if you're familiar with the Hispanic culture, but we're kind of loud," he said.\par \par \uc2 When he gets together with friends, six or seven of them, the volume goes way up.\par \par \uc2 And white people will complain, he said, but not about the noise.\par \par \uc2 "They don't say 'Keep it down.' They say 'Speak English; this is America,"' he said.\par \par \uc2 He's worked for a few years in Norcross in an information technology business. There, he said, his boss would threaten to charge him and his colleagues 25 cents every time they spoke Spanish to each other.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't take it badly," Casas said, adding it felt more like gentle prodding than a threat.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes he feels the sting of discrimination -- more when he's working his second job overseeing a construction business that he owns.\par \par \uc2 Casas, however, can empathize with some of the longtime Norcross residents.\par \par \uc2 He left the Norcross area because of the same problems that those who remain confront. "To be honest with you, the area doesn't look that good," he said. "Not to talk bad about my fellow immigrants, but a lot of them didn't have the same mind-set that we have to make a home here."\par \par \uc2 Despite their burgeoning numbers, Hispanics aren't represented in top jobs on the Board of Education or County Commission. And that's made this area a target for Latino activists who filed a voting rights lawsuit last month alleging that district boundaries are drawn to minimize the voting power of Hispanics, blacks, and Asians. Blacks make up about 20 percent of Norcross's population.\par \par \uc2 Jose Perez tried to win office in 2010, seeking a seat that would represent Norcross on the County Commission -- he lost in part because of a whispering campaign that he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He was born in Cuba, but immigrated legally.\par \par \uc2 "That fear was there," he said. "I didn't do a good enough job introducing myself."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Some longtime residents have turned to state and county officials to change zoning and housing laws in a bid to preserve the old ways.\par \par \uc2 A leader in this effort is Faye McFarland, who cleans homes for a living and keeps a US flag flying near her front door.\par \par \uc2 The 70-year old recalled living in Germany when her husband was in the Army. None of the Germans catered to her wants and ways then, and she doesn't see why she's expected to do so now.\par \par \uc2 Her main complaint came when a Guatemalan family moved into a tiny ranch house next door. She said she counted 15 people living there. But what really set her off was that the family seemed to be running a siding and roofing business out of the home. About a dozen cars would be parked outside and supplies would be piled up, an eyesore in a residential neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 She felt like she was living next to a warehouse, and at night there would be work trucks parked on the lawn. Her new neighbors, she said, would simply pay fines for violating the zoning law but didn't change the way they were living.\par \par \uc2 "My quality of life was absolutely destroyed with all those folks and all of those vehicles," McFarland recalled.\par \par \uc2 She began going to City Council meetings. Armed with photographs and persistence, she'd make her case over and over. "We would put up the pictures and say, 'This is what I have to live beside,' " McFarland said.\par \par \uc2 The council finally passed an ordinance: Now only up to four cars can be parked on a driveway of a house in Norcross. Additional vehicles need a permit from the city.\par \par \uc2 Norcross Mayor Bucky Johnson said the ordinance has worked. "We had people parking all over the place," he said. "We don't have that situation anymore."\par \par \uc2 And McFarland's neighbors, perhaps tired of her calling various law and code enforcement agencies all the time, packed up and moved out.\par \par \uc2 "We have fought for this neighborhood," McFarland says. "We have really had to fight."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Fighting isn't what you want to do when you're pushing 80 years old. The Weathers family, who live across town, are more resigned to the changes in their neighborhood and don't feel they can do much.\par \par \uc2 They used to know everybody on Light Circle, their little cul-de-sac. Now they only know a few families; they call themselves the "holdouts."\par \par \uc2 "Every time somebody moves, most of the time, a foreigner bought their house," said Billy Weathers, 79.\par \par \uc2 That includes a home up the street from theirs, purchased by a Hispanic family. It's become a hub of sorts for an extended family that, to the Weathers's taste, pays insufficient respect to property lines. From time to time they've seen people picking berries from their muscadine vines without permission.\par \par \uc2 "I have no idea how many people are there," said JoAnn Weathers. "There's a bunch of them there."\par \par \uc2 She doesn't like the attitude she observes from the newcomers: "Sometimes it seems they come in demanding things instead of being grateful," she said.\par \par \uc2 Ground Game: Clinton-Trump matchup is a zombie apocalypse\par \par \uc2 Norcross changed its zoning laws to address concerns about crowding. Occupancy is limited to one person per 150 square feet of total floor space, and the county has a similar rule. But the Weathers don't call the police or code enforcement for these kinds of infractions -- they say it doesn't seem like the right thing to do.\par \par \uc2 Instead, they simmer privately with a sense of frustration and futility. "Our neighborhood and our little town is being run over by other people," said Billy Weathers. "You don't feel comfortable."\par \par \uc2 Both supported Trump in the primary and plan to vote for him in November; their grandson Seth has done some work for the candidate in the state.\par \par \uc2 They see Trump as an ally, but this support does comes with some reservations about the flamboyant businessman. "I fully believe that Trump can be a blessing," said JoAnn Weathers. "Scripture tells us to pray for those over us. We have to really pray hard. But it can work."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 The changing complexion of the area has contributed to a shift in local job requirements too.\par \par \uc2 Take Deena Canfield. She's 55 years old. Single. White. She's lived around the area for her whole life. She moved back to Norcross from a neighboring county because it's inexpensive and she recently lost her job.\par \par \uc2 Canfield thought the largest hurdle she'd have to overcome in finding a new job was a felony conviction in the 1990s for stealing a rental car. Instead, she's encountering a different problem.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of employers are wanting you to be bilingual, which I find offensive," Canfield said. "This is America. Why do I need to speak a second language?"\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 But if you're running a business, and want to stay in business, change is necessary.\par \par \uc2 That's the attitude projected at the Howard Brothers, a grocery store turned hardware store that's been selling to the Norcross population for 61 years.\par \par \uc2 "I would say first of all the Howard family is a Christian family, I mean, a Christian business," said Andy Darnell, the store's head of marketing. "We have values that anybody should be treated the same. It doesn't matter who comes into our stores; we're there to serve them."\par \par \uc2 Evan Horowitz: One economy, two views on how to make it better\par \par \uc2 The older people know the business well, and the company likes to talk about customers it has had for three generations. "We had people who saw their dad buy a lawn mower from us," Darnell said.\par \par \uc2 Now Darnell is advertising on Spanish-speaking radio stations, and putting Spanish-speaking employees on the radio. To make these newer customers feel comfortable, they now make sure there's a Spanish-speaking salesperson at each of their five locations.\par \par \uc2 "That's really new to us," he said. "If we have to hire a cashier now we really think, 'We have to hire someone who can communicate on all levels."'\par \par \uc2 It makes sense: Some of their biggest accounts at this point are Hispanic customers.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 The other option is to close down. That's what happened to the Dairy Queen on Buford Highway.\par \par \uc2 It was first established in 1968 by a longtime resident who sold it in 1983 to a group that included Raish Momin.\par \par \uc2 "We did a tremendous kind of business there; all Americans were living there," recalled Momin, who came here in an earlier wave of immigration from India and became a US citizen. On some Fridays more than 400 cars would pull up to the drive-through.\par \par \uc2 Then the neighborhood began changing. Koreans and Mexicans moved in. The Americans, as he called them, left.\par \par \uc2 "You could not see any customers who loved the Dairy Queen," Momin said.\par \par \uc2 Momin, 56, said he cried the day he sold the business in 2004.\par \par \uc2 But it proved a wise decision. The customer base continued to shrink. The new owner couldn't keep it going and finally shuttered the restaurant. It was knocked down.\par \par \uc2 Now all that's left of the old place is the sign along Buford Highway where a new business has sprung up -- a man selling coconuts for $4.\par \par \uc2 Annie Linskey can be reached at annie.linskey@globe.com.

The Georgia General Assembly in 2011 passed a far-reaching law aimed at making conditions inhospitable to undocumented immigrants, with provisions that barred them from using state services and made it easier for more local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 NORCROSS, Ga. -- One of the clearest signs of how times have changed in this little southern town is literally a sign. It's the outline of a faded red, oblong Dairy Queen sign that towers over Buford Highway just a few miles from the city line.\par \par \uc2 It used to direct residents to a fast food franchise, a beacon of Americana, where a hamburger cost 79 cents. The building is gone now. Only the sign remains, and at its base is a Hispanic man with a machete, slicing open coconuts piled in the back of his trailer.\par \par \uc2 His English is shaky. His coconuts cost $4.\par \par \uc2 A generation ago, this Atlanta suburb was 95 percent white and rural with one little African- American neighborhood that was known as "colored town." But after a tidal wave of Hispanic and Asian immigrants who were attracted to Norcross by cheap housing and proximity to a booming job market, white people now make up less than 20 percent of the population in Norcross and surrounding neighborhoods. It's a shift so rapid that many of the longtime residents feel utterly disconnected from the place where they raised their children.\par \par \uc2 "It's not that much anger, but you don't feel comfortable knowing that all this is around you," said Billy Weathers, 79, who has lived in the area for his whole life and doesn't speak a lick of Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Many say they feel isolated in their own hometown, pushed to change their ways, to assimilate to the new arrivals instead of the other way around. They resent the shift, even knowing it's nobody's fault, really. And they have mostly kept their feelings to themselves. Who, they wonder, would listen to folks like us, anyway?\par \par \uc2 But this year, in Norcross and places like it, resentment has found its voice. The concerns of a white citizenry feeling displaced have been reinforced by the rhetoric of Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , who swept most of the state in the Republican primary.\par \par \uc2 His slogan, "Make America Great Again," appeals to people here who don't talk much to their newer neighbors anymore, not out of malice but because they often don't even share a common language. When Trump talks about building a wall between the United States and Mexico, these largely white, Republicans nod in agreement.\par \par \uc2 "There used to be a place where we could go out to eat to get southern cooking," said Billy's wife, JoAnn Weathers, 79. "Well there's no more southerners left here. . . . They came from other countries and completely changed our lives."\par \par \uc2 It's an attitude that many in the elites of both parties are quick to dismiss as out-of-date, wrongheaded, and frankly kind of embarrassing. It sounds like racial prejudice, and sometimes is. But to simply ignore or belittle this sense of loss and isolation is to close your eyes and ears to nativist sentiments that predated Trump's rise, and even if he loses, aren't going away. The demographic tide all but guarantees it.\par \par \uc2 The number of Hispanics in Georgia nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, bringing their total to roughly 9 percent of the state's population. That's still a smaller proportion than in the nation, where the Hispanic population reached a record 55 million in 2014 -- 17.4 percent of the country's overall population, according to Census data.\par \par \uc2 But in this part of Georgia, the pace of change has been breathtaking.\par \par \uc2 Here, Hispanics are concentrated in places like Norcross, a small city outside Atlanta where a hot economy led to abundant jobs in building, hotel, and landscaping industries.\par \par \uc2 Those jobs attracted job-seekers of all ethnicities. And to accommodate all this growth, Greater Atlanta needed to build. The metro area led the country in building permits issued each year from 1994 and 2005, according to data from the \uc2 Atlanta Regional Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Norcross, once a sleepy bedroom community of about 3,000 people living on winding roads, attracted waves upon waves of these newcomers.\par \par \uc2 Part of the attraction was the cheap housing. Part of it was the easy access to interstate highways and the jobs in Atlanta. But also, once the area had a beachhead of immigrants, more came to live near family or acquaintances, according to Mary Odem, an associate professor at Emory University who has studied the immigrant influx in Georgia.\par \par \uc2 Now roughly 16,000 people live within the Norcross city limits, and about 40 percent are Hispanic. In 1980, only 23 people in the city were foreign-born.\par \par \uc2 This kind of population change, if sustained throughout the Atlanta area, will vastly improve the odds of Democrats running for office in Georgia. Already it's the reason why \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is roughly even with Trump in the polls here, a phenomenon that prompted her campaign to spend valuable resources running TV ads in a deep red state that has gone Democrat in a presidential election just once in the last 31/2 decades.\par \par \uc2 But the other side is a deep backlash to immigration, an adamant outlook that has taken hold here as in other parts of the country.\par \par \uc2 Four counties in Georgia signed up for a program that allows local police and sheriffs to check the immigration status of any person charged with a crime, including Gwinnett County, where Norcross is located. Those four places deported more than 1,300 illegal immigrants using the program in the last year, according to federal statistics.\par \par \uc2 The Georgia General Assembly in 2011 passed a far-reaching law aimed at making conditions inhospitable to undocumented immigrants, with provisions that barred them from using state services and made it easier for more local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 "I want to take care of our people. I don't want to take care of Mexico's people who are here illegally," said state Senator Renee Unterman, whose district is close to Norcross, during the contentious legislative debate. "I'm not spewing hate. I'm just talking about reality."\par \par \uc2 Trump won all but four of Georgia's 159 counties in the March Republican primary on his platform of sealing the border and deporting undocumented immigrants. His margins were high in the Norcross area, especially in the older neighborhoods that have seen an influx of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the white people who are here have been here for 20 years," explained James Bell, 64, speaking to a reporter outside a \uc2 Kroger\uc2  grocery store. "They have seen the neighborhood change and a lot of them are angry about it."\par \par \uc2 Bell, like many others interviewed, said he distinguishes between immigrants who are making an effort to fit into the existing culture and those who he thinks aren't trying to assimilate. The Vietnamese and the Koreans, he said, are at least keeping to themselves.\par \par \uc2 "The Latinos just throw it in your face. They're here for the money. They don't want to be American," Bell said. "They don't care about America."\par \par \uc2 He listed big changes that he's noticed: More renters in the neighborhood who seem to him to care little about the upkeep of their property, single-family houses that he says are filled with multiple families, garbage bins overflowing and litter in the streets.\par \par \uc2 There are also the subtler things that get under his skin.\par \par \uc2 "You can see them at the \uc2 Kroger\uc2  customer service center desk," he said, saying that many of his neighbors line up there to send money home to Mexico. It's a flow of cash leaving this little community, not building it.\par \par \uc2 And there's another annoyance, the kind of thing that isn't a big deal but grates at him. "That's why there's always a huge line at the service desk," Bell said. "If you want to buy a lottery ticket, good luck."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Norcross refers to both a compact incorporated town about 20 miles to the northeast of Atlanta and to a general swath in the southwestern portion of Gwinnett County. Old-time residents recall it as a rural outpost where upper-class Atlanta families would retreat to on summer weekends. They reminisce about when what has become Jimmy Carter Boulevard, a major thoroughfare, was just a dirt track.\par \par \uc2 There's still a historic downtown, but with a gastropub now and a specialty olive oil store. New town houses are springing up. But a sprawl of warehouses and a seemingly unsustainable number of used car lots surrounds the city center. Sixty-five percent of Norcross is zoned for business use. It's not unusual to have a residential cul-de-sac abutting industrial land. Most of the shopping is in strip malls dominated by businesses catering to the immigrant population.\par \par \uc2 One of these strip malls, smack in the middle of a neighborhood that had a high turnout for Trump, is anchored by an El Sol Supermarket. Pinatas hang from the ceiling and you can buy a bus ticket straight to Mexico. A few doors down, El Leon Insurance offers "total help," defined to include "Inmigracion, Divorcios and Accidentes De Auto."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 The prevalence of Spanish signs and discourse can be a flashpoint for hostility between the longtime residents and the newer ones.\par \par \uc2 Pablo Casas moved to the town in November 1999 shortly after coming to the United States from Colombia on a student visa. "I don't know if you're familiar with the Hispanic culture, but we're kind of loud," he said.\par \par \uc2 When he gets together with friends, six or seven of them, the volume goes way up.\par \par \uc2 And white people will complain, he said, but not about the noise.\par \par \uc2 "They don't say 'Keep it down.' They say 'Speak English; this is America,"' he said.\par \par \uc2 He's worked for a few years in Norcross in an information technology business. There, he said, his boss would threaten to charge him and his colleagues 25 cents every time they spoke Spanish to each other.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't take it badly," Casas said, adding it felt more like gentle prodding than a threat.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes he feels the sting of discrimination -- more when he's working his second job overseeing a construction business that he owns.\par \par \uc2 Casas, however, can empathize with some of the longtime Norcross residents.\par \par \uc2 He left the Norcrossarea because of the same problems that those who remain confront. "To be honest with you, the area doesn't look that good," he said. "Not to talk bad about my follow immigrants, but a lot of them didn't have the same mind-set that we have to make a home here."\par \par \uc2 Despite their burgeoning numbers, Hispanics aren't represented in top jobs on the Board of Education or County Commission. And that's made this area a target for Latino activists who filed a voting rights lawsuit last month alleging that district boundaries are drawn to minimize the voting power of Hispanics, blacks, and Asians. Blacks make up about 20 percent of Norcross's population.\par \par \uc2 Jose Perez tried to win office in 2010, seeking a seat that would represent Norcross on the County Commission -- he lost in part because of a whispering campaign that he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He was born in Cuba, but immigrated legally.\par \par \uc2 "That fear was there," he said. "I didn't do a good enough job introducing myself."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Some longtime residents have turned to state and county officials to change zoning and housing laws in a bid to preserve the old ways.\par \par \uc2 A leader in this effort is Faye McFarland, who cleans homes for a living and keeps a US flag flying near her front door.\par \par \uc2 The 70-year old recalled living in Germany when her husband was in the Army. None of the Germans catered to her wants and ways then, and she doesn't see why she's expected to do so now.\par \par \uc2 Her main complaint came when a Guatemalan family moved into a tiny ranch house next door. She said she counted 15 people living there. But what really set her off was that the family seemed to be running a siding and roofing business out of the home. About a dozen cars would be parked outside and supplies would be piled up, an eyesore in a residential neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 She felt like she was living next to a warehouse, and at night there would be work trucks parked on the lawn. Her new neighbors, she said, would simply pay fines for violating the zoning law but didn't change the way they were living.\par \par \uc2 "My quality of life was absolutely destroyed with all those folks and all of those vehicles," McFarland recalled.\par \par \uc2 She began going to City Council meetings. Armed with photographs and persistence, she'd make her case over and over. "We would put up the pictures and say, 'This is what I have to live beside,' " McFarland said.\par \par \uc2 The council finally passed an ordinance: Now only up to four cars can be parked on a driveway of a house in Norcross. Additional vehicles need a permit from the city.\par \par \uc2 Norcross Mayor Bucky Johnson said the ordinance has worked. "We had people parking all over the place," he said. "We don't have that situation anymore."\par \par \uc2 And McFarland's neighbors, perhaps tired of her calling various law and code enforcement agencies all the time, packed up and moved out.\par \par \uc2 "We have fought for this neighborhood," McFarland says. "We have really had to fight."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Fighting isn't what you want to do when you're pushing 80 years old. The Weathers family, who live across town, are more resigned to the changes in their neighborhood and don't feel they can do much.\par \par \uc2 They used to know everybody on Light Circle,their little cul-de-sac. Now they only know a few families; they call themselves the "holdouts."\par \par \uc2 "Every time somebody moves, most of the time, a foreigner bought their house," said Billy Weathers, 79.\par \par \uc2 That includes a home up the street from theirs, purchased by a Hispanic family. It's become a hub of sorts for an extended family that, to the Weathers's taste, pays insufficient respect to property lines. From time to time they've seen people picking berries from their muscadine vines without permission.\par \par \uc2 "I have no idea how many people are there," said JoAnn Weathers. "There's a bunch of them there."\par \par \uc2 She doesn't like the attitude she observes from the newcomers: "Sometimes it seems they come in demanding things instead of being grateful," she said.\par \par \uc2 Norcross changed its zoning laws to address concerns about crowding. Occupancy is limited to one person per 150 square feet of total floor space, and the county has a similar rule. But the Weathers don't call the police or code enforcement for these kinds of infractions -- they say it doesn't seem like the right thing to do.\par \par \uc2 Instead, they simmer privately with a sense of frustration and futility. "Our neighborhood and our little town is being run over by other people," said Billy Weathers. "You don't feel comfortable."\par \par \uc2 Both supported Trump in the primary and plan to vote for him in November; their grandson Seth has done some work for the candidate in the state.\par \par \uc2 They see Trump as an ally, but this support does comes with some reservations about the flamboyant businessman. "I fully believe that Trump can be a blessing," said JoAnn Weathers. "Scripture tells us to pray for those over us. We have to really pray hard. But it can work."\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 The changing complexion of the area has contributed to a shift in local job requirements too.\par \par \uc2 Take Deena Canfield. She's 55 years old. Single. White. She's lived around the area for her whole life. She moved back to Norcross from a neighboring county because it's inexpensive and she recently lost her job.\par \par \uc2 Canfield thought the largest hurdle she'd have to overcome in finding a new job was a felony conviction in the 1990s for stealing a rental car. Instead, she's encountering a different problem.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of employers are wanting you to be bilingual, which I find offensive," Canfield said. "This is America. Why do I need to speak a second language?"\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 But if you're running a business, and want to stay in business, change is necessary.\par \par \uc2 That's the attitude projected at the Howard Brothers, a grocery store turned hardware store that's been selling to the Norcross population for 61 years.\par \par \uc2 "I would say first of all the Howard family is a Christian family, I mean, a Christian business," said Andy Darnell, the store's head of marketing. "We have values that anybody should be treated the same. It doesn't matter who comes into our stores; we're there to serve them."\par \par \uc2 The older people know the business well, and the company likes to talk about customers it has had for three generations. "We had people who saw their dad buy a lawn mower from us," Darnell said.\par \par \uc2 Now Darnell is advertising on Spanish-speaking radio stations, and putting Spanish-speaking employees on the radio. To make these newer customers feel comfortable, they now make sure there's a Spanish-speaking salesperson at each of their five locations.\par \par \uc2 "That's really new to us," he said. "If we have to hire a cashier now we really think, 'We have to hire someone who can communicate on all levels.' "\par \par \uc2 It makes sense: Some of their biggest accounts at this point are Hispanic customers.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 The other option is to close down. That's what happened to the Dairy Queen on Buford Highway.\par \par \uc2 It was first established in 1968 by a longtime resident who sold it in 1983 to a group that included Raish Momin.\par \par \uc2 "We did a tremendous kind of business there; all Americans were living there," recalled Momin, who came here in an earlier wave of immigration from India and became a US citizen. On some Fridays more than 400 cars would pull up to the drive-through.\par \par \uc2 Then the neighborhood began changing. Koreans and Mexicans moved in. The Americans, as he called them, left.\par \par \uc2 "You could not see any customers who loved the Dairy Queen," Momin said.\par \par \uc2 Momin, 56, said he cried the day he sold the business in 2004.\par \par \uc2 But it proved a wise decision. The customer base continued to shrink. The new owner couldn't keep it going and finally shuttered the restaurant. It was knocked down.\par \par \uc2 Now all that's left of the old place is the sign along Buford Highway where a new business has sprung up -- a man selling coconuts for $4.\par \par \uc2 Annie Linskey can be reached at annie.linskey@globe.com.

[...]we're currently watching Trump, like those clownish cartoon figures of old, trying to escape the box he's built for himself.\par \par \uc2 These days, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  resembles a classic character from old cartoons: the bumbling do-it-yourselfer who has painted himself into a corner. After months on the stump, the GOP nominee now finds himself confined by his own rhetoric in a narrow Electoral College nook.\par \par \uc2 To put it in Trumpian terms, he's built a wall -- a wall that separates him from the voters he needs to win in November. And who's paying for it? Republicans are about to. And not just in their third successive presidential election loss, but in the critical political currency of Senate and House seats as well.\par \par \uc2 Thus we're currently watching Trump, like those clownish cartoon figures of old, trying to escape the box he's built for himself. His big move comes on Wednesday, when he'll apparently try to walk away from his round-them-all-up-and-send-them-back policy on illegal immigrants. Now, rational observers, be they some of Trump's Republican rivals or knowledgeable policy types, have long said it was neither realistic nor humane to deport everyone who is living in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 When Trump was appealing to the hard-core nativists in the Republican primaries, he regularly waved away those objections. But it's now obvious that that stand, which helped him win the GOP nomination, is a general-election liability. Although the response varies depending on how the question is asked, the idea of deporting every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is a clear loser. One of the narrowest splits came in May, when by a 50-44 percent margin, those surveyed by an ABC News/Washington Post poll said that illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay here. In a July CBS News/New York Times poll, 61 percent said the United States should let that population remain and apply for citizenship, with another 12 percent saying yes to staying but no to citizenship. Only 23 percent thought they should be required to leave.\par \par \uc2 No wonder then that Trump wants to wiggle his way back to the center. Still, it's stunning to see a candidate who for months called for deporting everyone living here illegally (and then letting "the good ones" return) now suggest that he would continue President Obama's approach, though "perhaps with a lot more energy." Yes, it's a step toward recognizing reality, but it also underscores the thoroughgoing cynicism of Trump's original "policy."\par \par \uc2 Of course, it's hardly the only ill-conceived plan Trump has modified, post-nomination, in the hope of making himself more electable. His proposed temporary ban on all Muslims, which was just as ridiculous and unworkable, seems to have morphed into a less overtly prejudicial ban on all immigration from countries that have a history of exporting terrorism.\par \par \uc2 He's also walked back parts of his tax-cutting plan. During the primary campaign, Trump proposed cutting the top income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. Fiscal experts soon pointed out that his proposal, taken in its entirety, would blow a huge -- as in $10 trillion over 10 years -- hole in federal finances. In August, Trump overhauled his plan so the top rate would be 33 percent, not 25 percent. A new TV ad, however, boasts about the supposed benefits of his previous plan. Confused? Well, so are the experts -- but they note that Trump's revised plan would still add trillions to the national debt.\par \par \uc2 Which brings us to Trump's signature pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexican border. It's another idea unlikely ever to come to pass. And one that 61 percent of Americans oppose, with only 36 percent in favor, according to a new national poll.\par \par \uc2 But it's one plan Trump simply can't abandon. If he did, it would reveal to even his most gullible supporters that he's been treating them like so many dupes and dopes. And that, at core, he's little more than a loud mouth and an empty suit.\par \par \uc2 Scot Lehigh can be reached at lehigh@globe.com.

[...]we're currently watching Trump, like those clownish cartoon figures of old, trying to escape the box he's built for himself.\par \par \uc2 These days, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  resembles a classic character from old cartoons: the bumbling do-it-yourselfer who has painted himself into a corner. After months on the stump, the GOP nominee now finds himself confined by his own rhetoric in a narrow Electoral College nook.\par \par \uc2 To put it in Trumpian terms, he's built a wall -- a wall that separates him from the voters he needs to win in November. And who's paying for it? Republicans are about to. And not just in their third successive presidential election loss, but in the critical political currency of Senate and House seats as well.\par \par \uc2 Thus we're currently watching Trump, like those clownish cartoon figures of old, trying to escape the box he's built for himself. His big move comes on Wednesday, when he'll apparently try to walk away from his round-them-all-up-and-send-them-back policy on illegal immigrants. Now, rational observers, be they some of Trump's Republican rivals or knowledgeable policy types, have long said it was neither realistic nor humane to deport everyone who is living in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 When Trump was appealing to the hard-core nativists in the Republican primaries, he regularly waved away those objections. But it's now obvious that that stand, which helped him win the GOP nomination, is a general-election liability. Although the response varies depending on how the question is asked, the idea of deporting every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is a clear loser. One of the narrowest splits came in May, when by a 50-44 percent margin, those surveyed by an ABC News/Washington Post poll said that illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay here. In a July CBS News/New York Times poll, 61 percent said the United States should let that population remain and apply for citizenship, with another 12 percent saying yes to staying but no to citizenship. Only 23 percent thought they should be required to leave.\par \par \uc2 No wonder then that Trump wants to wiggle his way back to the center. Still, it's stunning to see a candidate who for months called for deporting everyone living here illegally (and then letting "the good ones" return) now suggest that he would continue President Obama's approach, though "perhaps with a lot more energy." Yes, it's a step toward recognizing reality, but it also underscores the thoroughgoing cynicism of Trump's original "policy."\par \par \uc2 Of course, it's hardly the only ill-conceived plan Trump has modified, post-nomination, in the hope of making himself more electable. His proposed temporary ban on all Muslims, which was just as ridiculous and unworkable, seems to have morphed into a less overtly prejudicial ban on all immigration from countries that have a history of exporting terrorism.\par \par \uc2 He's also walked back parts of his tax-cutting plan. During the primary campaign, Trump proposed cutting the top income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. Fiscal experts soon pointed out that his proposal, taken in its entirety, would blow a huge -- as in $10 trillion over 10 years -- hole in federal finances. In August, Trump overhauled his plan so the top rate would be 33 percent, not 25 percent. A new TV ad, however, boasts about the supposed benefits of his previous plan. Confused? Well, so are the experts -- but they note that Trump's revised plan would still add trillions to the national debt.\par \par \uc2 Which brings us to Trump's signature pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexican border. It's another idea unlikely ever to come to pass. And one that 61 percent of Americans oppose, with only 36 percent in favor, according to a new national poll.\par \par \uc2 But it's one plan Trump simply can't abandon. If he did, it would reveal to even his most gullible supporters that he's been treating them like so many dupes and dopes. And that, at core, he's little more than a loud mouth and an empty suit.\par \par \uc2 Scot Lehigh can be reached at lehigh@globe.com.

Some believe illegal immigration is a human right. Entry into the United States is not a right; it is a privilege guided by law.\par \par \uc2 Today, we welcome legal immigration to Brockton. However, we cannot afford illegal immigration to drain our city of resources further. While US Census data put Brockton's population at around 95,000 residents, city officials tell me federal estimates put the figure at 30,000 higher when accounting for transient and illegal residents. That is a very large number of additional residents who drain resources at all levels of local government, especially our schools.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants help create overcrowded classrooms in a school system already inadequately funded by the Legislature. Furthermore, adopting the Brockton Trust Act would burden our local health care system and other social services. Illegal immigration costs the citizens of Brockton more than we can afford to pay and diminishes services from both those who migrated here legally and the city's natural-born citizens.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, illegal immigrants do commit crimes. This disrespect for the law can be seen every day, as highlighted in a June 4 \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2  article headlined "Criminal immigrants re-offend at higher rates than \uc2 ICE\uc2  has suggested." One tragic and horrifying example of such a crime was the case of Maria Avelina Palaguachi and her 2-year-old, who were allegedly murdered by Luis Guaman, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Guaman, who returned to his native Ecuador shortly after the murders, was convicted of the crimes by an Ecuadoran court in 2012 but has yet to face justice in this country.\par \par \uc2 The Trust Act for Brockton is a bad idea of monumental proportions and would further set back our efforts to revitalize our real estate values and improve our commercial tax base. We cannot condone the violation of immigration laws and continue as an economically viable city. I would strongly encourage all Brockton residents who are concerned with the direction of our city to contact their councilors and tell them no on Brockton's Trust Act.\par \par \uc2 As told to Globe correspondent John Laidler.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Today, we welcome legal immigration to Brockton. However, we cannot afford illegal immigration to drain our city of resources further. While census data put Brockton's population at around 95,000 residents, city officials tell me federal estimates put the figure at 30,000 higher when accounting for transient and illegal residents. That is a very large number of additional residents that drain resources at all levels of local government, especially our schools. Illegal immigrants help create overcrowded classrooms in a school system already inadequately funded by the Legislature. Furthermore, adopting the Brockton Trust Act will burden our local health care system and other social services. Illegal immigration costs the citizens of Brockton more than we can afford to pay and diminishes services from both those who migrated here legally and the city's natural-born citizens.\par \par \uc2 The Trust Act for Brockton is a bad idea of monumental proportions and will further set back our efforts to revitalize our real estate values and improve our commercial tax base. We cannot condone the violation of immigration laws and continue as an economically viable city. I would strongly encourage all Brockton residents who are concerned with the direction of our city to contact their councilors and tell them NO on Brockton's Trust Act, NO sanctuary city.\par \par \uc2 YES Lovern J. Gordon Founding president, Avon-based Love Life Now Foundation, which serves victims of domestic violence As an advocate against domestic violence, I am for the city of Brockton adopting the proposed Trust Act, which would strictly limit cooperation by Brockton police with immigration authorities. Many of the victims will never know that if they do seek help, they could obtain a special visa -- available since 2000 under the federal Violence Against Women Act, which enables battered women to apply for work permits and later for legal residency.\par \par \uc2 YES\par \par \uc2 Lovern J. Gordon\par \par \uc2 Founding president, Avon-based Love Life Now Foundation, which serves victims of domestic violence\par \par \uc2 As an advocate against domestic violence, I am for the city of Brockton adopting the proposed Trust Act, which would strictly limit cooperation by Brockton police with immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 Among other provisions, the ordinance would prevent police from arresting or detaining someone "solely on the basis of an immigration hold or administrative warrant," or from extending the custody of someone on that basis "unless a federal agent demonstrates a criminal warrant signed by a judge and based on probable cause."\par \par \uc2 Nearly one in three Massachusetts women has experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner, according to the \uc2 National Coalition Against Domestic Violence\uc2 . And many victims do not ever speak up or seek help out of fear. Being an undocumented immigrant adds an extra layer to that fear: the worry that if they seek help or report the abuse to the police, they might be deported. That added anxiety is something I have witnessed first hand among undocumented immigrants in Brockton through the work of my agency, most of whose services are provided in the city.\par \par \uc2 Abusers thrive on the power and control of their victims. Many immigrants who are here illegally are brought to this country with the promise of marriage (in order to become legal) but end up enduring abuse instead. The abuser will often threaten the victim that, should she attempt to talk to the police, he will inform them she is here illegally, and she will be deported. Victims continue to suffer in silence because if this.\par \par \uc2 The lack of trust of the police in these cases enables criminals to continue committing their acts of violence. Many of the victims will never know that if they do seek help, they could obtain a special visa -- available since 2000 under the federal Violence Against Women Act, which enables battered women to apply for work permits and later for legal residency.\par \par \uc2 You don't want victims being punished for seeking the help of law enforcement, and the Trust Act would help immensely in these cases. If the focus of police was on victims' safety, not their immigration status, many more cases would be reported.\par \par \uc2 NO\par \par \uc2 Craig Pina\par \par \uc2 Chairman, Brockton Ward 1 Republican Committee\par \par \uc2 Brockton is considering the possible adoption of a Trust Act by the City Council that would effectively make our community a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants. Some believe illegal immigration is a human right. Entry into the United States is not a right; it is a privilege guided by law.\par \par \uc2 Today, we welcome legal immigration to Brockton. However, we cannot afford illegal immigration to drain our city of resources further. While census data put Brockton's population at around 95,000 residents, city officials tell me federal estimates put the figure at 30,000 higher when accounting for transient and illegal residents. That is a very large number of additional residents that drain resources at all levels of local government, especially our schools. Illegal immigrants help create overcrowded classrooms in a school system already inadequately funded by the Legislature. Furthermore, adopting the Brockton Trust Act will burden our local health care system and other social services. Illegal immigration costs the citizens of Brockton more than we can afford to pay and diminishes services from both those who migrated here legally and the city's natural-born citizens.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, illegal immigrants do commit crimes. This disrespect for the law can be seen every day, as highlighted in a June 4 \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2  article headlined "Criminal immigrants re-offend at higher rates than \uc2 ICE\uc2  has suggested." One tragic and horrifying example of such a crime was the case of Maria Avelina Palaguachi and her 2-year-old, who were allegedly murdered by Luis Guaman, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Guaman, who returned to his native Ecuador shortly after the murders, was convicted of the crimes by an Ecuadoran court in 2012 but has yet to face justice in this country.\par \par \uc2 The Trust Act for Brockton is a bad idea of monumental proportions and will further set back our efforts to revitalize our real estate values and improve our commercial tax base. We cannot condone the violation of immigration laws and continue as an economically viable city. I would strongly encourage all Brockton residents who are concerned with the direction of our city to contact their councilors and tell them NO on Brockton's Trust Act, NO sanctuary city.\par \par \uc2 Last week's Argument: Should Plymouth raise the minimum age for buying tobacco products to 21?\par \par \uc2 Yes: 42 percent (5 votes)\par \par \uc2 No: 58 percent (7 votes)\par \par \uc2 As told to Globe correspondent John Laidler.

Cohen \par \uc2 762 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 July 2016\par \uc2 The Boston Globe\par \uc2 BSTNGB\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2016 The Boston Globe. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 As a writer, former speechwriter and occasional adjunct professor, I take charges of plagiarism more seriously than the next person. So the fairly clear evidence that Melania Trump's speech last night at the Republican National Convention lifted passages from a similar speech by \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  to the 2008 Democratic National Convention troubles me.\par \par \uc2 That Trump stole lines that dwelled on the notion of hard work and personal responsibility and came during a section of the speech in which she spoke of her husband's values made this particularly egregious. Looked at another way, there's a positive note: Melania Trump got a room full of Republican partisans to cheer something said by someone named Obama.\par \par \uc2 But any outrage I might feel is tempered by the fact that it took place on the first night of the \uc2 RNC\uc2 , which was a hate-filled, alternate reality presentation that should offend not just Democrats and independents, but also Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Here are just a few of the lowlights:\par \par \uc2 A convention speaker said that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  should be in prison and the convention crowd engaged in a prolonged chant of \u8220\'20\'1Clock her up" \u8211\'20\'13 a reference to the email scandal to which Clinton has been cleared of any legal wrongdoing. It's not often you see a political convention lustily cheer the idea of their political opponents being sent to prison, but here we are.\par \par \uc2 That same convention speaker, who tragically lost her son in Benghazi, delivered a speech in which she basically accused Clinton of being responsible for his death. That such charges have been repeatedly disproven by congressional investigators seemed to be of little concern to the \uc2 RNC\uc2 , which spent a healthy chunk of the night's proceedings peddling this fiction. Also of little concern was the horrifying spectacle of watching a broken and angry woman being exploited for narrow political gain.\par \par \uc2 This exploitation would be repeated later in the evening when an African-American man named Jamiel Shaw took the stage and recounted how an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  had killed his son. The Trump campaign has being using Shaw's story for months now to justify his xenophobic call for building a wall along the country's southern border and deporting millions of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 David Clark, an African-American sheriff from Milwaukee, Wisconsin celebrated the \u8220\'20\'1Cgood news" that the police officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray, which sparked last year's riots in Baltimore, were found not guilty. This was met with great applause, even though Sheriff Clark made no mention of the tragic and still-unexplained death of Freddie Gray.\par \par \uc2 Mike McCaul, a congressman from Texas and one of the few elected Republican officials to speak last night, used the examples of Fort Hood, Boston, Chattanooga, and Orlando to claim that the \u8220\'20\'1Cbattle is in the streets" against jihadist terrorism, even though far more Americans will be killed today in gun violence than were killed in those four attacks combined. Indeed, in the shadow of Quicken Loans Arena, a 2-year-old girl was shot in the head and is today fighting for her life in a Cleveland hospital. There was no mention of her plight Monday night.\par \par \uc2 Finally, there were the repeated efforts to present \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  as a salt-of-the-earth figure who is ready to be president. Scott Baio, or as he's better known to my generation, Chachi, said that Trump is running for president out of the goodness of his heart and because he believes in America. Later, Baio was asked in an interview if he had any regrets about tweeting out a picture of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  with a four-letter word used to describe a female body part that cannot be printed in a family newspaper. He had none.\par \par \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2  raged from the podium about global threats but then did an absurd pirouette, saying that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  loves all people, wants to unify America, and has been unfairly maligned by character attacks from the Clinton campaign.\par \par \uc2 And then Melania Trump attempted to round out her husband's strong values, his love of America and his commitment to this country. Oddly, she could not recount a single vivid example of his goodness.\par \par \uc2 When you put all that together it makes stealing a few lines from a speech seem not so bad.\par \par \uc2 Michael A. Cohen's column appears regularly in the Globe. Follow him on Twitter @speechboy71.\par \par \uc2 Caption:\par \par \uc2 Portions of Melania Trump's speech similar to 2008 \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  speech\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020161114ec7j00e4j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The new State Police policy targets criminals convicted of serious crimes such as violent felonies, drug dealing, and domestic abuse, or those who are threats to national security.\par \par \uc2 No police officer wants to see a dangerous criminal walk out of jail, not when there is a lawful reason to keep him off the street and possibly prevent injury to innocent people.\par \par \uc2 Yet until recently, that is what was expected of the State Police when dealing with violent criminals in this country illegally. If they arrested an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a lengthy criminal record, the defendant could possibly post bail and walk away.\par \par \uc2 The recent reversal of this ill-conceived policy returns common sense to the role of the State Police in providing reasonable assistance to the \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  (ICE) agency. The new State Police policy targets criminals convicted of serious crimes such as violent felonies, drug dealing, and domestic abuse, or those who are threats to national security.\par \par \uc2 Here's how it works. A trooper arrests an individual on new criminal charges. The investigation reveals the defendant has a serious criminal record or is a suspected threat to national security. The person is also in this country illegally and his criminal record makes him an \uc2 ICE\uc2  priority for lawful deportation. In that case, the State Police may hold the individual for 48 hours for \uc2 ICE\uc2  to enforce federal law.\par \par \uc2 The new policy clearly states, "Investigating and enforcing violations of federal immigration law is not a mission of the \uc2 Massachusetts State Police\uc2 ." The policy is neither directed at immigrants who are here legally, nor at illegal immigrants who otherwise obey the law.\par \par \uc2 The new policy does not allow a trooper to ask a person's immigration status in order to facilitate a transfer to \uc2 ICE\uc2 , nor does it authorize State Police to stop, arrest, or take into custody anyone on an \uc2 ICE\uc2  detainer list. Others may say it will prevent illegal immigrants from reporting crimes or acting as witnesses, but the new policy has been embraced by many communities and is recognized as a vast improvement.\par \par \uc2 This new policy allows State Police to keep our communities safer by taking violent and dangerous people off our streets. As a former police officer, I can tell you that's the reason we joined law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 As told to John Laidler.

Others may say it will prevent illegal immigrants from reporting crimes or acting as witnesses, but the new policy has been embraced by many communities and is recognized as a vast improvement.\par \par \uc2 At a time when at least six Massachusetts communities have passed local "Trust Acts" to prevent police from enforcing federal immigration law, Governor \uc2 Charlie Baker\uc2  initiated a policy for \uc2 Massachusetts State Police\uc2  to participate in the highly flawed federal Priority Enforcement Program. We should strongly urge him to reverse this action.\par \par \uc2 This program will break the trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement.

Connors Jr.\par \par \uc2 President & chief executive of Risk Management Advisors Inc., a Rockland-based corporate security consulting firm; former Lowell police officer\par \par \uc2 No police officer wants to see a dangerous criminal walk out of jail, not when there is a lawful reason to keep him off the street and possibly prevent injury to innocent people.\par \par \uc2 Yet, until recently, that is what was expected of the State Police when dealing with violent criminals in this country illegally. If they arrested an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a lengthy criminal record, the defendant could possibly post bail and walk away.\par \par \uc2 The recent reversal of this ill-conceived policy returns common sense to the role of the State Police in providing reasonable assistance to the \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  (ICE) agency. The new State Police policy targets criminals convicted of serious crimes such as violent felonies, drug dealing, and domestic abuse or who are threats to national security.\par \par \uc2 Here's how it works. A trooper arrests an individual on new criminal charges. The investigation reveals the defendant has a serious criminal record or is a suspected threat to national security. The person is also in this country illegally and his criminal record makes him an \uc2 ICE\uc2  priority for lawful deportation. In that case, the State Police may hold the individual for 48 hours for \uc2 ICE\uc2  to enforce federal law.\par \par \uc2 The new policy clearly states, "Investigating and enforcing violations of federal immigration law is not a mission of the \uc2 Massachusetts State Police\uc2 ." The policy is neither directed at immigrants who are here legally, nor at illegal immigrants who otherwise obey the law.\par \par \uc2 The new policy does not allow a trooper to ask a person's immigration status in order to facilitate a transfer to \uc2 ICE\uc2 , nor does it authorize State Police to stop, arrest, or take into custody anyone on an \uc2 ICE\uc2  detainer list. Others may say it will prevent illegal immigrants from reporting crimes or acting as witnesses, but the new policy has been embraced by many communities and is recognized as a vast improvement.\par \par \uc2 This new policy allows the State Police to keep our communities safer by taking violent and dangerous people off our streets. As a former police officer, I can tell you that's the reason we joined law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 NO\par \par \uc2 Tracie Gutierrez\par \par \uc2 Brockton resident, board member and office manager for Brockton Interfaith Community\par \par \uc2 At a time when at least six Massachusetts communities have passed local "Trust Acts" to prevent police from enforcing federal immigration law, Governor \uc2 Charlie Baker\uc2  initiated a policy for \uc2 Massachusetts State Police\uc2  to participate in the highly flawed federal Priority Enforcement Program. We should strongly urge him to reverse this action.\par \par \uc2 This program will break the trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement. While it is marketed to the public as a public safety tool -- ridding our communities of hardened criminals -- this is hardly the case. The Priority Enforcement Program is a complicated federal immigration initiative, and although the Baker administration highlighted it will only be targeting immigrants who pose a terror threat to the United States, that is what they want you to think.\par \par \uc2 In just one month, April 2015, two thirds of the nearly 8,000 people who had immigration detainers placed on them nationwide had never been convicted of a crime, and just 19 percent had a prior felony conviction. In Massachusetts, 40 percent of the 55 people detained that month had no prior criminal conviction.\par \par \uc2 With statistics like those, it is no wonder that people in the state's immigration community are deeply skeptical of any assurance that only serious criminal offenders or those at risk to national security will be detained under the governor's plan.\par \par \uc2 Cities and towns adopt local Trust Acts because of judgments by local officials about what is best for their communities, including how best to keep their residents safe. The Baker administration's new policy dispenses with these local judgments. It also returns our immigrant neighbors to living in fear.\par \par \uc2 The Priority Enforcement Program adds a new level of risk for immigrants who already live in the shadows as they struggle to take care of their families, raise their children, and work to make a better life. Many immigrants flee their countries because they are afraid for their lives only to come here and have to fear that at any moment their families may be torn apart.\par \par \uc2 To place a further strain on these families -- the vast majority of whom are law abiding -- is unconscionable and unworthy of our democracy.\par \par \uc2 Last week's Argument: Should Massachusetts support Quincy's bid to be declared the most patriotic city in America?\par \par \uc2 Yes: 81 percent (29 votes)\par \par \uc2 No: 19 percent (7 votes)\par \par \uc2 As told to John Laidler.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 [...]we do have statutes at the federal and state level that prohibit certain classes from being in possession of firearms," he says.\par \par \uc2 "Gun rights activists took issue with the selective editing on 'Under the Gun,"' the Hollywood Reporter wrote recently about Katie Couric getting caught fiddling with footage in her documentary that premiered last month on Epix.\par \par \uc2 Fair enough, except the term "selective editing" is an oxymoron. What is editing if not selection, a process of snipping, selecting, and putting together? Such manipulation is the essence of documentaries, news reporting, propaganda, commercials, and reality TV.\par \par \uc2 So what happens in the disputed segment?\par \par \uc2 Couric and nine unidentified people sit in a circle. She asks questions about their opinions about guns in America.\par \par \uc2 First question: "How many of you are carrying a gun right now?" Every hand goes up.\par \par \uc2 Then she asks, "If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?"\par \par \uc2 A montage shows the nine faces, one by one, silent, for eight seconds.\par \par \uc2 Some say it makes the nine look dumb. To me, they look like they're pondering their answers, which never come on camera.\par \par \uc2 As it turns out, one of those participating recorded the actual exchange. The recording was sent to the conservative website The Washington Free Beacon, where it was picked up by everyone.\par \par \uc2 You can hear it in its entirety at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://freebeacon.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://freebeacon.com}}}\uc2 . You can also listen to podcasts labeled "Bill Clinton would 'laugh until he cried' with stories of buying votes" and "Bill Clinton had flatulence issue as president."\par \par \uc2 Among the responses heard on audio, the most cogent comes from a lawyerly sounding gentleman.\par \par \uc2 "In fact we do have statutes at the federal and state level that prohibit certain classes from being in possession of firearms," he says. "If you're an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , if you're a convicted felon, if you've been adjudicated insane, these things are already illegal."\par \par \uc2 "Adjudicated." Sounds convincing.\par \par \uc2 Too bad Couric at this point had no follow-up question, like, "what about the 'gun show loophole'?" According to one of the film's experts, that's how 40 percent of guns get sold with no background check at all.\par \par \uc2 It also sounds like the answer that Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president and CEO of the National Rifle Association, offers to a similar question posed by Vermont Senator Pat Leahy in a \uc2 Senate Judiciary Committee\uc2  hearing shown later in the film. Except that Leahy brings up the "gun show loophole," and he demands an answer to his question.\par \par \uc2 There are no edited-in pauses in this exchange.\par \par \uc2 Leahy: "Should we have mandatory background checks at gun shows...?"\par \par \uc2 LaPierre: "If you're a dealer, that's already the law. If..."\par \par \uc2 Leahy: "That's not my question, Mr. LaPierre. I'm not trying to play games here. If you could, just answer my question."\par \par \uc2 And so he does, saying he does not think the law should be extended to "private sales between hobbyists and collectors," which are, of course, not the only transactions that take place at gun shows.\par \par \uc2 Couric could have done the same. She could have asked the right questions and let the answers come as they may. Instead, she relied on crude editing tricks that she says she regrets as being "misleading," and now that's all we talk about.\par \par \uc2 Peter Keough can be reached at petervkeough@gmail.com.\par \par \uc2 Credit: By Peter Keough Globe Correspondent\par \par \uc2 Caption: Controversy about the documentary "Under the Gun" (above) has focused on Katie Couric's editing of an interview in the film.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020161114ec6500ahp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Scott Leader, 38, and Steven Leader, 30 -- pleaded guilty to several felony charges in the unprovoked attack, including assault and battery, intimidation, and civil rights violations.\par \par \uc2 It was not enough for two South Boston brothers to urinate on a sleeping homeless man in August. They punched him repeatedly, and beat him with a metal pole. They called him a "wetback."\par \par \uc2 Then they high-fived each other and walked away.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the brothers -- Scott Leader, 38, and Steven Leader, 30 -- pleaded guilty to several felony charges in the unprovoked attack, including assault and battery, intimidation, and civil rights violations.\par \par \uc2 Scott Leader, who prosecutors said has a history of hate crimes against minorities, was sentenced to three years in state prison. Steven Leader was sentenced to at least two years behind bars.\par \par \uc2 Both sentences are followed by three years of probation.\par \par \uc2 The Dorchester attack drew national attention because of its random cruelty and explicit nature. Prosecutors said the men beat 58-year-old Guillermo Rodriguez because they thought he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Scott Leader told police the violence was acceptable because the victim was homeless and Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 "Donald Trump was right; all these illegals need to be deported," Scott Leader said after the attack, according to authorities.\par \par \uc2 In a mostly empty Boston courtroom, Suffolk Superior Court Justice Peter B. Krupp denounced the attack as "cowardly and despicable."\par \par \uc2 Suffolk County prosecutor Nicole Rimar said the incident "was an unprovoked attack on a sleeping man based completely off racial hostility."\par \par \uc2 Rimar asked Krupp to deliver a harsher sentence, citing Scott Leader's history of racially motivated assaults. He berated a Middle Eastern man after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and in 2005 harassed a group of Asian-Americans, Rimar said.\par \par \uc2 "The history of Scott Leader's attitudes towards others is troubling," Rimar said.\par \par \uc2 When the brothers were arrested, they said police only arrest white men and "never the minorities," and said the witness who reported the attack was "a rat," Rimar said.\par \par \uc2 Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said the unprovoked attack "disgusted every prosecutor, victim advocate, and trooper who worked on it."\par \par \uc2 Rodriguez, who was sleeping outside of a Dorchester MBTA stop when he was attacked, sustained broken ribs, fingers, and other injuries.\par \par \uc2 "I cannot understand why they did this to me," Rodriguez said in a statement. "I did not do anything to them and did not even know them."\par \par \uc2 He still feels pain throughout his body from the attack, he said.\par \par \uc2 "I have heard that they did this because of political rhetoric," Rodriguez said. "I came to this country many years ago and worked hard in the farm fields to provide produce to people here. I actually became a permanent resident of this country years ago although if I had been undocumented, I still would not have deserved to have been beaten in this way."\par \par \uc2 Krupp ordered that both men attend diversity and cultural sensitivity training when they are released from prison.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Trump has made illegal immigration a central focus of his presidential campaign and has pledged to build a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico.\par \par \uc2 It was not enough for two South Boston brothers to urinate on a sleeping homeless man in August. They punched him repeatedly, and beat him with a metal pole. They called him a "wetback."\par \par \uc2 Then they high-fived each other and walked away.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the brothers -- Scott Leader, 38, and Steven Leader, 30 -- pleaded guilty to several felony charges in the unprovoked attack, including assault and battery, intimidation, and civil rights violations.\par \par \uc2 Scott Leader, who prosecutors said has a history of hate crimes against minorities, was sentenced to three years in state prison. Steven Leader was sentenced to at least two years behind bars.\par \par \uc2 Both sentences are followed by three years of probation.\par \par \uc2 The Dorchester attack drew national attention because of its random cruelty and explicit nature. Prosecutors said the men beat 58-year-old Guillermo Rodriguez because they thought he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Scott Leader told police the violence was acceptable because the victim was homeless and Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 "Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported," Scott Leader said after the attack, according to authorities.\par \par \uc2 In a mostly empty Boston courtroom, Suffolk Superior Court Justice Peter B. Krupp denounced the attack as "cowardly and despicable."\par \par \uc2 Suffolk County prosecutor Nicole Rimar said the incident "was an unprovoked attack on a sleeping man based completely off racial hostility."\par \par \uc2 Rimar asked Krupp to deliver a harsher sentence, citing Scott Leader's history of racially motivated assaults. He berated a Middle Eastern man after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and in 2005 harassed a group of Asian-Americans, Rimar said.\par \par \uc2 "The history of Scott Leader's attitudes towards others is troubling," Rimar said.\par \par \uc2 When the brothers were arrested, they said police only arrest white men and "never the minorities," and said the witness who reported the attack was "a rat," Rimar said.\par \par \uc2 Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said the unprovoked attack "disgusted every prosecutor, victim advocate, and trooper who worked on it."\par \par \uc2 Rodriguez, who was sleeping outside of a Dorchester MBTA stop when he was attacked, sustained broken ribs, fingers, and other injuries.\par \par \uc2 "I cannot understand why they did this to me," Rodriguez said in a statement. "I did not do anything to them and did not even know them."\par \par \uc2 He still feels pain throughout his body from the attack, he said.\par \par \uc2 "I have heard that they did this because of political rhetoric," Rodriguez said. "I came to this country many years ago and worked hard in the farm fields to provide produce to people here. I actually became a permanent resident of this country years ago although if I had been undocumented, I still would not have deserved to have been beaten in this way."\par \par \uc2 Krupp ordered that both men attend diversity and cultural sensitivity training when they are released from prison. They must also perform 20 hours of community service.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys for the Leaders said the men regret the attack, but declined to comment further. Each of the men has a young daughter, and were active in their lives before their arrest.\par \par \uc2 Trump has made illegal immigration a central focus of his presidential campaign and has pledged to build a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico. He has made disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants that critics feared could incite a backlash.\par \par \uc2 When he was told of the assault in August, Trump said "it would be a shame . . . I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again."\par \par \uc2 Astead W.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The debate in Houston was one of the last opportunities for Trump's rivals to slow his momentum before Super Tuesday next week, when a sweep of the states would mean Trump would be nearly unstoppable in the march toward the Republican presidential nomination. From the opening minutes, Rubio -- who has emerged as the GOP establishment's favored candidate -- criticized Trump for hiring foreign workers to do maintenance on his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., something Trump said he had to do for seasonal work.\par \par \uc2 HOUSTON -- \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  unleashed a barrage of attacks on \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  in a debate Thursday, assailing the Republican front-runner with more gusto than anyone so far in the primary, slamming everything from his hiring practices to where his Trump-branded ties are made.\par \par \uc2 "If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  would be right now?" Rubio asked, with a sly smile. "Selling watches in Manhattan."\par \par \uc2 Trump responded with disdain.\par \par \uc2 "I'm the only one on this stage who's hired people!" Trump said. "You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards et cetera," he added, referring to issues Rubio has had with his personal finances. "You haven't hired one person, you liar."\par \par \uc2 Rubio was relentless, often talking over Trump and bringing up new lines of attack.\par \par \uc2 "Be quiet," Trump said during one exchange. "Just be quiet."\par \par \uc2 The debate in Houston was one of the last opportunities for Trump's rivals to slow his momentum before Super Tuesday next week, when a sweep of the states would mean Trump would be nearly unstoppable in the march toward the Republican presidential nomination. Not coincidentally, it was the most ferocious debate thus far.\par \par \uc2 From the opening minutes, Rubio -- who has emerged as the GOP establishment's favored candidate -- criticized Trump for hiring foreign workers to do maintenance on his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., something Trump said he had to do for seasonal work.\par \par \uc2 Eventually Ted Cruz also got into the fray.\par \par \uc2 "In 2013 when I was leading the fight against the 'Gang of Eight' amnesty bill, where was Donald?" he said. "He was firing Dennis Rodman on 'Celebrity Apprentice.' "\par \par \uc2 Cruz also criticized Trump for past donations he has made to Democrats, including some who worked on an immigration overhaul legislation.\par \par \uc2 "I got along with everybody," Trump said, before turning to Cruz. "You get along with nobody. . . . You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator, and you work with them. You should be ashamed of yourself."\par \par \uc2 "Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that's not a good attribute for a president," Cruz responded.\par \par \uc2 Trump at times seemed flummoxed, standing in the middle of aggressive candidates.\par \par \uc2 "I know you're embarrassed. I know you're embarrassed," he said, looking at Cruz and Rubio. "Keep fighting. Keep swinging, man. Swing for the fences."\par \par \uc2 The debate came amid intensifying concern among more moderate Republicans that Trump was on the verge of steamrolling to the nomination. Having won three of the first four contests, he also leads in many of the 12 states, including Massachusetts, that are set to vote on Super Tuesday. If his momentum is not halted by mid-March, he will be in position to amass enough delegates to put the nomination out of reach of his opponents.\par \par \uc2 On the subject of tax returns, which former Massachusetts governor \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  ignited this week by calling for public release of Trump's returns and asserting they may contain a "bombshell," Rubio and Cruz said they would release theirs as soon as Friday.\par \par \uc2 But Trump said he's been audited for "12 years in a row at least." He said that he is currently being audited for the "last four or five years" and that he would not release tax returns until the audits are complete. He gave no timetable.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed," Trump said, referring to Romney's 2012 campaign for president. "As far as my return, I want to file it except . . . I can't do it until the audit is finished."\par \par \uc2 With the debate ongoing, Romney tweeted there was "no legit reason [Trump] can't release returns while being audited, but if scared, release earlier returns no longer under audit."\par \par \uc2 The debate took place at the \uc2 University of Houston\uc2 , in Cruz's home state. Texas is the biggest prize on Super Tuesday, with 155 delegates at stake. Recent polls have showed a close race between Trump and Cruz, with Rubio a distant third.\par \par \uc2 In previous debates, Trump often has been able to float above the fray of the other candidates, who have largely focused on one another rather than attempting to take Trump down. But with a much smaller stage -- just five candidates remain -- Trump became the central figure.\par \par \uc2 Rubio came armed with an arsenal of attack lines.\par \par \uc2 "If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor to do it," Rubio said, directly urging debate viewers to \uc2 Google\uc2  "Polish workers" and "Trump."\par \par \uc2 "Such a cute sound bite," Trump sarcastically responded.\par \par \uc2 Rubio noted that Trump's line of suits and ties have been made in Mexico and China.\par \par \uc2 "You're going to be starting a trade war against your own ties and suits," Rubio said.\par \par \uc2 "You don't know anything about business," Trump responded. "You lose at everything you do."\par \par \uc2 That spurred Rubio to bring up Trump's business record, in which he took his company into bankruptcy four times. Then he brought up a lawsuit over his educational program. "A fake university!" Rubio said. "A fake university!"\par \par \uc2 Trump then chided Rubio's own record in real estate.\par \par \uc2 "Here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed," Trump said. "You tell me about this guy. This is what we're going to have as president."\par \par \uc2 Rubio also criticized Trump for lack of policy depth on health care and his unwillingness to provide details on what he would do after repealing President Obama's health care law. "What's your plan?" Rubio asked. "What's your plan?"\par \par \uc2 "It'll be a beautiful thing," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 Trump spoke over and over about eliminating "the lines around the states" to encourage more competition among insurance companies.\par \par \uc2 After he said it eight times over about a minute, Rubio, who was criticized for robotically delivering the same lines during a debate in New Hampshire, jumped in. "Now," he said, "he's repeating himself."\par \par \uc2 Cruz won the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. But he is coming off a dismal week, in which he finished third in South Carolina and was besieged by attacks from both Trump and Rubio, who called him a liar and a cheat.\par \par \uc2 The biggest problem for Rubio is he has yet to win a state. He is eager to establish himself as the main alternative to Trump, having narrowly beaten Cruz in both South Carolina and Nevada, and he desperately needs victories on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Hispanics are a rapidly growing portion of the American electorate and, polls show, are disenchanted by some of the hardline immigration positions taken by Republican candidates.\par \par \uc2 Trump mentions at almost every campaign stop that he would build a "beautiful" wall along the Mexican border and that the Mexican government would pay for it.\par \par \uc2 Trump was asked to respond to former Mexican president Vicente Fox, who recently said, "I'm not going to pay for that [expletive] wall! He should pay for it. He's got the money."\par \par \uc2 "The wall just got 10 feet taller. Believe me," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 Trump dismissed any notion that his hostile rhetoric about Hispanics would prevent the party from being about to expand its reach.\par \par \uc2 "We are building a new Republican Party: A lot of new people are coming in," Trump said. "I will do really well with Hispanics. I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party."\par \par \uc2 But Trump broke with Republicans midway through the debate, praising some of the programs offered by \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , an organization that many conservative loathe for its involvement in abortion.\par \par \uc2 "Millions and millions of women -- cervical cancer, breast cancer -- are helped by \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 ," Trump said. "I would defund it, because I'm pro-life. But millions of women are helped by \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Governor John Kasich of Ohio has faced some calls for him to end his campaign to make way for a consensus, anti-Trump candidate, but he has shown little appetite to leave the race before Ohio votes in a winner-take-all contest on March 15.\par \par \uc2 Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has has become a nonfactor.\par \par \uc2 "Can somebody attack me please?" he pleaded at another point, hoping for any way into the discussion.\par \par \uc2 Matt Viser can be reached at matt.viser@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Credit: By Matt Viser Globe Staff\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020161111ec2q00ac8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Along with New Hampshire, Trump has now triumphed in three of the first four contests. For those keeping score, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012 and \uc2 John McCain\uc2  in 2008 won two of the first four states.\par \par \uc2 Trump lacks big-name endorsements, is cursed by the conservative cognoscenti, and is at war with his party's leadership; everyone is against him, except the people. We've seen enough of the remaining candidates to know there are no Davids who can slay Trump's Goliath.\par \par \uc2 At Thursday night's \uc2 CNN\uc2  debate in Houston (it's the 10th, I checked), \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  and Ted Cruz fought to get back into the race, but their attacks against Trump were so chaotic it resembled a wedding dress sale at Filene's Basement. Hiring \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers, contributions to Democrats, the defunct Trump University, socialized medicine -- it was all flying elbows and arms.\par \par \uc2 In any other year, Trump would be damaged by his weak excuse for not releasing personal tax information ("I want to release my tax returns but I can't when I'm under an audit") but this is no ordinary political year.\par \par \uc2 Trump said once he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue in New York City and shoot someone and still he wouldn't lose any supporters. That wasn't just hubris talking. What he means is political movements are hard to stop.\par \par \uc2 Right now, there is no stronger force in Republican politics than outsiderism. Corrupt politicians, a broken immigration system, and inept policies have created perfect conditions for someone who bears no blame for the way things are to come in from the outside and fix things.\par \par \uc2 Nothing at the debate slowed Trump's progress. He has a nearly five-to-one lead in delegates over his closest rival, and every indication is he will add substantially to his delegate count on Super Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and her aides are said to be eager to face Trump. General election polling that shows her edging the New York businessman buoys them.

Along with New Hampshire, Trump has now triumphed in three of the first four contests. For those keeping score, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012 and \uc2 John McCain\uc2  in 2008 won two of the first four states.\par \par \uc2 Trump lacks big-name endorsements, is cursed by the conservative cognoscenti, and is at war with his party's leadership; everyone is against him, except the people. We've seen enough of the remaining candidates to know there are no Davids who can slay Trump's Goliath.\par \par \uc2 At Thursday night's \uc2 CNN\uc2  debate in Houston (it's the 10th, I checked), \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  and Ted Cruz fought to get back into the race, but their attacks against Trump were so chaotic it resembled a wedding dress sale at Filene's Basement. Hiring \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers, contributions to Democrats, the defunct Trump University, socialized medicine -- it was all flying elbows and arms.\par \par \uc2 In any other year, Trump would be damaged by his weak excuse for not releasing personal tax information ("I want to release my tax returns but I can't when I'm under an audit") but this is no ordinary political year.\par \par \uc2 Trump said once he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue in New York City and shoot someone and still he wouldn't lose any supporters. That wasn't just hubris talking. What he means is political movements are hard to stop.\par \par \uc2 Right now, there is no stronger force in Republican politics than outsiderism. Corrupt politicians, a broken immigration system, and inept policies have created perfect conditions for someone who bears no blame for the way things are to come in from the outside and fix things.\par \par \uc2 Nothing at the debate slowed Trump's progress. He has a nearly five-to-one lead in delegates over his closest rival, and every indication is he will add substantially to his delegate count on Super Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and her aides are said to be eager to face Trump. General election polling that shows her edging the New York businessman buoys them. But consider this: before he announced last June, a \uc2 Quinnipiac\uc2  national poll of the GOP race had Trump in eighth place, trailing Bush, Ben Carson, \uc2 Mike Huckabee\uc2 , Rubio, Scott Walker, \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  and Cruz.\par \par \uc2 Clinton should be careful what she wishes for; she just may get it.\par \par \uc2 Eric Fehrnstrom is a Republican political analyst, media strategist, and former senior adviser to former governor \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Credit: By Eric Fehrnstrom\par \par \uc2 Caption: The remaining GOP candidates for president.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020161111ec2q0095f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The debate in Houston was one of the last opportunities for Trump's rivals to slow his momentum before Super Tuesday next week, when a sweep of the states would mean Trump would be nearly unstoppable in the march toward the Republican presidential nomination. From the opening minutes, Rubio -- who has emerged as the GOP establishment's favored candidate -- criticized Trump for hiring foreign workers to do maintenance on his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., something Trump said he had to do for seasonal work.\par \par \uc2 HOUSTON -- \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  unleashed a barrage of attacks on \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  in a debate Thursday, assailing the Republican front-runner with more gusto than anyone so far in the primary, slamming everything from his hiring practices to where his Trump-branded ties are made.\par \par \uc2 "If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  would be right now?" Rubio asked, with a sly smile. "Selling watches in Manhattan."\par \par \uc2 Trump responded with disdain.\par \par \uc2 "I'm the only one on this stage who's hired people!" Trump said. "You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards et cetera," he added, referring to issues Rubio has had with his personal finances. "You haven't hired one person, you liar."\par \par \uc2 Rubio was relentless, often talking over Trump and bringing up new lines of attack.\par \par \uc2 "Be quiet," Trump said during one exchange. "Just be quiet."\par \par \uc2 The debate in Houston was one of the last opportunities for Trump's rivals to slow his momentum before Super Tuesday next week, when a sweep of the states would mean Trump would be nearly unstoppable in the march toward the Republican presidential nomination. Not coincidentally, it was the most ferocious debate thus far.\par \par \uc2 From the opening minutes, Rubio -- who has emerged as the GOP establishment's favored candidate -- criticized Trump for hiring foreign workers to do maintenance on his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., something Trump said he had to do for seasonal work.\par \par \uc2 Eventually Ted Cruz also got into the fray.\par \par \uc2 "In 2013 when I was leading the fight against the 'Gang of Eight' amnesty bill, where was Donald?" he said. "He was firing Dennis Rodman on 'Celebrity Apprentice.' "\par \par \uc2 Cruz also criticized Trump for past donations he has made to Democrats, including some who worked on an immigration overhaul legislation.\par \par \uc2 "I got along with everybody," Trump said, before turning to Cruz. "You get along with nobody. . . . You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator, and you work with them. You should be ashamed of yourself."\par \par \uc2 "Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that's not a good attribute for a president," Cruz responded.\par \par \uc2 Trump at times seemed flummoxed, standing in the middle of aggressive candidates.\par \par \uc2 "I know you're embarrassed. I know you're embarrassed," he said, looking at Cruz and Rubio. "Keep fighting. Keep swinging, man. Swing for the fences."\par \par \uc2 The debate came amid intensifying concern among more moderate Republicans that Trump was on the verge of steamrolling to the nomination. Having won three of the first four contests, he also leads in many of the 12 states, including Massachusetts, that are set to vote on Super Tuesday. If his momentum is not halted by mid-March, he will be in position to amass enough delegates to put the nomination out of reach of his opponents.\par \par \uc2 On the subject of tax returns, which former Massachusetts governor \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  ignited this week by calling for public release of Trump's returns and asserting they may contain a "bombshell," Rubio and Cruz said they would release theirs as soon as Friday.\par \par \uc2 But Trump said he's been audited for "12 years in a row at least." He said that he is currently being audited for the "last four or five years" and that he would not release tax returns until the audits are complete. He gave no timetable.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed," Trump said, referring to Romney's 2012 campaign for president. "As far as my return, I want to file it except . . . I can't do it until the audit is finished."\par \par \uc2 With the debate ongoing, Romney tweeted there was "no legit reason [Trump] can't release returns while being audited, but if scared, release earlier returns no longer under audit."\par \par \uc2 The debate took place at the \uc2 University of Houston\uc2 , in Cruz's home state. Texas is the biggest prize on Super Tuesday, with 155 delegates at stake. Recent polls have showed a close race between Trump and Cruz, with Rubio a distant third.\par \par \uc2 In previous debates, Trump often has been able to float above the fray of the other candidates, who have largely focused on one another rather than attempting to take Trump down. But with a much smaller stage -- just five candidates remain -- Trump became the central figure.\par \par \uc2 Rubio came armed with an arsenal of attack lines.\par \par \uc2 "If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor to do it," Rubio said, directly urging debate viewers to \uc2 Google\uc2  "Polish workers" and "Trump."\par \par \uc2 "Such a cute sound bite," Trump sarcastically responded.\par \par \uc2 Rubio noted that Trump's line of suits and ties have been made in Mexico and China.\par \par \uc2 "You're going to be starting a trade war against your own ties and suits," Rubio said.\par \par \uc2 "You don't know anything about business," Trump responded. "You lose at everything you do."\par \par \uc2 That spurred Rubio to bring up Trump's business record, in which he took his company into bankruptcy four times. Then he brought up a lawsuit over his educational program. "A fake university!" Rubio said. "A fake university!"\par \par \uc2 Trump then chided Rubio's own record in real estate.\par \par \uc2 "Here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed," Trump said. "You tell me about this guy. This is what we're going to have as president."\par \par \uc2 Rubio also criticized Trump for lack of policy depth on health care and his unwillingness to provide details on what he would do after repealing President Obama's health care law. "What's your plan?" Rubio asked. "What's your plan?"\par \par \uc2 "It'll be a beautiful thing," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 Trump spoke over and over about eliminating "the lines around the states" to encourage more competition among insurance companies.\par \par \uc2 After he said it eight times over about a minute, Rubio, who was criticized for robotically delivering the same lines during a debate in New Hampshire, jumped in. "Now," he said, "he's repeating himself."\par \par \uc2 Cruz won the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. But he is coming off a dismal week, in which he finished third in South Carolina and was besieged by attacks from both Trump and Rubio, who called him a liar and a cheat.\par \par \uc2 The biggest problem for Rubio is he has yet to win a state. He is eager to establish himself as the main alternative to Trump, having narrowly beaten Cruz in both South Carolina and Nevada, and he desperately needs victories on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Hispanics are a rapidly growing portion of the American electorate and, polls show, are disenchanted by some of the hardline immigration positions taken by Republican candidates.\par \par \uc2 Trump mentions at almost every campaign stop that he would build a "beautiful" wall along the Mexican border and that the Mexican government would pay for it.\par \par \uc2 Trump was asked to respond to former Mexican president Vicente Fox, who recently said, "I'm not going to pay for that [expletive] wall! He should pay for it. He's got the money."\par \par \uc2 "The wall just got 10 feet taller. Believe me," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 Trump dismissed any notion that his hostile rhetoric about Hispanics would prevent the party from being about to expand its reach.\par \par \uc2 "We are building a new Republican Party: A lot of new people are coming in," Trump said. "I will do really well with Hispanics. I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party."\par \par \uc2 But Trump broke with Republicans midway through the debate, praising some of the programs offered by \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , an organization that many conservative loathe for its involvement in abortion.\par \par \uc2 "Millions and millions of women -- cervical cancer, breast cancer -- are helped by \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 ," Trump said. "I would defund it, because I'm pro-life. But millions of women are helped by \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Governor John Kasich of Ohio has faced some calls for him to end his campaign to make way for a consensus, anti-Trump candidate, but he has shown little appetite to leave the race before Ohio votes in a winner-take-all contest on March 15.\par \par \uc2 Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has has become a nonfactor.\par \par \uc2 "Can somebody attack me please?" he pleaded at another point, hoping for any way into the discussion.\par \par \uc2 Matt Viser can be reached at matt.viser@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Credit: By Matt Viser Globe Staff\par \par \uc2 Caption: \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , and Ted Cruz during the Republican debate on Thursday in Houston.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020161111ec2p00aa1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama vowed last year to deport "felons, not families," but try telling that to Edvan Costa.\par \par \uc2 The church deacon and Stoughton homeowner has not been charged with any crimes since he arrived in the United States illegally 17 years ago, but he has spent the last month in immigration jail fighting deportation to Brazil. He is married and the father of a daughter who is a US citizen. He has lived and worked in Massachusetts nearly half his life.\par \par \uc2 "I'm kind of confused," said Costa, wearing arm and leg chains in a recent interview at Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Burlington office. "I'm a clean guy."\par \par \uc2 Contradictions abound in Obama's immigration policies, and advocates for immigrants say they are fueling distrust in communities such as Boston, Somerville, and Lawrence and other cities that are home to significant immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 "It seems like an agency that has a runaway agenda," said Jeffrey Rubin, a Boston immigration lawyer who was involved in Costa's case and represents a Lawrence man with no criminal record who is also detained. "And it is in complete contradiction to what the president of the United States wants."\par \par \uc2 In November, Homeland Security rolled out new policies to prioritize deporting criminals and recent border crossers over illegal immigrants who otherwise obey the law.\par \par \uc2 One of the president's policies -- to grant work permits to parents of US citizens and legal residents and older immigrants who arrived as children -- has been temporarily halted by a federal court.\par \par \uc2 But Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has insisted that the agency is still focusing on deporting criminals over families. In a column posted on the agency's blog last month, he wrote that immigration agents are focused on deporting "convicted criminals over undocumented immigrants who have been here for years."\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, ICE's Boston field office, headed by Sean Gallagher, rejected stays of deportation for Costa and Carlos Jordan, who arrived from El Salvador as a teen and is the father of a US citizen.\par \par \uc2 The Boston office, which covers New England, has also locked up Nicolau Oliveira Lima Jr., a 26-year-old citizen of Portugal who arrived legally in 2010 but stayed longer than he was allowed. He planned to marry his girlfriend Rose Anico, a US citizen, in Lawrence.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the men say none has criminal records and all would probably qualify for Obama's work-permit programs now pending in court. Lima could have applied for legal residency through Anico if they were allowed to marry.\par \par \uc2 Anico said Lima is already like a father to her 8-year-old daughter. "This makes no sense to me," she said.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials say they can't consider anyone's qualifications for Obama's work-permit programs because a court has halted them.\par \par \uc2 But lawyers say ICE still has the authority to set aside the deportations of longtime residents such as Costa, who was arrested on the day the Obama administration told federal appeals judges that people like him deserved to stay. Detaining immigrants costs over $120 per person per day, according to ICE.\par \par \uc2 "What side are these people on?" said Talia Barrales, a Boston immigration lawyer who represents Jordan. "Why are you even arguing for these programs when you're deporting people that would qualify for these programs?"\par \par \uc2 ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer said Costa is a priority for deportation because he was ordered deported after Jan. 1, 2014, the deadline outlined in one of the Homeland Security memos issued after the president's speech last year. Jordan also received a final deportation order this year, though he is not detained. ICE said Lima is a priority because he stayed longer than he was allowed.\par \par \uc2 Immigration lawyers, however, say the January 2014 deadline was aimed at recent border crossers, not longtime residents.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for immigrants say locking up noncriminals is damaging Homeland Security's credibility. The agency has urged cities and towns to help officials deport criminals, but over 300 communities across the United States -- including Boston, Somerville and, last week, Lawrence -- have limited police cooperation with ICE after the secretive agency targeted immigrants with little to no criminal records.\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement officials said relations with ICE are further strained by the agency's release of criminals in the United States.\par \par \uc2 ICE says it has to release criminals whose homelands won't take them back because the Supreme Court ruled it cannot jail foreigners indefinitely. But members of Congress have pointed out that federal officials could deny visas to officials from nations that refuse their citizens, which the Obama administration has not done.\par \par \uc2 Among the New England criminals released in recent years are a sex offender from Vietnam, a man with multiple drug convictions from Jamaica, and a man from Haiti with a violent record who stands accused of fatally stabbing a Connecticut woman in June, according to court records and law enforcement officials.\par \par \uc2 Barnstable Sheriff James Cummings, a Republican, said ICE recently declined to issue an immigration detainer for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Bulgaria arrested this summer for child pornography and for driving his car at a woman. If the man posts bail, Cummings said, he could go free. ICE has said they are monitoring the case.\par \par \uc2 "It just shows that the whole immigration system is a mess," said Cummings.\par \par \uc2 Because immigration arrests are secret, it is virtually impossible to verify who is detained and deported, although deportations overall are down.\par \par \uc2 Costa said he disclosed his arrest because he thought his pending deportation did not match the president's priorities. Now 36, he said he applied for legal residency after crossing the border illegally and was initially approved. He became a truck driver and the father of a 2-year-old girl. Costa's three siblings are US citizens.\par \par \uc2 He said he was placed in deportation proceedings after he returned from visiting his mother in Brazil; he said the government gave him permission to go.\par \par \uc2 "I do love this country," Costa said in an interview. "It gives you opportunity, more opportunity than my home country to have a better life."\par \par \uc2 After the Globe interview, his lawyer said Costa was whisked out of state, told he was getting deported, and then brought back to Boston.\par \par \uc2 As of Monday, Costa was still in Suffolk County jail, fighting to stay in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Maria Sacchetti can be reached at maria.sacchetti@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Caption: Edvan Costa, 36, is fighting deportation.Edvan Costa of Stoughton said he applied for legal residency after crossing the border illegally and was initially approved.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera said Wednesday that he will not veto a City Council ordinance to severely limit police cooperation with federal immigration officials, clearing the way for the new policy to take effect this month.\par \par \uc2 Rivera had opposed the measure as a risk to public safety. But he said the council, which voted 7-2 to pass the ordinance Tuesday night before a standing-room-only crowd in this city with a large immigrant population, had more than enough votes to override his veto.\par \par \uc2 "The message was clear for its support, and I will not stand in its way," Rivera wrote in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The new policy follows similar measures in Somerville, Boston, and hundreds of other cities and towns across the United States. The measure, called the Trust Ordinance, bars police from detaining anyone for \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  unless the federal agency has a criminal warrant for an arrest, which complicates deportation efforts because detainers are civil actions.\par \par \uc2 The Lawrence measure also prohibits ICE from using city facilities, databases, booking lists, or obtaining any information about individuals in custody without a criminal warrant.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday's vote followed hours of emotional debate in a council room packed with dozens of supporters in the city of 77,000, where most residents and elected officials are Latino. Councilors and others told stories of immigrants who came to Lawrence seeking a better life, but are forced to live in the shadows, afraid to call police for help for fear that they might be deported.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for immigrants were moved to tears by the overwhelming support on the council for immigrants, regardless of their legal status.\par \par \uc2 "It's making history," Patricia Montes, the executive director of the East Boston nonprofit, Centro Presente, said after the vote Tuesday. "This is the beginning. It's not the end."\par \par \uc2 Several residents expressed outrage over the ordinance. Two councilors, Roger Twomey and Marc Laplante, voted against the measure and a separate resolution urging the state Legislature to grant driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, which the City Council also passed 7-2 Tuesday night.\par \par \uc2 Twomey said the councilors were sworn to uphold the law, so they should not make allowances for people who have broken it.\par \par \uc2 "They are here illegally and they broke the law by doing so," he said.\par \par \uc2 But Kendrys Vasquez, a city councilor, said unauthorized immigrants should not have to live in fear if they work hard and otherwise follow the law. He recounted the story of one of his childhood friends, a bright student who couldn't get a driver's license or a college scholarship because his family overstayed their visas and were here illegally. His friend ended up getting a construction job and was later deported.\par \par \uc2 "What was his crime?" Vasquez said. "He was a good person, a hard- working person. Yet he was deported. We should start protecting those kids. . . . The city of Lawrence is their home."\par \par \uc2 Rivera, who is the city's second Latino mayor and whose older half-brother was deported years ago after falling into crime, did not attend the meeting.\par \par \uc2 But the mayor reaffirmed Wednesday that he supports deporting criminals, and expressed concern that the ordinance could stand in ICE's way.\par \par \uc2 "I can't support any effort that takes tools off the table for our police department that already has a tough enough time fighting crime in our city," Rivera said in the statement.\par \par \uc2 Just last month, police arrested two illegal immigrants in connection with the fatal shooting of a grandmother.\par \par \uc2 In June, police arrested an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who is allegedly a major player in heroin trafficking. He lived next door to Sandy Almonte, one of the city councilors who voted in favor of the Trust Ordinance on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Rivera said the Lawrence police already work well with immigrants, who make up 37 percent of the city. Lawrence is 74 percent Latino, a mix of native-born citizens and immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The mayor also said he supports legal status and even driver's licenses for unauthorized immigrants, as long as they are not criminals.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for immigrants say the more than 300 communities nationwide have passed similar "trust" measures are seeking to rebuild relationships with immigrants who might fear being deported if they call the police.\par \par \uc2 The policies gained ground after ICE used a crime-fighting program formerly known as Secure Communities to deport immigrants with minor or no criminal records, a policy that advocates said bred mistrust in immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 In November, federal officials renamed the Secure Communities program the Priority Enforcement Program, or PEP, to intensify the focus on criminals, but advocates say that is not enough.\par \par \uc2 These advocates say the Trust Ordinance does not prevent ICE from deporting criminals, because ICE still receives the fingerprints of everyone arrested by police under the retooled PEP program.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday night, some Lawrence residents expressed concern for public safety.\par \par \uc2 "Illegal is illegal," said Marilyn Mercier, a Lawrence resident wearing a scarf emblazoned with the US flag.\par \par \uc2 Rivera said the Trust Ordinance will take effect 10 days from the date he receives the approved measure.\par \par \uc2 Maria Sacchetti can be reached at msacchetti@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LONDONDERRY, N.H. -- In 2004, it was the Iraq War. In 2008 and 2012, it was the economy.\par \par \uc2 And as 2016 approaches, immigration has become the presidential race's most divisive issue in the GOP primary -- with ramifications that could extend until next November.\par \par \uc2 Well before \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's comments debasing Mexican immigrants and a San Francisco woman's death allegedly at the hands of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  earlier this month, voters peppered candidates with immigration questions in town hall meetings across the Granite State.\par \par \uc2 "Immigration has been a question in every event I have gone to for months and months," former Hewlett-Packard chief executive \uc2 Carly Fiorina\uc2  said in an interview during her five-day swing in New Hampshire last week.\par \par \uc2 The candidates' stances on immigration have become, for some GOP voters, a litmus test to determine whether a hopeful is conservative, moderate, or somewhere in between. Their positions often denote whether they stand with the traditional GOP stronghold of business -- which generally support a pathway to legal status for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants -- or with the populist base, who foremost want to secure the southern border.\par \par \uc2 And because immigration is one of the few issues that divide the GOP candidates, voters have been eager to discern their differences.\par \par \uc2 <!--empty b-->Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was asked about it during a Fourth of July parade in Merrimack. Last Monday, former New York governor \uc2 George Pataki\uc2  announced his immigration plan and challenged Trump to a one-on-one debate on it. On Tuesday, when Dr. Ben Carson addressed a bipartisan crowd in Manchester, the first voter question was on immigration. Later that night in the same city, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal took questions -- and two out of nine of them were on immigration.\par \par \uc2 "You hear politicians talking about it, but it is not getting done," Jindal said in an interview last week. "That is the reason I do think this is an enduring issue in this campaign."\par \par \uc2 The next day, former Texas governor Rick Perry released a three- minute video where he talked straight to the camera on his experience with the issue -- a direct retort to Trump.\par \par \uc2 The questions and speeches keep coming as the rate of apprehensions of illegal immigrants at the southern border has hovered near its lowest level in two decades, according to the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 . And while the estimated number of undocumented immigrants more than tripled from 1990 to 2007, reaching 12.2 million, researchers say this number has since dropped by a million.\par \par \uc2 And the issue extends beyond the campaign trail. In the latest University of New Hampshire poll, likely Republican voters said immigration was the third-most-important issue facing the country, behind the economy and foreign policy. That places immigration ahead of health care, the national debt, entitlement reform, gay marriage, or taxes as an issue Republicans say the next president must address.\par \par \uc2 "The immigration conversation is really important in the Republican race because it is the one issue in the top five issues where there are real differences," said Matt Batzel, the national executive director of American Majority, a group that trains Republican activists around the country.\par \par \uc2 What's more, having an unpopular position on immigration stings candidates. In February 2013, a UNH poll showed US Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida nearly topping the Republican field in the Granite State. Several months later, after he helped lead the charge on an immigration bill that would have created a path for illegal immigrants to work toward citizenship, his poll numbers nose-dived to seventh place. Even though he has walked away from his plan, Rubio has not recovered.\par \par \uc2 Trump, meanwhile, has seen his numbers soar in recent Republican primary polls. His recent comments that the Mexican government is "forcing . . . criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc." into the United States have garnered substantial attention. Nearly every other Republican in the field was forced to respond in the days following.\par \par \uc2 Bush, who wrote a book on immigration, once argued for an immigration law providing a pathway to citizenship, but he now favors a path to legal status. He spent more time explaining his position on the topic Wednesday evening in Hudson than on any other. At his town hall meeting, Bush mentioned he is married to a Mexican immigrant and made the pitch about immigration policy and electability.\par \par \uc2 "I want to win," Bush said. "To win, we better start figuring out ways to message our beliefs in a way that gives people hope that everybody will be included in the progress that comes."\par \par \uc2 Like Bush, several candidates favor some kind of way for illegal immigrants to gain citizenship or legal status, often with caveats - - such as several offered by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Some candidates haven't articulated a stance or changed it, including Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and New Jersey Governor \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 . The most conservative candidates on the issue -- such as Trump and Senator Ted Cruz -- repeatedly call for securing the border.\par \par \uc2 The tenor of the debate has intensified with the murder earlier this month of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco, with police identifying as the gunman a Mexican who had returned to the United States after being deported five times.\par \par \uc2 The issue has not resonated as profoundly with Democratic voters, however. In a recent UNH poll, New Hampshire Democrats didn't even place immigration among their top eight issues.\par \par \uc2 But immigration policy could still become the central issue in the general election.\par \par \uc2 Latinos voters constitute a key voting bloc in swing states such as Florida, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico. Virginia and North Carolina don't have as large of a Latino population, but these two states have become such a political battleground that every vote there has become precious. Those seven states were decided by 10 points or less in the last presidential election -- and in most cases, the margin was much closer.\par \par \uc2 Republican strategists worry Trump's unapologetic comments are hurting the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 . President George W. Bush was able to win the White House with 44 percent of the Latino vote. In the 2012 election, Republican nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  received just 27 percent of the Latino vote when he lost to President \uc2 Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Listening to Republican activists ask about immigration at dozens of events recently, former longtime New Hampshire state representative Kevin Waterhouse described the complicated root of the issue's surge.\par \par \uc2 "Unfortunately, I think there is a lot of this coming from a place where people feel like, 'I need to protect me and protect my job;' they perceive that there is somebody from somewhere who will do their job for less money," Waterhouse said. "For these people -- and I don't agree with them on this -- the immigration question is the jobs question and 'if you care about people like me' question and whether or not you are a conservative."\par \par \uc2 James Pindell\uc2  can be reached at James.Pindell@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- Federal agents prowling the streets here this week aren't always searching for international terrorists. Sometimes, they're hunting for Tom Bardy.\par \par \uc2 Around the valley that encompasses and surrounds Phoenix, agents have spent recent days swarming malls and markets in search of Gronkowsky jerseys and Partriots caps. Authorized to seize counterfeit goods on sight, agents uncovered about $100,000 worth of ersatz apparel here last weekend alone.\par \par \uc2 Gross misspellings of superstars' names are one of the things that give away the dubious duds. But more sophisticated fakes are indistinguishable from $300 authentic jerseys hanging in the \uc2 NFL\uc2  shop set up in the Phoenix Convention Center. And it can be hard to persuade fans that saving several hundred dollars on a set of matching number 12 jerseys for the family is a bad idea.\par \par \uc2 Contraband team gear is almost as old as fanhood. Before Super Bowl XX, in 1986, fans flaunted trucker hats featuring the old New England Patriot doing something unspeakable to a [Chicago] bear.\par \par \uc2 The profane debasing of a mascot -- and really anything that denigrates a team -- is guaranteed to be contraband, said Daniel Modricker, a spokesman for \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 . That "\uc2 Yankees\uc2  Suck" T-shirt you put on for special occasions? If it uses anything that looks like a team or league logo, it probably constitutes trademark infringement.\par \par \uc2 Although knockoffs are nothing new, the Internet has made selling fakes simpler in recent years. Official-looking websites sell gear of questionable quality to unsuspecting fans. And rather than trading in the cheap flea-market knockoffs that were once common, the products today offer only slight discounts over full retail price.\par \par \uc2 Wearing counterfeit clothes won't get you in trouble with the law -- customs agents won't take the shirt off your back. But officials say counterfeiting is far from a victimless crime. Aside from violating trademarks, the fake items often skirt sales tax and keep money from legitimate retailers.\par \par \uc2 At a news conference this week, officials unveiled piles of knock- offs seized here in recent days: Earrings of unknown provenance; a dia de los muertos style skull with a Patriots logo on its side; several flasks bearing the logos of different teams.\par \par \uc2 Clothes are common, said Sarah Saldana, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the other items can pose safety risks. Earrings and flasks made overseas on the cheap can include harmful metals. Such items are destroyed, while many of the seized clothes are shipped overseas to be given away in developing nations.\par \par \uc2 Those caught selling the goods usually face civil, not criminal charges. About 50 people were prosecuted criminally nationwide in a recent sweep.\par \par \uc2 Bogus tickets are more pernicious for those doing the purchasing.\par \par \uc2 Glendale police Chief \uc2 Debora Black\uc2  said some fans showed up at last week's Pro Bowl here with counterfeit tickets they had bought from a scammer. The \uc2 NFL\uc2 's version of an all-star game is widely derided and little-watched on television, but the event was sold out. Those with fakes were turned away. Though the value of watching the Pro Bowl is up for debate, the money spent on counterfeit tickets was very real.\par \par \uc2 Last Sunday's experience suggests fake tickets will turn up for Sunday's game, Black said. She and others urged those searching for last-minute seats to be wary. Real tickets have holograms on the back and a logo near the bottom that is cut all the way through each ticket. But some fakes are sophisticated, and some real tickets are stolen; those that have been reported stolen will not be accepted at the gate, either.\par \par \uc2 That's a nightmare for fans who came from far away and paid thousands of dollars to see the Super Bowl.\par \par \uc2 "It is not a victimless crime," said Saldana, citing counterfeit cases that include dangerous baby cribs and questionable military supplies.\par \par \uc2 Some wonder why the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency spends so much time and money hunting down fake luxury items when the department is also tasked with reining in illegal immigration -- a question Modricker said is the most common the agency receives.\par \par \uc2 About a week ago, an Arizona man who was free while awaiting deportation proceedings despite a burglary conviction and two harassment injunctions allegedly shot a convenience store clerk to death.\par \par \uc2 "We detain them very often, but very often we can't," said \uc2 Jeh Johnson\uc2 , secretary of the \uc2 US Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , who was asked about the case while visiting the Super Bowl site this week. Judges' decisions, legal precedent, and the long delays before deportations all contribute to the decision to release an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , he said.\par \par \uc2 Special Agent in Charge Matt Allen, who is coordinating security for the Super Bowl, said keeping contraband out of the country is a central part of the agency's mission.\par \par \uc2 "The majority of counterfeit goods are coming into the United States from elsewhere, primarily Asia," Allen said, which makes the knock-offs an issue for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , which oversees it.\par \par \uc2 Jerseys and merchandise are the tip of the artificial iceberg, Modricker said. Pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, electronics -- even car tires and airbags -- are routinely recovered by agents.\par \par \uc2 In addition to the obvious dangers posed by fake car parts, "That's money not being paid in taxes and not being reinvested into roads and schools," Modricker said, and the Super Bowl is a good chance to highlight the larger problem.\par \par \uc2 Nestor Ramos can be reached at nestor.ramos@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Caption: Homeland Security agent Gabriel Gonzalez displayed counterfeit goods at a news conference for the NFL Super Bowl XLIX game. Tickets with full security features were shownas well. US agents said wearing fake clothes does not mean trouble with the law, but such items hurt legitimate retailers. David J.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Representative Steve King has compared illegal immigrants to livestock. He tried last week to overthrow House Speaker \uc2 John Boehner\uc2  for being too moderate. And he was quick to defend a colleague who spoke before a white supremacist group in 2002, saying, "Jesus dined with tax collectors and sinners."\par \par \uc2 King could also play an important role in choosing the 2016 Republican nominee. A politician who delights Tea Party activists, riles liberals, and infuriates the Republican establishment, King is gathering outsized influence in presidential politics as a gatekeeper in the first caucus state, Iowa, and with a following that is attracting even moderates such as New Jersey Governor \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It puts him at the fulcrum of the continuing debate about the heart and soul of the Republican Party, as well as the potential perils of Iowa's role in the presidential nominating contest. He also illustrates the irresistible tug of conservative activists in the GOP primary -- because they have the most energy and can field ground troops and build excitement -- as well as the worries that the party will go too far in catering to them.\par \par \uc2 "He represents the conservative conscience in Iowa," said \uc2 Craig Robinson\uc2 , a former political director of the Iowa Republican Party who now runs the influential website the Iowa Republican. "For what the conservative activist is thinking and feeling in Iowa, Steve King is a reflection of that."\par \par \uc2 In two weeks, King will host a forum in Des Moines that will feature some of the top presidential hopefuls in what is billed as a kickoff to the state's yearlong evaluation of the presidential contenders.\par \par \uc2 Among those expected to attend the Iowa Freedom Summit, which is also hosted by Citizens United, are Christie, former governor of Arkansas \uc2 Mike Huckabee\uc2 , Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Governor Rick Perry of Texas, former senator \uc2 Rick Santorum\uc2 , and the neurologist- turned-conservative firebrand Ben Carson. Former House speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , developer and television personality Donald Trump, and former vice presidential nominee \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2  also are planning to attend.\par \par \uc2 "I'm very, very happy with the slate we have," King said in an interview. "I want to provide access for the candidates to the Iowa activists, and I want to provide access for the activists to the candidates."\par \par \uc2 But others in the party worry about King's influence, particularly at a time when some Republicans are trying to use more inclusive rhetoric and broaden their outreach to minorities. After \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  lost the 2012 presidential election, the Republican National Committee produced a report concluding that it needed to do far more to reach out to Hispanics, the fastest-growing segment of the electorate.\par \par \uc2 "I'm a strong advocate of immigration reform, and the Republican Party cannot have Steve King be its spokesman on this issue if it hopes to prosper," said Fergus Cullen, the former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. "Responsible people can disagree on the issue, but he's clearly a guy that likes to exploit it for political purpose and goes out of his way to use inflammatory rhetoric."\par \par \uc2 "Responsible candidates should find an excuse not to go there," he added. "I'm disappointed that \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  has accepted the invitation to go to this."\par \par \uc2 Christie supporters say that he could benefit by appealing to some of the conservative elements in the party, broadening his appeal beyond his more moderate base.\par \par \uc2 Christie also has a personal history with King. In 2009, when Christie was running for governor, he faced pointed questions during a congressional hearing about some of his actions as US attorney in New Jersey. King came to Christie's defense, and as his star has risen, Christie has held several fund-raisers for King.\par \par \uc2 "Christie and King have been friends for years, predating his time as governor, so he accepted the personal invite," said Mike DuHaime, who is Christie's top political adviser. "Christie has done events for King in 2010, 2012, and 2014, so doing an event for or with him is nothing new."\par \par \uc2 Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush is not planning to be there, citing a "scheduling conflict."\par \par \uc2 King said the criticism of him is overplayed and said the number of potential candidates coming to his forum is an indication that he isn't so radioactive.\par \par \uc2 "People in Iowa know me, they know my positions. And they're not concerned," he said.\par \par \uc2 King's power in the past has come through his events and his efforts to emphasize issues he cares about. He didn't endorse anyone in 2012, and in 2008, he backed third-place-finisher Fred Thompson. He says he hopes to endorse a candidate in 2016.\par \par \uc2 "I think King has always been more interested in advancing issues than a personality running for president," Robinson said. "The kingmaker tab is a little misleading."\par \par \uc2 For King, there is no issue more fundamental to the country than immigration. He has called illegal immigration both a "slow-motion holocaust" and "a slow-rolling, slow-motion terrorist attack on the United States."\par \par \uc2 In 2013, he compared illegal immigrants hoping to gain citizenship under the DREAM Act to drug mules.\par \par \uc2 "For everyone who's a valedictorian, there's another hundred out there who weigh 130 pounds -- and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert," he told the conservative site Newsmax.\par \par \uc2 The comments were denounced by prominent Republicans, including Boehner, but they also riled up conservative opposition to an immigration package that was passed by \uc2 the Senate\uc2  but never taken up by the House.\par \par \uc2 Still, Republican presidential candidates have sought to curry favor with King, sometimes awkwardly.\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  this summer sat down for dinner with King at a campaign event this summer when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  confronted King. Paul quickly got up from his seat, grabbed his drink, and left with his half-eaten hamburger still on the table.\par \par \uc2 King hung around, questioning the young woman on whether she knew English and telling her repeatedly that she and her mother had broken the law.\par \par \uc2 Someone in the background yelled, "Go home!"\par \par \uc2 King's rhetoric makes establishment Republicans, even in Iowa, cringe. Iowa has several prominent power brokers -- including newly elected Senator Joni Ernst and Governor Terry Branstad -- and some suggest that Iowa Republican activists are more pragmatic and less combustible than King.\par \par \uc2 "The presidential candidates ought to be careful to the extent they genuflect at that altar," said Doug Gross, a Des Moines lawyer, Republican consultant, and former gubernatorial nominee.\par \par \uc2 "It's not a ticket to win the general, clearly. It's not a ticket to win the nomination. And ultimately, it's not a ticket, in my opinion, to win Iowa. I don't know why they would do that, particularly a guy like Christie.\par \par \uc2 "The knock on moderates is that they're squishy," he added.\par \par \uc2 "The best thing a moderate can do is not show up at King's event."\par \par \uc2 Matt Viser can be reached at matt.viser@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Caption: Representative Steve King is gathering outsized influence in presidential politics as a gatekeeper in Iowa, the state that holds the nation's first caucuses.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Across Iowa this week, a casual observer could be forgiven for believing a presidential election is just around the corner.\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  of Kentucky just wrapped up a three-day, 10- stop tour of the state, a media throng in tow. Governor Rick Perry of Texas is about to embark on a four-day swing of the state, and four other would-be candidates are heading to a summit with Christian conservatives this weekend.\par \par \uc2 In New Hampshire? Cue the crickets.\par \par \uc2 Possible 2016 Republican candidates have spent nearly twice as much time in Iowa -- the first GOP caucus state -- as they have in New Hampshire, the first primary state and home of a more moderate Republican electorate.\par \par \uc2 By Saturday, Republican candidates will have scheduled a combined 51 days sampling the political winds in Iowa, compared with 27 days in New Hampshire, according to a tally kept by Democracy in Action, a nonpartisan website that tracks presidential campaign activity.\par \par \uc2 For a party trying to broaden its base -- and make an effort to appeal to minorities, gays, and independents -- some activists worry that a lopsided emphasis on the more conservative Midwestern state might be a sign of trouble.\par \par \uc2 At least, that is the argument in New Hampshire, which has often jostled with Iowa for bragging rights.\par \par \uc2 "By all means a candidate ought to go to Iowa and test the water," said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. "But sensible candidates are going to come to the conclusion that they don't have a chance to appeal to a broad electorate there."\par \par \uc2 "So you're going to have this sort of rump caucus that takes place there with a rump group of candidates," he added. "I just don't think the Iowa caucus electorate, on the Republican side, is representative of the party."\par \par \uc2 The rivalry between Iowa and New Hampshire, increasingly marked by a divide between moderates and conservatives, stretches back decades. The two states have not selected the same Republican candidate in a contested GOP nomination since 1976. Since then, Iowa picked the eventual party nomination winner three times, while New Hampshire elevated the eventual nominee five times.\par \par \uc2 During the 2012 campaign, 83 percent of Iowa caucus-goers identified themselves as "conservative," compared with 17 percent who said "moderate" or "liberal," according to polling of caucus- goers. The New Hampshire electorate was almost evenly split, according to exit polls, with 53 percent saying they were conservative and 47 percent saying they were moderate or liberal.\par \par \uc2 Iowa caucus-goers were also more likely to support the Tea Party, and almost 6 in 10 said they considered themselves evangelical Christians, which places more of an emphasis on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 Perry and four other potential presidential candidates -- Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, former senator \uc2 Rick Santorum\uc2  of Pennsylvania, and former governor \uc2 Mike Huckabee\uc2  of Arkansas -- planned to attend a summit of Christian conservatives on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone knows it's going to be a social conservative crowd and these candidates are going to have to address those issues early on - - in a way it forces these candidates to address these issues," said Craig Robinson, a former political director of the Iowa Republican Party who now runs the influential website the Iowa Republican.\par \par \uc2 "The biggest problem for mainstream Republicans is, what kind of event can you create to have candidates stay and discuss these things?" he added. "If you said, 'We're going to have a debt conference,' I don't know how many people would turn out for that."\par \par \uc2 The most obvious reason for the early emphasis on Iowa is that the current crop of candidates is more conservative. More moderate candidates -- such as former governor Jeb Bush of Florida, Governor \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey, or Senator Rob Portman of Ohio -- have been far less active in testing the presidential waters.\par \par \uc2 "The candidates who are most out front at the moment tend to be candidates on the right side of the ideological divide," said Tom Rath, a veteran New Hampshire Republican strategist. "And they would tend to find a more regular audience in Iowa."\par \par \uc2 There are perils to some of the early activity, such as a made- for-\uc2 YouTube\uc2  moment this week that highlighted the Republican Party's difficulty in talking about immigration -- an issue that also plagued \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's campaign.\par \par \uc2 During a campaign event in rural Iowa, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  confronted Representative Steve King, an ardent opponent of immigration reform, who was sitting down for dinner with Paul.\par \par \uc2 Seconds into the exchange, Paul got up from his seat, grabbed his drink, and left, his half-eaten hamburger still on the table.\par \par \uc2 King hung around, questioning the young woman on whether she knew English and telling her repeatedly that she and her mother had broken the law. Someone in the background yelled "Go home!"\par \par \uc2 Another potential trouble spot for the Iowa field: the party may once again hold its straw poll in about a year, which is an early test of strength and requires a strong campaign organization. Among Iowa Republicans, there is still debate about whether they will hold the straw poll next year, after it was criticized as a political sideshow.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, Representative \uc2 Michele Bachmann\uc2 , a Tea Party favorite, won the straw poll and former governor \uc2 Tim Pawlenty\uc2 , a more moderate politician who prided himself on his blue-collar roots, came in a disappointing third and immediately dropped out of the race.\par \par \uc2 The more conservative tilt of Iowa has caused some candidates in the past to skip it altogether. Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2  avoided the state almost completely in 2008, focusing all of his energy on winning the New Hampshire primary. Although Iowa breathed life into Huckabee's campaign that year, McCain won the nomination.\par \par \uc2 Romney placed a big bet on the state in 2008 -- spending $10 million, hiring a team of advisers, and catering to the conservative base -- only to come in a disappointing second. During his 2012 campaign he held the state at arm's length until just before the caucuses. He came in a narrow second, and then handily won the New Hampshire primary.\par \par \uc2 Activists in New Hampshire insist they do not feel neglected -- yet.\par \par \uc2 "We'll be on everybody's dance cards as of the 15th of November," Rath said. "In the end, we'll get plenty of attention."\par \par \uc2 Matt Viser can be reached at matt.viser@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020140808ea880002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A committee of Massachusetts lawmakers rejected a bill Monday that would have granted driver's licenses to illegal immi grants, leaving another crop of gubernatorial candidates to debate the hot- button issue before the November elections.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for immigrants had hoped the Joint Committee on Transportation, dominated by Democrats, would follow a recent national trend and approve the bill.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the panel voted overwhelmingly to send the measure to study, effectively killing hopes for its passage.\par \par \uc2 "It's a huge, huge disappointment," said Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, a statewide group. "Members are more worried about the safety of their seats than the safety of the residents of Massachusetts."\par \par \uc2 Of the 20 committee members, nine lawmakers voted to send the bill to study, another four opposed the measure, three voted in favor of it, and one abstained. Three lawmakers did not vote, said Heather Friedmann, research director for the Transportation Committee.\par \par \uc2 Representative William Straus, cochairman of the committee and a Democrat from Mattapoisett, did not respond to requests for comment Monday. He also declined to immediately release the names of lawmakers and how they voted.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, 11 states allow immigrants here illegally to obtain some form of driver's licenses, and eight of those, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, passed the measures over the past year, accord ing to the \uc2 National Immigration Law Center\uc2 , a Los Angeles nonprofit that tracks such legislation. Two New England states, Vermont and Connecticut, are among those that passed the measures.\par \par \uc2 In Massachusetts, Governor \uc2 Deval Patrick\uc2  has long supported driver's licenses for immigrants here illegally, but a bill has never materialized for him to sign.\par \par \uc2 In March, hundreds of people, mostly supporters, packed a State House hearing room saying the "Safe Driving Bill" would improve public safety by ensuring that all drivers are trained, tested, licensed, and insured.\par \par \uc2 State officials said the measure would also have generated nearly $15 million in state revenue through license fees and other charges, plus $7.5 million in renewal fees every five years.\par \par \uc2 But opponents said the bill would reward immigrants who broke the law. Critics have repeat edly pointed out that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Ecuador was driving drunk and without a license in 2011 when he struck and killed motorcyclist Matthew Denice in Milford.\par \par \uc2 Others predicted that the licenses would encourage illegal immigrants to stay permanently, and expressed skepticism that the measure would improve public safety.\par \par \uc2 "This bill will degrade the integrity of the Massachusetts license as a form of identification," Steve Kropper, cochairman of Massachusetts Citizens for Immigration Reform, said in an e-mail.\par \par \uc2 The last time a licensing bill advanced in the Legislature was in 2003, when it was voted out of committee, then faltered when Governor Mitt Romney, vowed to reject it.\par \par \uc2 With no resolution, driver's licenses have reemerged as a wedge issue in the gubernatorial race as Congress remains mired in debate over the nation's immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Among the Democrats running for governor, Treasurer \uc2 Steve Grossman\uc2  and former Medicare chief Donald Berwick lamented the bill's failure Monday.\par \par \uc2 "We need to embrace and help these people who live among us," Berwick said.\par \par \uc2 Grossman criticized rival \uc2 Martha Coakley\uc2 , the state attorney general, for waffling on the issue.\par \par \uc2 "This is overwhelmingly a public safety issue," Grossman said, adding, "I have a hard time understanding why the attor ney general, \uc2 Martha Coakley\uc2 , doesn't see this in the same way as I do."\par \par \uc2 Coakley said through a spokeswoman that she is open to licenses for immigrants, but stopped short of supporting them. She has opposed licenses for illegal immigrants in the past.\par \par \uc2 Republican Charlie Baker, who has long opposed licenses for illegal immigrants, said Congress should resolve the immigration issue.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's really hard for states to solve this on their own," Baker said.\par \par \uc2 The bills, sponsored by Senator Patricia Jehlen and Representative Tricia Farley-Bouvier, both Democrats, would waive the requirement that applicants for a driver's license present a Social Security number, the key barrier for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Massachusetts is home to 120,000 to 200,000 illegal immigrants, up to one-fifth of the nearly 1 million immigrants in the state, according to the Pew Research Center.\par \par \uc2 Maria Sacchetti can be reached at msacchetti@globe.com.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 With a production documentary clocking in at nearly 21/2 hours, "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" (2013) is a Blu-ray that you'd think would satiate fan cravings. True in some respects, but not all. The second installment in Suzanne Collins's dystopian saga again features Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, now a survival contest "victor" sensing the growing unrest in her world. Not much time to dwell on that, though, as Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are thrown back into the arena by the oppressive Capitol. The screen franchise continues to play as YA material that resists YA's occasional, distracting predilection for the uncool. We'll get elements like Amanda Plummer's genius-geek combatant ("Tick-tock!"), but we also get Jena Malone as an f-bombing ball of attitude shaking up the proceedings. Give credit to the film series' established template, but also to new director Francis Lawrence ("I Am Legend" -- no relation to Jennifer), who supplies commentary.\par \par \uc2  If only he and the cast had more to relate than standard lovefest interviews. Notable snippets: Producers discuss researching post- traumatic stress disorder to lend Katniss further texture. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman fleetingly anticipates his encore as games honcho Plutarch Heavensbee. (He'll be digitally rendered for some scenes in "Mockingjay" parts 1 and 2.) And right after edgy presence Sam Claflin acknowledges he wasn't a fan pick for games participant Finnick Odair, casting director Debra Zane gets atypically blunt. "I honestly don't care what the people who aren't hired to cast the movie think," the industry vet says adamantly. Fiery talk. (Lionsgate, $29.95; Blu-ray, $39.99; available Friday)\par \par \uc2 HISTORICAL DRAMA\par \par \uc2 12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013)\par \par \uc2 Wouldn't this be perfect timing: Director Steve McQueen's odds- on Oscar favorite wins best picture Sunday night, then gets an immediate victory-lap release on disc. McQueen and Chiwetel Ejiofor deliver unflinching, profoundly moving work with their portrait of Solomon Northup, a free black man in mid-19th-century America who's kidnapped and sold into slavery. A thought for supplementing the experience: Watch "Dirty Pretty Things" (2003), with Ejiofor as a Nigerian doctor pressed into a harshly different life as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in London. Or look back at McQueen's similarly challenging "Hunger" and "Shame," his prior collaborations with unhinged "12 Years" slave owner Michael Fassbender. (Fox, $29.98; Blu-ray, $39.99)\par \par \uc2 CRIME DRAMA\par \par \uc2 OLDBOY (2013)\par \par \uc2 Korean genre auteur Park Chan-wook's "Oldboy" (2003) is a taboo- trampling mindscrew that's impossible to unwatch. So this Americanized version from Spike Lee and Josh Brolin faces even bigger hurdles in persuading us to have a look than the usual remake does. Brolin plays a low-class businessman mysteriously imprisoned in a windowless motel room for 20 years, then released to go on a vengeance quest. Sharlto Copley ("Elysium") is his overly over-the- top tormentor. A few fresh narrative and stylistic twists, but again, once was also plenty. Extras: Featurettes include rehearsals for a spotlighted claw-hammer fight carried over from the original.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Dozens of new faces will join the Brockton Police Department's detective unit in coming days, part of a new, specialized task force assembled to help get a handle on crime.\par \par \uc2 The newcomers will not be Brockton officers, Acting Police Chief Robert Hayden said, but rather a phalanx of state and federal officers and agents, including those from the Plymouth district attorney's office and the \uc2 FBI\uc2 , working collaboratively with current officers in-house and on the street several days a week.\par \par \uc2 It is part of Mayor \uc2 Bill Carpenter\uc2 's sweeping anticrime initiative, his campaign promise, to get criminals off the street.\par \par \uc2 Hayden, 71, is a former Boston police commander, Lawrence police chief, and undersecretary of public safety for Massachusetts. He helped to design Carpenter's plan and came out of retirement last month to implement it.\par \par \uc2 Carpenter said he is impressed that Hayden was able to rally so many agencies so quickly.\par \par \uc2 "I think this shows the type of respect Bob Hayden commands now, and has gotten, throughout his 30-plus years in law enforcement," Carpenter said. "The relationships he has built throughout his career will be incredibly valuable for the city as we move forward."\par \par \uc2 Carpenter is hoping to get City Council support to name Hayden as a civilian police commissioner in the coming days. If the answer is yes, he would serve for a year and help choose Brockton's new chief.\par \par \uc2 The job Carpenter is working to create is a one-shot deal that sunsets after 12 months. In that time, if Hayden is appointed, he is expected to make a big dent in crime and to boost both the city's image and morale among the department's officers, the mayor said.\par \par \uc2 Councilor Thomas Monahan of Ward 2 said that he is all for trying new strategies, but that it will not alter the city's core issue for policing.\par \par \uc2 "I think the biggest problem is the lack of men," he said. "We need to get more police on the job, and that takes money. When this state continues to give less and less, especially to old manufacturing cities like Brockton, it makes it harder to have fully staffed police, fire, and other departments."\par \par \uc2 Brockton's 95,000 residents are safer than those in only 12 percent of the nation's other cities, accord ing to Neighborhood Scout, a website with national crime statistics from the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and the US Census.\par \par \uc2 Boston, by comparison, is safer than 15 percent of other US cities, Quincy is safer than 42 percent of them, and Duxbury is safer than 90 percent of the country's other communities, according to the website.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, the most recent year for which figures are available, Brockton reported six homi cides, 48 rapes, 225 robberies, and 809 assaults, accord ing to the site.\par \par \uc2 However, said Hayden, "I don't look at crime rates."\par \par \uc2 He said he judges a department's work by how safe people appear to feel in their own homes and neighborhoods.\par \par \uc2 "After I'm here for a month, I'll either get a good feeling or I won't," he said. "If I see a mother and father outside pushing a baby carriage down the street, I'll know I'm doing something good."\par \par \uc2 Members of the new task force, who will be paid by their own agencies, will answer to Brockton police Lieutenants Paul Bonanca and Kenny LeGice, Hayden said. The task force includes representatives from the Plymouth County Sheriff's Department and district attorney's office; the MBTA; State Police; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the Secret Service; Immigration and Customs Enforcement; the Department of Homeland Security; and the \uc2 FBI\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some members have stepped in at one time or another to assist Brockton's 200-member department, Hayden said. "But it was a fragmented partnership, where one group didn't know what the other was doing," he said. Cohesion was missing.\par \par \uc2 Now, the group will work "shoulder to shoulder," he said, and its members will try to eliminate turf issues "so that it won't matter who contributes to an arrest."\par \par \uc2 First on the agenda is an effort to target gangs, drugs, and criminal activity in the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  community, Hayden said.\par \par \uc2 While the task force is focused on that, a new motor cycle patrol will roll out citywide, he said. Small patrols led by a supervisor and followed by a wagon, if arrests are necessary, will offer a high-profile police presence, but will not act like an "occupying army," Hayden said; the operation will be well organized and in control, and use the "broken windows" approach.\par \par \uc2 "There is a saying that if you take care of the little things, [like broken windows], the other things take care of themselves," he said. "Once we show the bullies we are aware of them, things will start to get better."\par \par \uc2 Police will definitely be looking for people, Hayden said. "But they will only be arrested if they have committed a crime."\par \par \uc2 Michele Morgan Bolton can be reached at michelebolton@ live.com.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020140220ea2k0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A husband and wife from the town of Harvard pleaded guilty in federal court in Boston Wednesday to charges they paid an immigrant they helped bring into the country illegally less than $3,000 for the 13 years she cooked, cleaned, cared for their children, and even shoveled snow for them, according to court records.\par \par \uc2 Martha Smalanskas, 48, and Richard Smalanskas, 49, the parents of three children, will serve a year of probation and pay the victim $150,000 in restitution, under an agreement they reached with prosecutors. A charge of harboring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , which carries a punishment of up to 10 years in prison, will be dismissed.\par \par \uc2 The couple will be sentenced April 2 after pleading guilty to charges of violating the Fair Labor Standards Act.\par \par \uc2 Assistant US Attorney Thomas E. Kanwit told US District Court Judge Rya W. Zobel Wednesday that prosecutors sought restitution rather than jail so the victim, whom the couple hired when she was 16, could benefit from the money.\par \par \uc2 "They brought her into the United States to work," he said.\par \par \uc2 Authorities determined that the couple hired the nanny when she 16, when the couple lived in Bolivia. After three years, they brought her to the United States and helped her get false documentation to make it appear as if she was related to them.\par \par \uc2 Once here, they took her travel documents away, and she was required to work long hours: From 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. six days a week, although she was allowed to leave early some Saturdays. She had Sundays off.\par \par \uc2 During that time, they promised her $100 a month, though they increased the promise to $150 a month in the last years she worked for them, and still they did not pay that, according to court records. Prosecutors determined that at times the family paid her as little as $35 a month.\par \par \uc2 Kanwit said authorities determined that the Smalanskas family owed the victim roughly $301,000, after accounting for room and board, under the prevailing minimum wage. Instead, she got about $2,500.\par \par \uc2 "That would be for the entire 13 years and four months" she worked, from 1997 to 2011, he said.\par \par \uc2 The victim was removed from the home for unknown reasons in May 2011.\par \par \uc2 Milton J.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The number of immigrants jailed for deportation in New England plunged last year, despite federal immigration officials' expansion of a controversial program designed to catch illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 While jailings nationally dipped less than 8 percent, federal officials said that in New England they dropped almost 28 percent. A total of 3,644 immigrants were jailed last fiscal year in this region, down from 5,042 the year before.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials say the figures here and nationwide reflect an effort to focus specifically on deporting recent border crossers and immigrants with criminal records, a narrower subset of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for immigrants hailed the shift and are pressing officials to release even more immigrants from jail. But others say that the shift is perplexing because the federal government dramatically expanded the Secure Communities fingerprinting program last year in New England, increasing its ability to detect immigrants here illegally. Some say the expansion was expected to lead to more jailings, not fewer.\par \par \uc2 One theory is that in New England, and especially in Massachusetts, immigration officials are under pressure to lessen enforcement. "You're seeing less enforcement and that's part of the problem," said Bristol County Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson, who has seen the number of immigrant detainees at his North Dartmouth jail decline from 200 a day to as low as 150 a day. "We've become kind of a sanctuary state."\par \par \uc2 Enforcement is expected to be a major sticking point next year if Congress takes another crack at overhauling the nation's immigration laws. President Obama favors a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants here illegally, including about 160,000 in Massachusetts, according to the Pew Research Center. But critics say failing to enforce immigration law across the United States, and not just on the border, could endanger support for any legislation.\par \par \uc2 A senior Obama administration official said on Friday that federal officials are enforcing the law, but in a targeted way that ensures that the most serious offenders are deported. Last fiscal year, federal officials deported 368,644 people, a 10 percent drop from the previous year, but 59 percent of those deported had a criminal record, an increase from prior years.\par \par \uc2 Some 82 percent of those deported from interior states such as Massachusetts had been convicted of a crime. "We've been very clear since 2009 that our focus was going to be on border security and public safety," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\par \par \uc2 Others cautioned that there are other possible explanations for the drop in detentions in New England. Some immigrants may have been moved from Massachusetts and other states to larger immigration jails in Texas or Georgia before being deported. Others might still be facing deportation even if they are not in jail.\par \par \uc2 And thousands of immigrants are in the midst of deportation proceedings in Boston's immigration court, which is so clogged that some judges are scheduling deportation hearings into 2018.\par \par \uc2 "It seems that immigration court is busier than ever," said Matthew J. Maiona, a Boston immigration lawyer.\par \par \uc2 Because the federal immigration system is largely secret, it is impossible to identify the immigrants who were deported, track their court cases, or verify their criminal history.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for immigrants also remained skeptical of the administration's detention and deportation figures, and have continued to call for the release of even more immigrant detainees. They say the continued deportations are separating parents from their US-born children and creating unnecessary fear as Congress works toward a possible solution for those here illegally. In recent weeks, activists have blockaded immigration jails in New Jersey, California, and Virginia in an attempt to halt deportations. In Massachusetts this year, detainees staged a hunger strike at the Suffolk County jail, which contracts with \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  to house detainees.\par \par \uc2 "No one who's undocumented should be put in prison like that. That's crazy," said Peter Lowber, a member of the steering committee of the New Sanctuary Movement, a group in Greater Boston that advocates for immigrants and has rallied at Suffolk. "I'm glad the numbers are down. It's outrageous."\par \par \uc2 But others said the latest statistics suggest that enforcement is weak. "Enforcement is right now about as bare bones as it can get," said \uc2 Jessica Vaughan\uc2 , director of policy studies for the \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2 , a Washington-based organization that favors tougher limits on immigration. "It's a problem for communities because that's more people who are going to keep trying to come here illegally and settle here illegally. It's more job opportunities lost for Americans and legal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 She said the decline was especially confusing in Massachusetts, where federal immigration officials expanded the controversial Secure Communities program from Boston to the rest of the state in May 2012. The program automatically checks the fingerprints of everyone arrested by state and local police against immigration databases to identify immigrants subject to deportation.\par \par \uc2 The Patrick administration opposed the expansion, pointing out that Secure Communities has ensnared many immigrants who have never been convicted of a crime, and Boston's mayor-elect, Martin J. Walsh, has said he would withdraw Boston from the program, if he could. Federal officials have said the program is mandatory.\par \par \uc2 Maria Sacchetti can be reached at msacchetti@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Police suspect foul play in the death of a Revere woman in her 40s who collapsed on a Chelsea street early Tuesday and later succumbed to her injuries at a Boston hospital.\par \par \uc2 Chelsea officers found the woman lying on Broadway near Congress Avenue just after 1 a.m., Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley's office and city police said in a joint statement. Witnesses saw her walking from the direction of Everett Avenue when she fell.\par \par \uc2 The woman had suffered serious injuries and later died at \uc2 Massachusetts General Hospital\uc2 , the statement said.\par \par \uc2 Jake Wark, a spokesman for Conley, would not discuss the woman's injuries, citing a "sensitive period in the investigation." A Chelsea police spokesman could not be reached for comment. Officials withheld the woman's name, pending family notification.\par \par \uc2 The medical examiner had not determined an official cause of death Tuesday, but police were treating the case as a homicide, officials said. Asked if there were any suspects, Wark said only that no charges had been brought.\par \par \uc2 He said police were investigating whether the woman knew her assailant. It was not immediately clear where she was attacked.\par \par \uc2 "At this stage, the investigation is quite squarely within Chelsea," Wark said.\par \par \uc2 The city had recorded four homicides this year prior to Tuesday, according to police statistics, and arrests were made in all of them. Chelsea had 11 murders in 2010, none in 2011, and two last year.\par \par \uc2 In July, Hilda Devincenzo, 88, was strangled and beaten to death inside the three-family home she owned on Washington Avenue. Felix Melendez, her alleged killer and a former tenant in the building, is also accused of stealing her wedding and engagement rings.\par \par \uc2 Melendez pleaded not guilty to the charges in October.\par \par \uc2 Devincenzo's slaying followed the double murder in May of Zouaoui Dani-Elkebir, 52, and Karima El-Hakim, 38, both of Everett. They were fatally shot in a taxicab that jumped the curb on Crescent Avenue. Maurice Morrison, 28, of Chelsea, has pleaded not guilty in the shootings.\par \par \uc2 The city's first homicide of the year came in March, when Elder A. Morales, 21, was shot on Blossom Street in the chest and back of the head.\par \par \uc2 The accused triggerman, Manuel Castro, 23, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, identified himself as an 18th Street gang member and told police that Morales belonged to the rival MS-13, a violent gang that sprang up in Los Angeles in the 1980s, according to prosecutors. Castro has pleaded not guilty.\par \par \uc2 Anyone with information on the Revere woman's death is aksed to call Chelsea detectives at 617-466-4843. Tipsters who wish to remain anonymous can call a separate department line at 617-466-4880, or text the word CHELSEA and their information to TIP411 [847411].\par \par \uc2 Travis Andersen can be reached at travis.andersen@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Mayor-elect Martin J. Walsh said Tuesday that he wants Boston to pull out of a controversial federal initiative designed to identify illegal immigrants because he believes too many people are detained for nonviolent offenses.\par \par \uc2 The Secure Communities program allows the Department of Homeland Security to access fingerprints taken by local police, which federal officials can check against federal immigration databases. Those who are in the country illegally can then be deported.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether he would continue to enforce the program as mayor, Walsh responded: "If we can get around it, I won't."\par \par \uc2 "People that are getting pulled over -- I don't think that, necessarily, we have to bring in immigration for that," Walsh told reporters at a Thanksgiving dinner for immigrants at the State House.\par \par \uc2 The federal government says it prioritizes for deportation those who pose the greatest threat to public safety, based on their criminal histories. But a Globe analysis this year suggested that federal immigration officials are deporting more immigrants in Massachusetts for civil violations than for serious crimes under the program.\par \par \uc2 Walsh's opposition to Secure Communities represents something of a shift from Mayor Thomas M. Menino's stance. Under Menino, Boston piloted Secure Communities in 2006, and the program was expanded nationally in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Several hours after Walsh made his remarks, his spokeswoman, Kathryn Norton, acknowledged that the mayor-elect would not have the authority to end Boston's participation in the program, because it is a mandatory federal initiative.\par \par \uc2 "As we understand it, there's no authority to opt out," Norton said. "Honestly, it remains to be seen what we're able to do in the role of mayor of Boston."\par \par \uc2 Last year, officials expanded the program in Massachusetts, despite strong opposition from Governor \uc2 Deval Patrick\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  agency disputed Walsh's assertion that Secure Communities targets illegal immigrants arrested for nonviolent offenses.\par \par \uc2 Gillian M. Christensen, an agency spokeswoman, said federal officials focus on "priority individuals such as convicted criminals and other public safety threats, as well as those who repeatedly violate our immigration laws."\par \par \uc2 "The federal government alone sets these priorities and places detainers on individuals arrested on criminal charges to ensure that dangerous criminal aliens and other priority individuals are not released from prisons and jails into our communities," she said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Walsh, the son of Irish immigrants, said that if he cannot end Boston's participation in Secure Communities, he would seek to "soften" its impact by pushing for state legislation that would limit Massachusetts' participation in the program.\par \par \uc2 Walsh said he supports a bill known as the Trust Act that would allow local police to ignore requests from federal immigration officials to detain illegal immigrants, unless those immigrants have committed major crimes.\par \par \uc2 "Law enforcement, in particular, needs to be able to build relationships of trust with immigrant communities, and they can't do that with the fear of deportation hanging over the relationship," Norton said.\par \par \uc2 Versions of the bill have been enacted recently in California and Connecticut.\par \par \uc2 Although immigration was not a major focus of Walsh's campaign for mayor, his remarks on Tuesday were not the first time he has spoken out on the issue.\par \par \uc2 As a state representative in 2006, he voted for a bill that would have granted in-state tuition rates at public colleges to illegal immigrants who graduated from Massachusetts high schools. "He's always been supportive of immigrants, including undocumented immigrants," said state Senator James B. Eldridge, an Acton Democrat, and lead sponsor of the Trust Act.\par \par \uc2 Menino's position on Secure Communities has shifted. Initially, he and other city officials strongly defended the program, saying it could help reduce crime in a city that has struggled with gun violence.\par \par \uc2 Then, in an abrupt reversal in 2011, Menino threatened to withdraw Boston from the program unless federal officials limited their deportation efforts to only those immigrants who committed serious crimes.\par \par \uc2 "The way it was written does not serve local law enforcement in their efforts for community policing," Dot Joyce, a Menino spokeswoman, said Tuesday. "While it may be a good program on the federal side, without changes, it does not work locally."\par \par \uc2 Boston's acting police commissioner, \uc2 William Evans\uc2 , echoed that stance. "Commissioner Evans agrees that to have an effective community policing effort you must have the trust of the people," said his spokeswoman, Cheryl Fiandaca. "He has been supportive of Mayor Menino in his continued efforts to change the policies around Secure Communities."\par \par \uc2 Immigrant activists said they were pleased that Walsh had clearly stated his opposition to Secure Communities.\par \par \uc2 "The program, unfortunately, is mandatory now," said Patricia Montes, executive director of Centro Presente, an immigration advocacy group in Somerville. "But he has the power at least to question the program, and to work with the immigrant community to make sure the program is not affecting people who don't have criminal records."\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Thomas O'Loughlin\uc2 , the police chief in Milford, said it would be a mistake to withdraw from the program.\par \par \uc2 His town has been a hotbed of debate over illegal immigration since 2011, when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was driving while drunk struck and killed a motorcyclist named Matthew Denice. "It doesn't focus on the person that came here for a better life, who came to here to work hard and was doing tough jobs. Why focus on them?" O'Loughlin said. "If he's a repetitive, serious offender, then that's the person they should focus on. I don't want that person living next to me."\par \par \uc2 Michael Levenson can be reached at mlevenson@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK -- As Chiwetel Ejiofor knows from personal experience, even the most accomplished actors can have moments of crushing self- doubt, when they question their own ability.\par \par \uc2 When Ejiofor, 36, a British actor known for "Inside Man" and "2012," first read the screenplay for director Steve McQueen's "12 Years a Slave," he knew he was holding a role-of-a-lifetime in his hands -- the kind of extraordinary part that actors would kick down doors and jump through hoops to land.\par \par \uc2 The movie, which opens on Friday, is based on the real-life story of Solomon Northup, a free African-American family man and professional violinist from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., who was kidnapped in 1841, ferried to Louisiana, and sold into slavery.\par \par \uc2 Already a front-runner in the early Oscar race, the film has the potential to rocket Ejiofor from character actor to bona-fide film star. It's just the kind of awards bait that Oscar voters can't resist: a story with a big subject and important themes, told in exacting period detail across a sprawling canvas, with a brave and resolute central protagonist. To top it off, the film's director, McQueen, is a Turner Prize-winning artist-turned-budding auteur who won warm reviews for his debut film, "Hunger," more mixed notices for his next, "Shame."\par \par \uc2 Still, Ejiofor wanted to be sure that he was the man for the task.\par \par \uc2 "I needed a moment to try and work out in my mind whether I could do that, whether I was the person to try and tell this story," says Ejiofor. His name, Oscar-watchers take note, is pronounced Choo-EH- tell Edge-ee-OH-for.\par \par \uc2 During a recent sit-down interview, Ejiofor, looking dapper in a dark, fitted blazer and dress pants, proves to be humble, gracious, preternaturally serene, and intently focused on the questions at hand.\par \par \uc2 He says that his hesitation came not just from self-doubt but a deep sense of responsibility he felt toward doing justice to a real- life man. On top of that, he'd gotten so swept up in Solomon's harrowing tale and the details of what he had to endure that Ejiofor says he failed to connect closely enough to Solomon himself.\par \par \uc2 "That's what I missed when I first read the script," he says. "My job was to tell the story of Solomon Northup, not the story of slavery. By connecting to him, then all of the rest of the story could be revealed. So it really became a search for Solomon. . . . A lot of the process for me was just trying to find his voice, his psychology, his spirit -- and hoping to be touched somewhere in the ether by his soul."\par \par \uc2 McQueen, on the other hand, had no such doubts about casting Ejiofor.\par \par \uc2 "Chiwetel was always the man. I wanted someone who had a certain kind of dignity and a gentleness about him," says the director. "The character has to hold onto his humanity under the worst kind of duress you can imagine, and he's tested to the absolute limit. And Chiwetel is one of the few, if only, actors I thought of who could actually hold onto that pressure during the process of the film -- even at breaking points. . . . But he went far beyond what I could ever imagine."\par \par \uc2 To understand Solomon Northrup, Ejiofor read his landmark 1853 memoir. Among many moving moments in the book, Ejiofor was struck by the line, "I would have gladly given a long year of servitude to have been enabled to exchange the heated oven [of the cotton fields] . . . for a seat in the shade."\par \par \uc2 "To have this sort of poetic humility to say, 'Listen, as bad as it was, these are the trade-offs that I would have given,' I was amazed at the depth and resilience of somebody to write that, to contemplate that sentiment, after going through this experience," Ejiofor says. "I suddenly realized that I was dealing with an individual with a unique spirit -- to survive this ordeal for this long and then to talk about it in such an eloquent way."\par \par \uc2 The film depicts slavery with an unflinching gaze. In its most harrowing tableau, captured largely in a single extended take, Solomon is hung in a noose from a tree branch, with his toes barely touching the mud below. As hours pass, he strains to stay alive by tip-toeing his feet on the ground and gasping for breath -- as the other slaves quietly go about their chores, fearful of the repercussions they could endure for intervening.\par \par \uc2 For Ejiofor, Solomon's predicament is like a "dark and twisted version" of "Alice in Wonderland," where a cultured free man with a wife and children has "slipped down the rabbit hole," he says, and fallen into a world of physical and mental brutality, ever-present fear, and the constant threat of violence. Still, what's remarkable about Solomon's story is his refusal to succumb to hopelessness -- even as his perspective shifts dramatically over 12 years.\par \par \uc2 "He finds himself in this terrifying parallel universe," Ejiofor says. "And the initial question is: How do I get back? But as the net is tightened around him, he starts to realize that this is going to destroy everything about him -- his soul, his mind, his heart. And then the real battle begins -- for his mind. He starts off in the film believing that he is in a fight for his freedom. But he soon begins to realize that he's a man who's fighting for his sanity."\par \par \uc2 Coming from an educated background, Solomon could read, write, and play violin. But he soon learned that those talents could be seen as threatening to the slave owners and white men who worked on the plantations. So he sought to keep those parts of himself hidden in order to survive. Therefore, wellsprings of suppressed emotion, largely left unspoken, must be communicated through silent expression alone.\par \par \uc2 "I spoke to Chiwetel about [Rudolph] Valentino and Buster Keaton, these silent movie stars that could communicate so much with a gaze, with just a look, with stillness. I wanted to hold and pay attention to his eyes," McQueen says. "Because basically his eyes are witness to these atrocities that are going on around him. We react to him as the audience, because we are him."\par \par \uc2 Before "12 Years a Slave," Ejiofor was known to film audiences as a revolutionary in "Children of Men," a strong-willed drag queen in "Kinky Boots" (now a hit Broadway musical), and an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  former African doctor in "Dirty Pretty Things." Ejiofor has also won raves for his extensive stage resume, including an Olivier Award- winning portrayal of Othello in London in 2007. And he can be seen this month on Starz playing band leader Louis Lester in the miniseries "Dancing on the Edge," about a fictional African- American jazz band in early 1930s London.\par \par \uc2 To prepare, Ejiofor visited several plantations in Louisiana and learned to play the violin. He spent time picking cotton, chopping timber, and hacking sugar cane. He also collected other slave stories and researched several large rebellions, including one where hundreds of escaped slaves were slaughtered in New Orleans.\par \par \uc2 While the actor hopes that the film sparks further dialogue about racial discrimination and slavery, he also believes that "the idea of human dignity and respect really transcends race."\par \par \uc2 "Every one of us, regardless of race, is capable of these high points and these incredible low points. So it's really about, as a collective of people, what do we care about in terms of our fellow man? What do we want for that person? Do we want to subjugate them? Do we want to benefit from them? Or do we want to see them eye-to- eye and progress together?"\par \par \uc2 Christopher Wallenberg can be reached at chriswallenberg@gmail .com.\par \par \uc2 Caption: Chiwetel Ejiofor (top right, with Michael Fassbender) stars in the real-life story of free man-turned-slave Solomon Northup in "12 Years a Slave," directed by  Steve McQueen (above right, with  Ejiofor).

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Last week, the White House said it wants a two-part immigration reform bill: a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants, in tandem with enhanced border security that will halt further illegal crossings into the United States. But Americans should not accept this combination, born of political necessity, without deeper examination.\par \par \uc2 A further militarization of the border with Mexico appears to be the immigration debate's equivalent of the Afghan surge. Just as an escalation of the war in Afghanistan was the political price candidate Barack Obama paid in 2008 for his promise to end the war in Iraq, it's obvious that more helicopters, razor wire, border agents, and drones to keep Latinos out have become the price being paid to regularize the status of Latinos who are already here.\par \par \uc2 Yet must every humane initiative be shackled to something inhuman? If so, this reform bargain on immigration will have unintended consequences, comparable to those that followed Obama's deal with the devil on Middle East wars.\par \par \uc2 An urgency marks the situation of the 11 million so-called illegals. "Not since the days of slavery," writes Douglas S. Massey in the current issue of the journal Daedalus, "have so many residents of the United States lacked the most basic social, economic, and human rights." President Obama's policy of "deferred action for childhood arrivals" gave some relief to those undocumented immigrants who came as children. Versions of the Dream Act, a measure rewarding college and military service, have passed in many states. But the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants live in constant fear of deportation, forced into a criminal underground that punishes them while giving the lie to American ideals. President Obama and most Democrats want to end this terrible situation, but escape from gridlock is not the same as surrender to it.\par \par \uc2 The "enhanced border security" that Republicans insisted upon in the Senate, and will again if the House ever takes up the reform bill, poses huge problems of its own. Indeed, the present crisis of a vast population of illegals has its origins in the myth of a closed border. That myth generated the entire phenomenon of criminalized immigrants. And it flies in the face of the new economic reality of the North American Free Trade Zone, where the number of people freely circulating among Mexico, Canada, and the United States should be expanded, not shrunk.\par \par \uc2 A so-called "circular migration" once allowed foreigners, especially Mexicans, to come and go, particularly for seasonal work. The emphasis on border enforcement since the 1980s put an end to that. With the border closed, migrants who wanted the work had an incentive to settle north of the border -- and to bring their families over. In 1988, there were 1.9 million undocumented immigrants. The 11 million here today are the unintended consequence of enhanced border security.\par \par \uc2 The irony is that, in this same period, beginning with the 1994 NAFTA agreement, the economies of Mexico, the United States, and Canada have formed the largest trade bloc on the planet, with the elimination of most tariffs, and the creation of interdependent investment mechanisms that bind the nations. Such an entwined economic structure could reasonably have been expected to increase mobility of populations -- as happened in the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , where internal borders were gradually erased. But that expectation was thwarted by post-9/11 insecurity and by an implicit white supremacy that demonizes Latinos.\par \par \uc2 To up the ante on southern border security now will only compound the mistake embedded in the whole notion of "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ." In the long history of entry to the United States, newcomers were commonly "undocumented" but not regarded thereby as criminal. Prior to the influx of Latino immigrants, there was a fluid transition from unauthorized to permitted: from "no papers" to green card to citizen. Today's emphasis on legal status -- what Michael Jones- Correa and Els de Graauw, also in the latest Daedalus, call "the illegality trap" -- ignores the normal pattern of immigrant assimilation going back centuries. If the dynamic has changed, it is because of a blatant but unacknowledged prejudice against Latinos -- not because today's immigrants have some unique disregard for American law. If there's an immigration crisis, it isn't the immigrants' fault.\par \par \uc2 The solution to all this is to de-emphasize border security and decriminalize immigration. Deportation should be rare. Borders should not be sealed, but managed, with the aim of restoring circular patterns of populations, to the benefit of the regional economy. Razor wire and drones are not remotely part of the answer. If even Obama keeps pretending that they are, the inevitable result will be not enhanced security, but an enhanced immigration crisis.\par \par \uc2 James Carroll writes regularly for the Globe.\par \par \uc2 Caption: A freeway sign warns drivers of people crossing in Chula Vista, Calif. file 2006/AFP   \par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020130812e98c0000x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- A proposal to collect unpaid taxes from illegal immigrants, introduced in hopes of gaining Republican support for legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, could complicate efforts to pass the bill, according to some analysts.\par \par \uc2 The Senate begins debate this week.\par \par \uc2 The amendment, authored by Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, would require illegal immigrants to pay any back taxes before applying for citizenship. Hatch is in a powerful position to sway other conservatives and he has said he would walk away from the bill if his "reasonable" amendment is not included.\par \par \uc2 Significantly, Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , the Florida Republican who is a key figure in the immigration debate, has said he supports Hatch on the issue. "We strongly support Senator Hatch's amendments to address the finance issues in the legislation," Rubio spokesman \uc2 Alex Conant\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 But critics said the amendment could hamper efforts to pass the bill. They said it is unrealistic to think that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who worked in the underground economy would be able to calculate unpaid taxes and pay potentially huge amounts to the government.\par \par \uc2 Senator Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat, said the measure was impractical. He said an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  might say, "I don't know what my back taxes are. I've worked for 12 years for these eight companies. Four of the companies paid me in cash."\par \par \uc2 Sixty-one percent of the nation's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population that arrived after 2001 works in the "underground economy," according to a 2009 \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  study, meaning they have no Social Security numbers.\par \par \uc2 These immigrants often receive wages in cash from a different employer at the end of each day and rarely pay income or Social Security taxes. The task of calculating and providing proof of what they owe may be too onerous and deter them from emerging from the underground, according to immigration advocates.\par \par \uc2 "Think about the day laborer who works day to day, going job to job, going back and trying to reconstruct their employment history in a way that would create a credible tax filing," said \uc2 Marshall Fitz\uc2 , immigration policy director at the \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2 , a liberal think tank. "It's not realistic."\par \par \uc2 According to the Immigrant Learning Center in Boston, the top five most popular jobs for immigrants living in Massachusetts range from low-wage day-labor jobs such as building maintenance and manufacturing to high-skilled salaried jobs in the tech sector and health care. As a result, there are likely to be "huge inconsistencies" in the employment histories of undocumented immigrants without Social Security numbers, according to Paul Watanabe, director of the Institute for Asian American Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston.\par \par \uc2 Immigration advocates in Massachusetts are split on the issue.\par \par \uc2 Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, welcomed the provision, saying that many Massachusetts immigrants already pay their taxes, often through a tax ID number.\par \par \uc2 Although data do not reveal what percentage of immigrants pay their taxes, families with an immigrant head of the household paid $1.36 billion in Massachusetts state income taxes in 2009, according to a study by UMass-Boston.\par \par \uc2 "I think we are at a very historic moment. Landmark legislation is about to pass, and we understand it is a compromise," Millona said.\par \par \uc2 But Rocio Saenz, president of the State Employees International Union 615 in Boston, opposes the legislation if it included a back- taxes provision.\par \par \uc2 "When you impose these back taxes and fees, it really makes it impossible for eligible immigrants to earn their legal status," Saenz said. "We are hoping to see that we continue a path to making it real and affordable and reasonable."\par \par \uc2 The citizenship seekers would not only need to pay back their income taxes but would also be accountable for seeing that their Social Security taxes, also known as payroll taxes, have been paid, a cost usually shared between employer and employee.\par \par \uc2 That is a problem because immigrants may have a hard time tracking down past employers and seeing that they pay their share, because employers may not be willing to disclose to the government that they hired an undocumented worker, according to Sharon Parrott, vice president for budget policy and economic opportunity at the \uc2 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\uc2 , a research and policy institute in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Some Republican supporters of the legislation signaled they have concerns about the back-taxes amendment but have left the door open for negotiation.\par \par \uc2 "I think there's going to be a lot of back and forth and a lot of compromises made with a piece of legislation like this, so I can't commit," said Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , the Arizona Republican. "We would certainly like to have Senator Hatch, but we'd like to have a lot of other people, too."\par \par \uc2 Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he wants to be sure that collecting immigrant taxes will not cost the Treasury more than it takes in.\par \par \uc2 "I don't mind putting a burden on people, but I want it to be an achievable burden and it be something that the system could absorb," said Graham.\par \par \uc2 Caption: Workers harvested cantaloupes near Firebaugh, Calif.

\par\par \uc2 Metro\par {\*\bkmkstart toc71}{\*\bkmkend toc71}\b \uc2 Heroes on our shores ; Kevin Cullen\b0\par\par\uc2 1,302 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2013\par \uc2 The Boston Globe\par \uc2 BSTNGB\par B.1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2013 New York Times Company.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 I'm a sucker for nuns and people who are kind to the less fortunate, so Lena Deevy is a two-fer.\par \par \uc2 I call her Sister Lena, because she's a nun, and that's what I call nuns, but most people just call her Lena. I love nuns because they devote their lives to the poor, and are usually poor themselves, but only in a material sense, because nuns like Sister Lena are richer in other ways because of what they do with their lives. I love Sister Lena because of what she has done with her life.\par \par \uc2 What Sister Lena has done with her life is dedicate it to helping newcomers, immigrants, and helping the old comers, like me, remember our own roots, so that we never forget where we came from, and for most of us it was not from these shores. She runs the Boston Irish International Immigrant Center, which is sort of a misnomer because Sister Lena has helped as many Africans as she has Irish.\par \par \uc2 Sister Lena is retiring this week, and so it is a good time to consider the issue and cause to which she has dedicated her life.\par \par \uc2 Because we were attacked by a pair of immigrants, because those immigrants killed and maimed our people, because some other immigrants helped dispose of evidence that implicated the bombers, some people have used that atrocity to lump all immigrants in a pile, point to it as a problem. Some people have reduced the attack on us to some ridiculous, politically inspired rant against immigrants and welfare, because the immigrant family of the men who attacked us got welfare benefits.\par \par \uc2 Really?\par \par \uc2 I'm as angry as anybody that a pair of brothers repaid this country's generosity by spitting in our faces with bombs that murdered and maimed. I'm furious that some kids from Kazakhstan would take advantage of our university system and then try to help one of the bombers by destroying evidence.\par \par \uc2 But using that atrocity to score cheap, partisan political points is more than tawdry. It exploits a national tragedy, and local suffering, to the point that it dishonors the dead. It dishonors the wounded and our heroic first responders and our marvelous medical community who saved so many lives, many of whom are the children and grandchildren of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 For all you who think that what happened on Patriots Day means we should seal up our borders and turn inward and look at foreigners with suspicion, congratulations, because you are doing exactly what the bombers wanted.\par \par \uc2 They wanted to divide us.\par \par \uc2 They wanted us to turn on each other.\par \par \uc2 But we didn't do that. We didn't turn on each other. We turned, as Governor Patrick put it, toward each other. The firefighters from Engine 7, the police officers from District 4, the EMTs and paramedics from the city's Emergency Medical Services, ran toward the explosions. They didn't check people's identification before they decided whose life to save. They didn't save Americans first, and foreigners second.\par \par \uc2 The doctors and nurses and all the great medical people who triaged the wounded in the tent on Boylston Street didn't ask the wounded for their passports before they saved their lives. The people who received the wounded at our hospitals didn't ask the nationality of their patients before sticking an IV in their arms.\par \par \uc2 Remember that iconic photo of the guy in the cowboy hat, pinching Jeff Bauman's femoral artery shut so he wouldn't bleed to death? That guy in the cowboy hat is named Carlos Arredondo. When I saw him at the Celtics game on Sunday I gave him a hug. When they put Carlos's image up on the jumbotron, the Garden went crazy.\par \par \uc2 Carlos Arredondo was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Costa Rica. After his son, a Marine, was killed in action in Iraq, Carlos was granted American citizenship. That's a high price to pay for legal residency. And I guess there are some people in this world who think Carlos should have been deported.\par \par \uc2 I'm glad he wasn't deported. Jeff Bauman is alive because he wasn't deported.\par \par \uc2 The Chechen brothers who killed and maimed so many would have had a much better chance of killing and maiming others with their stockpiled bombs if not for the actions of Danny, the 26-year-old immigrant from China whose SUV the bombers carjacked, and an Egyptian immigrant who sheltered him.\par \par \uc2 Danny made a bold escape from the bombers, running zig zag lest they shoot him as he fled. Danny was sheltered by a 45-year-old immigrant from Egypt named Tarek Ahmed, who was working the cash register at the Mobil station on Memorial Drive in Cambridge. Tarek was working his usual 12-hour shift, from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., when Danny burst in, afraid that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was about to follow and kill him.\par \par \uc2 "They want to kill me!" Danny told Tarek.\par \par \uc2 Tarek Ahmed calmly dialed 911. He did not look out at the man with the gun. Tarek told my colleague Maria Sacchetti that he feared death but he stayed calm.\par \par \uc2 Lives were saved because Danny was brave and because Tarek Ahmed was brave.\par \par \uc2 It hurt Tarek to hear people later disparage all Muslims because the bombers were Muslim.\par \par \uc2 "The problem in this city is anything that happens, they say, 'It's Muslims.' I am a Muslim," Tarek Ahmed said. "I protected him. They could have killed me. After everything finished, no one protected me."\par \par \uc2 Dan Linskey, the chief of the Boston Police, who should get a medal but will instead be second-guessed by armchair cops, told me a few days after it was all over that he was immensely proud of both Danny and Tarek Ahmed.\par \par \uc2 "Heroes," he said. "Absolute heroes."\par \par \uc2 Dan Linskey, a former Marine who is very close to Carlos Arredondo, and I hope to someday attend the citizenship ceremonies for Danny and Tarek Ahmed. They are exactly the sort of people we should want to become Americans.\par \par \uc2 The immigrants who carried out the Patriots Day bombing personified the worst of human nature. And the response to that attack, on the streets, in the hospitals, showcased the best of human nature. Our wounded are recovering in hospitals that are kept clean and operating by workers who are mostly immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A fitting tribute to the likes of Carlos Arredondo and Danny and Tarek Ahmed would be to finally pass some meaningful immigration reform, to give a path to citizenship to immigrants here and not yet here. Contrary to the xenophobic, small-minded prattling of tabloids and talk shows, most immigrants come here to work, to have a better life, to breathe in the freedom and the opportunity that is at the root of this nation's greatness. The vast majority are not here to mooch off the rest of us. They want the same life we have. They are, no matter where they come from, aspirational Americans.\par \par \uc2 We are a nation of immigrants, and we have allowed our immigration system to descend into a shambles. A fine legacy to the attack on us by immigrants who spurned our tolerance and generosity would be to make life better for the vast majority of immigrants who love this country as much as the native born.\par \par \uc2 And, finally, to Sister Lena, on her retirement from a life of helping immigrants from everywhere make Boston their home, as they say back on your native island: Good on ye, Sister.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHELSEA -- Elder A. Morales routinely sat on the front porch of 52 Blossom St., chatting with his close friend who lived at that address, neighbors said.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday night six men walked "purposely" toward them and one of them, his face partially covered by a bandana, took out a knife and exchanged words with the 21-year-old Morales and his friend. Seconds later, another man in the group, Manuel Castro, a 22-year- old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, took out a revolver and shot Morales at close range, hitting him in the chest and back of the head, prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 Morales was taken to Whidden Hospital in Everett, where he was pronounced dead.\par \par \uc2 "The defendant himself, in tape-recorded statements with police, told them he is an 18th Street gang member and Mr. Morales was MS- 13.\par \par \uc2 . . . There's a long-running feud between those two groups in the city of Chelsea," said Mark Zanini, Suffolk assistant district attorney, during Castro's arraignment in Chelsea District Court Wednesday afternoon. "The defendant also said that he shot the victim a number of times. The defendant also told police about his efforts to dispose of his jacket, clothing, gloves, mask, and gun," Zanini said.\par \par \uc2 Fran Robinson, the attorney who represented Castro, of Everett, pleaded not guilty to murder charges on his behalf. Castro was ordered held without bail pending a probable cause hearing April 8. A \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  detainer was also issued against the defendant.\par \par \uc2 Castro initially told police his name was Jonathan Castro-Salas, but his true identity, Manuel Castro, was confirmed through fingerprints and the \uc2 US Department of Justice\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A woman who lives at 52 Blossom said she was watching television just before 9 p.m. Tuesday when she heard two loud gunshots erupt from the street below. The woman, who declined to give her name, said she looked outside and saw Morales being pulled into the foyer of the multifamily three-decker by his friend who he had been sitting with him. "It was horrible," the woman said. "When the ambulance came and put him on the stretcher, he wasn't moving at all." Police, aided by surveillance video, witnesses, and Castro's alleged statements, arrested him just hours after the homicide, the first in the city this year. Chelsea recorded 11 murders in 2010, none in 2011, and two last year.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday's homicide was similar to one in 2011 in Chelsea, carried out by Santos Portillo, 22, who identified himself as a MS-13 member.\par \par \uc2 Portillo, of Chelsea, was sentenced earlier this year to life in prison for fatally shooting Braulio Gomez of Chelsea. Portillo approached a group of men whom he did not know as they socialized on the porch of a Central Avenue residence about 2:20 a.m.\par \par \uc2 on July 8, 2011, and asked what "set" -- or gang -- the men belonged to. When Gomez told Portillo that none of the men had ties to any gang, Portillo pulled out a gun and shot Gomez in the head, prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 The MS-13 gang, considered by many law enforcement agencies across the country to be one of the most violent, originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s by Salvadoran immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "The information I get from my detectives and my officers on the street, and so forth, as far as a gang problem in general, we don't really see much of it in the city of Chelsea," said Police Chief Brian Kyes during a telephone interview.\par \par \uc2 Residents of Blossom Street said their neighborhood is quiet and not prone to violence, despite being the scene of the city's latest homicide. "I've lived here for two years and nothing like this ever happened," said Ismeralda Perez. "I have my children living here and I was at work when it happened, so I was very worried about them."\par \par \uc2 State Police investigators interviewed Castro's relatives and friends Wednesday afternoon at the defendant's home on Main Street in Everett.\par \par \uc2 Castro was employed as a painter for Crystal Painting in Everett and has a tattoo on his upper right arm of a devil face and '18th St,' according to court records.\par \par \uc2 Brian Ballou can be reached at bballou@globe.com.

After stepping off the bus Monday morning and grabbing a breakfast of fruit from a small buffet table inside the Haitian Assembly of God Church on Court Street in Brockton, Gomez told her story.\par \par \uc2 She and the other families visited Nashua, New Haven, Providence, Worcester, Brockton, and, at the tour's last stop, East Boston. They spoke about their plight and the need for immigration changes. The New England Keeping Families -Together Bus Tour started Saturday morning, leaving from downtown Boston. The tour was organized by the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.\par \par \uc2 "It's been a great chance to share their stories and why it's important," said Pedro Portillo, a coalition organizer who participated. "The psychological and emotional damage to children and parents when they are separated through deportation is unbelievable.\par \par \uc2 "We're trying to empower other families who have been in the shadows for so long, to speak up, to let it be known that they have a struggle that needs to be resolved," he said. "We are urging everyone to contact their elected official and tell them that now is the time for immigration reform."\par \par \uc2 Escaping poverty in Guatemala with a desire to provide for her siblings and mother still there, Gomez crossed the border in Texas in 2004 and headed to Boston, she said. After two years here, she married a naturalized citizen from El -Salvador and they had a child.\par \par \uc2 But Gomez learned that she would have to return to -Guatemala as part of her path to US citizenship. She was told that the wait could take as long as a decade. She decided to risk staying here to keep her family together.\par \par \uc2 Last year, according to statistics provided by the White House, more than 780,000 people became naturalized citizens, but there are 11 million people who "live in the shadows" as illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Rosmery Hernandez arrived in the United States from -Honduras eight years ago, after her parents left that country and sent for her. The 19-year-old graduated from Lynn -English High School last year, with a 3.4 grade point average while taking honors courses and is now a freshman on scholarship at North Shore Community College in Lynn. Hernandez said she hopes to get a degree in early childhood education.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez is undocumented but was approved recently for the government's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which defers action on people who came into the United States illegally as children, provided they meet certain criteria.\par \par \uc2 "Not having papers is not a conversation you have with your friends in high school," Hernandez said. "They notice things, ask why I didn't visit my country, or drive, or have a job."\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said her senior year was not what she thought it would be. When the issue of immigration overhaul arose during lunch friends, "It was like, 'Boom!' a bomb went off," she said, referring to her friends' comments that undocumented families had no place in this country.\par \par \uc2 "I was just sitting down trying not to cry. I never felt so - attacked by my own friends, people who sat at my table. We shared time not only in the classroom but outside. I wanted to get out of that room and never go back to school, because I felt so much hate," she said. Hernandez said she broke off those friendships.\par \par \uc2 "I have to prepare myself now. I want so much out of life," she said. "I have the energy to do it, the ambition. I'm young, and now I'm out of the shadows. I feel like nothing in life can stop me from getting what I want."\par \par \uc2 Brian Ballou can be reached at bballou@globe.com or on -\uc2 Twitter\uc2  at @globeballou.\par \par \uc2 Caption: Kai Sarmiento stood with the Keeping Families Together Bus Tour at the Haitian Assembly of God in Brockton.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- A week before mandatory budget cuts go into effect across the government, the Department of Homeland Security has started releasing illegal immigrants being held in immigration jails across the country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Gillian Christensen, an agency spokeswoman, said it has reviewed several hundred cases of immigrants being held and released them in the last week. They have been ''placed on an appropriate, more cost- effective form of supervised release," she said.\par \par \uc2 Christensen said the agency's ''priority for detention remains on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety." She did not say how released immigrants were selected or what jails they were released from.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday's announcement of the releases is the first tangible impact of the looming budget cuts for the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration has been issuing dire warnings about the impact of the sequestration and Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Janet Napolitano\uc2  told reporters at the White House on Monday that across- the-board cuts would affect the department's core operations, including border security and airport screening operations.\par \par \uc2 She also warned that the department might not be able to afford to keep the 34,000 immigration jail beds mandated by Congress. On average last week, there were 30,773 people being held in immigration jails.\par \par \uc2 According to the National Immigration Forum, it costs the government about $164 a day to keep an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  facing deportation jailed. In a report on immigration detention costs last year the advocacy group said costs for supervised release can range from about 30 cents to $14 a day.\par \par \uc2 Republicans lawmakers decried the releases Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 ''It's abhorrent that President Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration," said Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. ''By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives."\par \par \uc2 Christensen said released immigrants would still face deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 President Obama appealed to congressional Republicans on Tuesday to pass legislation delaying or softening the budget cuts. He traveled to Newport News, Va., where he stood in the facility that builds the country's aircraft carriers, and warned that reductions in the Pentagon budget threatens the jobs of thousands of workers.\par \par \uc2 ''These cuts are wrong." he said. "They're not smart. They are not fair."\par \par \uc2 Globe wires\par \par \uc2 Former state lawmaker wins primary for Jackson's seat\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO -- Former Illinois legislator Robin Kelly captured the Democratic nomination Tuesday in the race to replace disgraced former representative Jesse Jackson Jr., after a truncated campaign season in which she got a boost from New York City Mayor \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2 's super PAC.\par \par \uc2 The nomination all but assures that she will sail through the April 9 general election because the district is overwhelmingly Democratic.\par \par \uc2 The Republican nomination was also being chosen Tuesday night.\par \par \uc2 From a crowded field of candidates in the Chicago-area district, Kelly emerged early as a leader on gun-control issues. The former state representative from Matteson, a south Chicago suburb, favors an assault weapons ban.\par \par \uc2 During the campaign, Bloomberg's super PAC, Independence USA, poured more than $2 million into the race by airing antigun ads in her favor and against another Democratic front-runner, former representative Debbie Halvorson, who opposes such a ban.\par \par \uc2 Guns were a leading issue at candidate forums and e-mail blasts from candidates, even as Jackson's legal saga played out in court and frustrated voters who've seen two other congressmen in the office leave under an ethical or legal cloud.\par \par \uc2 Jackson resigned in November, after a months-long medical leave for treatment of bipolar disorder and other issues, then pleaded guilty earlier this month to charges that accused him of misspending $750,000 in campaign money on lavish personal items, including a Rolex watch and fur coats.\par \par \uc2 Jackson's exit created a rare opening in a district where he was first elected in 1995.\par \par \uc2 The primary featured 14 Democrats, including former representative Mel Reynolds, who held the seat in the 1990s but served prison time after being convicted of fraud and for having sex with an underage campaign volunteer.\par \par \uc2 There were four Republicans on the ballot.\par \par \uc2 ASSOCIATED PRESS\par \par \uc2 Caption: President Obama, speaking at a shipyard where the nation's aircraft carriers are built, blasted Washington politics for the budget impasse and the threat it presents to workers' jobs.

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 For those who have never experienced legislative debates over comprehensive immigration reform, welcome to the circus, and hang on to your seats. Barely a nanosecond after President Obama complimented the bipartisan guidelines for reform announced this week by the Senate's "gang of eight," seasoned skeptics began to parse any differences between the White House and Congress. The potential show-stopper involves the Senate proposal to create a Southwest border commission, comprised of local and state officials and community members. It will assess the progress of border security measures as a part of a process toward citizenship for the 12 million undocumented immigrants in country.\par \par \uc2  None of the "gang" has made entirely clear the powers of this commission; Democrats have said it would provide non-binding recommendations, but Republican \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  has suggested it would essentially have veto power over any efforts to grant amnesty to undocumented workers.\par \par \uc2 The controversy over the Southwest border commission already has a name: the "trigger" issue.\par \par \uc2 Trying to discern the true nature of the commission is bait, a red herring, that the left seems all too eager to take. If Democrats use it to block comprehensive immigration reform, they'll be giving the GOP a way out of a huge political mess. Republicans are under intense pressure to pass comprehensive reform, or risk further alienating Latino voters, but there are huge chunks of the party's own base that remain adamantly opposed.\par \par \uc2 The commission itself is actually a good idea that will make reform much more palatable to border states. Immigration is many things, but it is mostly local. Progressives have long believed in the notion of cooperative federalism -- that the most intractable issues of our time are best resolved when local, state, and federal resources work in a cooperative and unified fashion. Such cooperation is what animates almost every major public policy effort in the modern age. Community efforts, often dubbed "having a seat at the table," are just a means for state and local buy-in to a federal policy, whether in environmental planning efforts, education, disaster relief, public safety, tax codes, or health care.\par \par \uc2 It should be no different with immigration. Pro-reform activists have, ironically, been making that same argument, often balking at federal enforcement efforts that seem inconsistent with state or local priorities. For example, when the federal government demanded that police forces help identify illegal immigrants, many communities pushed back strongly -- they felt the effort to enforce immigration laws would undermine local police's relationships with their communities.\par \par \uc2 For people along the Southwest border, immigration enforcement is more than an unpleasant duty that the president has to perform to maintain his public-safety credentials. Enforcement needs are real; public safety and security is what citizens of border states, and their elected officials, demand.\par \par \uc2 It has admittedly been tough and complicated to secure the border. The United States spends more money on border enforcement than all other immigration policies combined. Net migration from Mexico is down to zero, the result of a bad economy in the United States and the billions of dollars spent on fences, drones, and agents. President Obama has deported 1.5 million people for unlawful status.\par \par \uc2 The successes of border enforcement have helped make border politics more dynamic. For every \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2 , the Arizona governor who built her career on anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  sentiment, there is a Rick Perry, the Texas Governor who embraces amnesty. Mayors like Ken Miyagishima of Las Cruces, N.M., Raul Salinas of Laredo, Texas, and \uc2 Greg Stanton\uc2  of Phoenix know the necessity of giving immigrants legal status, if only to boost the local tax base. These politicians, too, will have a spot on the Southwest border commission.\par \par \uc2 The Senate guidelines are just a draft. Other language in the document appears to limit the powers of the border commission. It's unlikely that even Republicans in Congress will want to give the commission too much control over border policy; they know that there are liberal states like California on the border, too.\par \par \uc2 This commission doesn't merit vilification. It does nothing more than establish a formal mechanism by which the politically diverse communities most affected by federal policies can have a seat at the table. In almost every other issue, that is what progressives have been arguing for all along.\par \par \uc2 Juliette Kayyem\uc2  can be reached at jkayyem@globe.com and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  @juliettekayyem.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020130131e91v0006c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As President Obama prepared to unveil his plan to overhaul the nation's immigration system Tuesday, advocates for immigrants in Massachusetts and nationwide mobilized for what they say is their best chance in almost three decades to secure a path to US citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Advocates say Obama's -recent victory and Republican attempts to appease Latino voters who flexed their political muscle last year could propel Congress to pass legislation that has failed repeatedly, even as the number of illegal immigrants climbed to the highest levels in US history.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's going to happen this year," said Eva A. Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, which is among the groups pushing for citizenship and other changes. "The blueprint is out there. The expectation is there."\par \par \uc2 Obama is to reveal his plan for immigration Tuesday in a speech at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas, in the home state of Senate majority leader \uc2 Harry Reid\uc2 , where the Latino population has ballooned in the last decade.\par \par \uc2 The president's speech comes one day after a bipartisan \uc2 group of eight\uc2  senators, including New York Democrat Charles Schumer and Republican \uc2 John McCain\uc2  of Arizona, released their own immigration proposal in Washington, calling it a "tough, fair, and practical road map" that would let illegal immigrants pay a fine and back taxes and apply for legal residency, and someday, US citizenship. The plan would also make it easier for farm workers and highly educated immigrants to remain in the country. Serious criminals would still be subject to deportation.\par \par \uc2 The senators' plan also would beef up immigration enforce-ment in the United States and punish businesses that hire illegal workers with "stiff fines and criminal penalties."\par \par \uc2 "We will ensure that this is a successful permanent reform to our immigration system that will not need to be revisited," the senators said in a statement released Monday.\par \par \uc2 Details of the president's proposal were sparse in -advance of his speech. But it is expected to be similarly sweeping at fixing what the White House called "our broken immi-gration system so it is fair and helps grow our middle class and it ensures everyone is playing by the same rules."\par \par \uc2 Critics of the Senate group's plan said they have heard promises of tough and lasting changes before, such as in the bipartisan legislation known as the Immigration Reform and Control Act that Ronald Reagan signed in 1986. The law legalized nearly 3 million illegal immi-grants and promised to -increase enforcement, making it a crime for employers to knowingly hire illegal immigrants. But enforcement proved to be weak, allowing the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population to soar to 12 million nationwide, though the numbers have since declined, along with the economy.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody's going to want to repeat that mistake that obviously didn't fix the problem," said \uc2 Jessica Vaughan\uc2 , director of policy studies for the \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2 , a group in Washington that -favors limits on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Vaughan, who lives in Massa-chusetts, said she doubted a massive package such as the senators' proposal would pass because of ongoing opposition to illegal immigration, and she pointed out that bipartisan efforts have failed before, includ-ing one led by President Bush in 2007. She said that Congress would be more likely to approve less ambitious legislation, such as a bill that would let the undocumented children of illegal immigrants stay in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "On the immigration issue, bipartisan doesn't mean much, because this issue does not -divide along traditional partisan lines," she said.\par \par \uc2 Other groups, such as the \uc2 Federation for American Immigration Reform\uc2 , slammed the senators' proposal Monday and vowed to fight it.\par \par \uc2 "We expect that once the American public learns of the details of this proposal and comes to recognize that it will do nothing to fix the problems of our broken immigration system, it will meet with the same overwhelmingly negative -response that it -received in 2007," said the group's president, \uc2 Dan Stein\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Others were cautiously optimistic, particularly grass-roots immigration groups who have been disappointed by the Obama administration's tough approach to illegal immigration in the past.\par \par \uc2 In Boston and nationwide, the walls of immigration courts are still papered with the names of immigrants from -Brazil, China, and El Salvador who face deportation every day, and last year federal immigration officials deported 409,849 immigrants, including more than 184,000 people who had no criminal records.\par \par \uc2 Hours before the senators unveiled their proposal Monday, Patricia Montes and several other advocates stood in the frigid cold before \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 's offices in Burlington, hoping to forestall deportation of a 36-year-old mother of three from Guatemala.\par \par \uc2 "We are optimistic, but we know that we have to do a lot of work," said Montes, executive director of Centro Presente, a statewide group based in Somerville that advocates for immigrants. "There are too many people around the US confronting the same situation."\par \par \uc2 President Obama's speech Tuesday in some ways circles back to his first year in office. In his 2008 campaign, the president promised to tackle immigration reform in his first year in office, but the issue faded amid economic problems after the stock market crash. States such as Arizona and Georgia passed their own laws restricting immigration, and others, including Massachusetts, held passionate debates.\par \par \uc2 But analysts say 2013 could be ripe for the most significant immigration overhaul since 1986. The economy is improving, companies and agriculture need workers, and, after \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's bruising loss to Obama last year, Republicans feel compelled to reach out to Latino voters.\par \par \uc2 "I think that this year we're in the best position to pass a bill," said Roberto Gonzales, a sociologist and a professor at the \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2  in -Illinois, where the governor just signed a measure to give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, a rarity in the United States. "Certainly it's the best chance we have."\par \par \uc2 Though many advocates are hopeful that an immigration overhaul will pass this year, they say working out the -details could take months, if not longer. Will lawmakers pass a massive immigration package or several small pieces? Will immi-grants have to pay a fine for being here illegally, and if so, how much?\par \par \uc2 "Things have changed," said Professor Frank D. Bean, director of the Center for Research on Immigration, Population, and Public Policy at the University of California, Irvine.\par \par \uc2 "But there's still a lot of things that have to happen," he said. "There's a lot of issues -involved and a lot of political nuances and so on."\par \par \uc2 Maria Sacchetti can be reached at msacchetti@globe.com. -Follow her on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  -@mariasacchetti.\par \par \uc2 Caption: Senators John McCain, Charles Schumer, and Marco Rubio discussed what they called a "tough, fair, and practical road map" on immigration Monday at the US Capitol.

\par\par \uc2 National\par {\*\bkmkstart toc77}{\*\bkmkend toc77}\b \uc2 The candidate who never really let voters in ; A Globe review finds many reasons for Romney's failure, none greater than how slow he was to tell his own story\b0\par\par\uc2 Michael Kranish   \par \uc2 By Michael Kranish Globe Staff\par \uc2 4,816 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 December 2012\par \uc2 The Boston Globe\par \uc2 BSTNGB\par A.1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2012 New York Times Company.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It was two weeks before Election Day when Mitt Romney's political -director signed a memo that all but ridiculed the notion that the Republican presidential nominee, with his "better ground game," could lose the key state of Ohio or the election. The race is "unmistakably moving in Mitt Romney's direction," the memo said.\par \par \uc2 But the claims proved wildly off the mark, a fact embarrassingly underscored when the high-tech voter turnout system that Romney himself called "state of the art" crashed at the worst moment, on Election Day.\par \par \uc2 To this day, Romney's aides wonder how it all went so wrong.\par \par \uc2 They console each other with claims that the election was much closer than realized, saying that Romney would be president if roughly 370,000 people in swing states had voted differently. Romney himself blamed demographic shifts and Obama's "gifts": -federal largesse targeted to Democratic constituencies.\par \par \uc2 But a reconstruction by the Globe of how the campaign unfolded shows that Romney's problems went deeper than is widely understood. His campaign made a series of costly financial, strategic, and political mistakes that, in retrospect, all but assured the candidate's defeat, given the revolutionary turnout tactics and tactical smarts of President Obama's operation.\par \par \uc2 One of the gravest errors, many say, was the Romney team's failure, until too late in the campaign, to sell voters on the candidate's personal qualities and leadership gifts. The effect was to open the way for Obama to define Romney through an early blitz of negative advertising. Election Day polls showed that the vast majority of voters concluded that Romney did not really care about average people.\par \par \uc2 These failures are now the subject of scrutiny by national GOP - officials who say they plan to "reverse engineer" the -Romney effort to understand what went wrong. A number of Romney's top aides stressed in interviews that, while they -remain proud of their work, they feel an obligation to -acknowledge their numerous mistakes so lessons are learned.\par \par \uc2 Rich Beeson, the Romney political director who co-authored the now-discredited Ohio memo, said that only after the election did he realize what Obama was doing with so much manpower on the ground. Obama had more than 3,000 paid workers nationwide, compared with 500 for Romney, and hundreds of thousands of volunteers.\par \par \uc2 "Now I know what they were doing with all the staffs and - offices," Beeson said. "They were literally creating a one-to-one contact with voters," something that Romney did not have the staff to match.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, as it happened, had lost track of their own winning formula.\par \par \uc2 Democrats said they followed the trail blazed in 2004 by the Bush campaign which used an array of databases to "microtarget" voters and a sophis-ticated field organization to turn them out. Obama won in part by updating the GOP's innovation.\par \par \uc2 But losing seemed a remote and unlikely prospect when Romney gathered advisers in Boston and planned the campaign they all believed would put him in the White House.\par \par \uc2 Private nature\par \par \uc2 Romney's inner circle of family and friends understood the candidate's weakness all too well: He was a deeply private person, with an aversion to reveal-ing too much of himself to the public. They worried that unless the candidate opened up, he would too easily be -reduced to caricature, as a calculating man of astounding wealth, a man unable to relate to average folks, a man whose Mormon faith put him outside the mainstream.\par \par \uc2 Romney's eldest son, Tagg, drew up a list of 12 people whose lives had been helped by his father in ways that were publicly unknown but had been deeply personal and significant, such as assisting a dying teenager in writing a will or quietly helping families in financial need. Such compelling -vignettes would have been welcome material in almost any other campaign. But Romney's strategists worried that stressing his personal side would backfire, and a rift opened -between some in Romney's circle and his strategists that lasted until the convention. More than being reticent, Romney was at first far from sold on a second presidential run. Haunted by his 2008 loss, he initially told his family he would not do it. While candidates often try to portray themselves as reluctant, Tagg insisted his father's stance was genuine.\par \par \uc2 "He wanted to be president less than anyone I've met in my life. He had no desire to . . . run," said Tagg, who worked with his mother, Ann, to persuade his father to seek the presidency. "If he could have found someone else to take his place . . . he would have been ecstatic to step aside. He is a very private person who loves his family deeply and wants to be with them, but he has deep faith in God and he loves his country, but he doesn't love the attention."\par \par \uc2 Adding to the discomfort was Romney's inability to persuade one of his most valued advisers to join the team. Mike Murphy, who had engineered Romney's successful race for governor of Massachusetts, under-stood Romney like few others. While Murphy said he was flattered by Romney's overture, he decided to remain in California, where he was working as a screenwriter and part-time political commentator. So Romney eventually picked as his strategist a man with whom Murphy had repeatedly clashed, Stuart Stevens.\par \par \uc2 Stevens had helped guide the presidential campaigns of \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 , but he was equally well known as an -author and screenwriter. He had scripted episodes of "Northern Exposure" and told remarkable stories about himself, such as when he wrote in Outside magazine about taking "some of the banned performance-enhancing drugs that are often abused in the -endurance sports I participate in, like cycling and cross-country skiing." He seemed like an unusual match for the strait-laced Romney, but some felt that was precisely what the candidate needed.\par \par \uc2 Stevens had clashed over the years with other campaign consultants, and sniping about his work from the outside came quickly. He had worked on Romney's 2008 campaign, but had to share power with other advisers, an unworkable arrangement. This time, Romney promised Stevens and partner Russ Schriefer full control.\par \par \uc2 Stevens wanted to keep the focus on Obama's handling of the economy and what Romney would do to fix it. A candidate's biography was of lesser importance. "When you come into a job interview, you don't start showing family pictures," -Stevens said in a postelection interview.\par \par \uc2 Family members kept pushing for a film or series of advertisements that would show how Romney had helped average people in personal ways, based on Tagg's list of 12 people, along with clips about how Romney raised his family. The film project was to be overseen by documentary filmmaker Greg Whiteley, a longtime family friend who had been allowed to film portions of Romney's 2008 campaign. But the plan was rejected, leading some in the family to blame Stevens.\par \par \uc2 Stevens said he did not kill the documentary. But he said he did have a strategic vision that went another way, one he grounded in four questions he put to voters in focus groups.\par \par \uc2 "There [were] different -areas that you could go into," Stevens said. "Talk about Mitt's business record, Mitt's personal story, what Mitt would do as president . . . and why \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  is bad. We tested all four equally. We were open to doing any combination, and the one that tested far and away the best, people wanted to know what Mitt Romney would do as president."\par \par \uc2 Romney made the final call: This was Stevens' campaign to win or lose. And the outlook seemed bright. The veteran GOP pollster Romney hired, Neil Newhouse, found that only 20 percent of those surveyed thought the country was on the right track.\par \par \uc2 It was, Newhouse said, "extra-ordinarily negative. We figured those numbers probably wouldn't hold, but if they were anything near that, we were probably in very good shape."\par \par \uc2 Organizing strategy\par \par \uc2 President Obama's strategy had very different roots.\par \par \uc2 His national field director, Jeremy Bird, drew his inspiration from the time around 2001 when he witnessed, as a young \uc2 Harvard\uc2  Divinity student, a group of African-American students in a Roxbury church, pressing their case for school funding with members of the Boston City Council.\par \par \uc2 It was a model, in miniature, of grass-roots engagement that would shape Bird's career in politics and attract him to Obama, who had himself been a community organizer.\par \par \uc2 Bird was confident that Obama would commit massive resources to building an organization that zeroed in on individual voters. It would be like that Roxbury church encounter, multiplied a thousand times.\par \par \uc2 "I had watched a group of young people come together; I watched them organize at local level," Bird said.\par \par \uc2 And Bird had learned another lesson. He lived in Massachusetts when Romney was elected governor, had studied him and voted against him, and was determined to do everything possible to prevent him from -becoming president.\par \par \uc2 So it was that Bird and his colleagues drew up plans to -expand the electorate into one that could reelect Obama. In Ohio, for example, a "barber shop and beauty salon" strategy was designed to get likely Obama supporters, particularly African-Americans, to register to vote when they went for a haircut. "Faith captains" were assigned to churches to encourage parishioners to turn out for Obama. "Condo captains" were told to know every potential Obama voter in their building. The goal was like nothing seen in presidential politics: Each Obama worker would be -responsible for about 50 voters in key precincts over the course of the campaign. By Election Day, that worker would know much about the lives of those 50 voters, including whether they had made it to the polls. Romney's team talked about a ratio of thousands of voters per worker. It would prove to be a crucial difference.\par \par \uc2 Technical edge\par \par \uc2 A first-class ground operation in 2012 required leading-edge technology, and here also an early gap opened between Obama and Romney.\par \par \uc2 The goal was to create the political equivalent of a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  or Twitter, a platform that would change the way presidential campaigns are run. And Obama's team found just the man for the job: a 34-year- old programming whiz named Harper Reed, who got his start as an 11- year-old pecking on an Apple II and had never held a top job in a political campaign. With his wildly flowing black hair, big earrings, and bigger glasses, he was not long on humil-ity -- his website proclaimed that "I am pretty awesome" -- but his talents were real.\par \par \uc2 As Reed assembled his team, he insisted on being given leeway to hire some of the best techies in the country, from -\uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Craigslist\uc2 , Twitter. Moreover, he insisted the team be largely internal, rather than have the enterprise be divided up among outside consultants.\par \par \uc2 The group was haunted by the failure of a similar venture in Obama's 2008 campaign, when a get-out-the-vote computer program called Houdini crashed and could have cost the election if the race had been closer. This time, Reed and his team created a successor that they named Gordon, after the person who punched Houdini in the stomach shortly before the magician died.\par \par \uc2 Separately, the Obama team created a system called -Narwahl, named after an Arctic whale, which linked disparate computer programs together. Narwahl and Gordon would be tested repeatedly in exercises that Obama's team called "game day." Every imaginable failure would be thrown at the systems -- hacker attacks, database meltdowns, Internet failures -- and the team would be challenged to write up a manual for how to deal with each -disaster. It was, they said, more fun than the fantasy war game Dungeons & Dragons.\par \par \uc2 Election app\par \par \uc2 Zac Moffatt, Romney's digital director, did not have the luxury of Reed's time or -resources. Moffatt came from the world of politics, had worked at the Republican -National Committee and had long believed Romney would be the best GOP candidate for president.\par \par \uc2 Moffatt played catch-up from the start. He had 14 people working for him in the primaries and then, around May 1, he submitted a general election plan that required at least 110 people and would eventually have 160. Obama was far ahead. Moffatt recalled his assign-ment in daunting terms: "Can we do 80 percent of what the Obama campaign is doing, in 20 percent of the time, at 10 percent of the cost?"\par \par \uc2 Moffatt's team nonetheless managed to create big projects on short notice. For example, one of the highest priorities was a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  app that would -enable the Romney campaign to locate voters who otherwise could not be found by telephone. By some estimates, half of younger voters do not have a landline or cannot be reached by cellphone. Three weeks before Election Day, the app was unveiled by the campaign and downloaded by 40,000 Romney supporters.\par \par \uc2 There was only one problem. Months earlier, Obama's campaign had developed a similar app, which had been downloaded by 1 million people.\par \par \uc2 Defining Romney\par \par \uc2 David Axelrod, Obama's -senior strategist, felt he had been given a gift.\par \par \uc2 For months, he had worried that the Romney campaign would find a way to present its candidate in a compelling fashion. But as far as Axelrod could tell, the Romney campaign had no such strategy.\par \par \uc2 "I questioned why they didn't spend more time and -energy early defining Romney in a fuller way so people could identify with him," Axelrod said in a postelection interview.\par \par \uc2 "One of my conclusions is so much of his life was kind of walled off from use. His faith is important to him, but they didn't want to talk about that. His business was important, but they didn't want to talk about that much. His governorship was important to him, but his signature achievement [health care] was unhelpful to them in the Republican primary. My feeling is you have to build a candidacy on the foundation of biography. That is what authenticates your message. I was always waiting for that happen."\par \par \uc2 Axelrod jumped at the opening. In a major gamble, the Obama campaign moved $65 million in advertising money that had been budgeted for September and October into June, enabling the president to unleash a series of attacks that would define Romney at a time when the Republican would have little money to respond.\par \par \uc2 From Axelrod's viewpoint, the timing was perfect. Romney had been weakened by assaults from fellow GOP candidates during the primaries. Romney alienated many Hispanics by suggesting that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families should "self- deport," and he said he had been a "severely conservative" governor, hurting his strategy to move to the middle for the general election.\par \par \uc2 The candidate's life\par \par \uc2 Beth Myers, one of -Romney's top advisers, had a nagging worry. Obama's campaign was running ads in markets such as suburban Virginia designed to appeal to women voters. Myers wondered if the Romney campaign should -invest in a direct response.\par \par \uc2 "I wish I had expressed my deep concern more vociferously at that point; this was May, June, when they really went on the offense," Myers said. "I -remember thinking, 'This bothers me.' "\par \par \uc2 That worry was a window into greater concerns about how the Romney campaign was handling its advertising money.\par \par \uc2 In campaign postmortems, Republicans have been criticized for spending too much on advertising compared with Democrats, even as some -reports said Obama was able to book television spots more cheaply, run more ads in key states, and reach key voters more effectively.\par \par \uc2 The Obama campaign used a program called "the -optimizer" that linked data from its voter databases, focus groups, and television ratings to determine how to reach people who do not typically see campaign ads. As a result, Obama purchased ads on channels such as TV Land and Hallmark that were watched by voters who rarely saw news programs where ads often appear.\par \par \uc2 Stevens said the criticism of the Romney ad strategy is misguided. When advertising by the campaigns is compared, he said, Obama spent twice as much as Romney.\par \par \uc2 In any case, as Romney continued to run negative ads, the pressure mounted from -Romney's family and friends to tell more about his life as the GOP convention approached.\par \par \uc2 Ann Romney, who had long pushed for more focus on her husband's personal story, made her point directly in a convention video: "If you really want to know how a person will operate, look at how they've lived their life." A Vermont couple -appeared on the convention stage to tell the emotional story of how Romney, as a Mormon leader, helped their dying 14-year-old son, David Oparowski, write his will. "How many men do you know would take the time out of their busy lives to visit a terminally ill 14-year-old and help him settle his affairs?" Pat Oparowski, the boy's mother, said in her speech.\par \par \uc2 But Romney's campaign, still concerned about highlighting Mormonism and taking the focus away from the economy, arranged for the testimonial and an accompanying video to come before commercial television networks broadcast the proceedings. Instead, prime-time viewers saw Clint Eastwood pretending to talk to Obama in an empty chair.\par \par \uc2 47 percent\par \par \uc2 Shortly after Romney wrapped up the nomination, he stopped by for a conversation with Myers to discuss an idea that he believed would be the key to winning the presidency. He called it the Manhattan Project.\par \par \uc2 Named after the government program to build the atomic bomb, the Manhattan Project was designed to turn a perceived weakness -- Romney's much-anticipated matchup with Obama in the fall debates -- into the campaign's greatest strength.\par \par \uc2 So Romney proposed months of intense preparation, with 16 mock debates. (Obama did 11.) Then, just as Romney seemed ready, the campaign -received news that a video had been leaked in which the candidate characterized 47 percent of Americans as "victims" who wanted government benefits and would never vote for him. That left the impression that Romney was referring not just to people on welfare but also to recipients of Social Security and veterans benefits. It seemed to confirm the worst view of -Romney, that he didn't care about average people. His poll numbers plummeted.\par \par \uc2 If the Manhattan Project was ever needed, it was now.\par \par \uc2 Obama unprepared\par \par \uc2 Obama played right into the strategy. After some lethargic rehearsals, in which Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts played the Romney role, Obama never mentioned the 47 percent controversy during the first debate. The president skipped at least two practice sessions at which he was going to review material. Obama seemed as unready as Romney was ready. "This was an exposure of Mitt Romney that people hadn't seen before," said -Newhouse. "He had been a caricature who'd outsourced jobs, offshored jobs. The Mitt -Romney they saw in debates was articulate, thoughtful, and had a plan." Romney's rating went up by 9 points in some key states, although that subsided as Obama performed strongly in the subsequent two debates.\par \par \uc2 Romney's aides were gleeful. They had -- fortuitously, it now seemed -- made a strategic -decision to spend heavily on October advertising, the opposite of the Obama campaign's -approach.\par \par \uc2 This surprised Axelrod, who questioned what he called Romney's "backloaded" ad strategy, saying he could not think of a single effective ad in any presidential campaign that began airing after Labor Day.\par \par \uc2 Stevens, however, thought money for late advertising was important. "It was a hard decision," Stevens said at a post- election seminar at Harvard's Institute of Politics, "but we - enjoyed spending that money in October."\par \par \uc2 Like the Alamo\par \par \uc2 Tagg Romney could not figure it out. Why had Obama spent so heavily during the primaries when he had no primary opponent? Only later did Tagg realize this was a key to Obama's victory.\par \par \uc2 "We were looking at all the money they were spending in the primary and we were thinking 'what are they spending all their money on? They're wasting a lot of money.' They weren't. They were paying staffers in Florida" and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 If Romney's Manhattan Project had been debate preparation, then Obama's was the ground game.\par \par \uc2 Building on its 2008 field organ-ization, Obama's campaign had far more people on the ground, for longer periods, and backed by better data. In Florida, for example, the -Romney campaign said it had fewer than 200 staff members on the ground, a huge commitment of its total of 500 nationwide. But the Obama campaign had 770 staff in Florida out of 3,000 or so nationwide.\par \par \uc2 "They had more staff in Florida than we had in the country, and for longer," said Romney adviser Ron Kaufman.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, in swing state after swing state, the Obama field team was much bigger than the Romney troops. Obama had 123 offices in Ohio, compared with Romney's 40. Obama had 59 offices in Colorado, compared with Romney's 15, accord-ing to statistics compiled by the Obama campaign.\par \par \uc2 Stevens said he expressed alarm about the Democrat's early advantage in money and staff. He said Obama's decision to reject public financing for the fall campaign (a move Romney followed) worked to Obama's advantage -because Obama used primary funds to prepare for the general election, and it meant there was no ceiling on how much could be spent.\par \par \uc2 "It is like sitting in the -Alamo," Stevens said in the postelection interview, comparing the siege by Mexican troops in 1836 to competing against the superior forces of the Obama campaign. "Yes, it is alarming. There are a lot of Santa Anna's soldiers out there."\par \par \uc2 Ground game\par \par \uc2 Romney's confidence remained strong as Election Day approached. While public polls showed Obama in control, some of Romney's internal polls showed him winning.\par \par \uc2 But Obama's field organization was too strong. In Florida, 266,000 more Hispanics voted than four years earlier. "They altered the face of the election by driving up the Latino turnout," Romney political director Rich Beeson said. "They told us they would do it. I didn't think they would do it, and they did."\par \par \uc2 Ohio was the greatest surprise of all. Romney pollster Neil Newhouse calculated that 209,000 more African-Americans voted this year than in 2008 in Ohio, while 329,000 fewer whites had voted.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know how that's possible," Newhouse said. "If that is what the Obama campaign achieved, hats off to them."\par \par \uc2 A key difference was the depth of voter contact. Romney took comfort in polls that showed voters had been contacted equally by both campaigns. But the polls were misleading, perhaps equating a recorded robocall on the phone with a house call by a worker.\par \par \uc2 "It wasn't well understood what they were doing," Newhouse said. "We asked the question in polls, 'Have you been contacted by campaigns?' Our overall contact was pretty similar. But their in- person contact was beating us by 3 to 2."\par \par \uc2 Kevin Madden, a longtime Romney confidant who served as a spokesman in the final months of the campaign, said that he regrets that the campaign did not adhere to what worked for Republicans in 2004, when \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  won reelection with an innovative ground game.\par \par \uc2 "We were in position of arguing against something that I had seen proven correct in 2004," Madden said. "We have to remember that the nature of campaigns has changed. We did it in right in 2004 and we have lost a step."\par \par \uc2 System failure\par \par \uc2 As dawn broke on Election Day, 800 Romney volunteers filled the floor of TD Garden in Boston. This was the centerpiece of the campaign's turnout operation, code named ORCA, that was supposed to swallow Obama's Narwhal program. But the Romney team was so determined to keep ORCA secret that it had never run a test at TD Garden; it had only gone through some lesser runs in a different building.\par \par \uc2 The ORCA workers were supposed to be in contact with more than 30,000 volunteers stationed at polling places across the country. Those volunteers were told to bring a smartphone and go to a secure Web page on which they could report the names of everyone who voted. In this way, the Romney campaign could determine if supporters had failed to show up and urge them to vote.\par \par \uc2 But as volunteers on Election Day began tapping in the names of voters, it became clear something was wrong.\par \par \uc2 The system was so overloaded with incoming data from volunteers that it exceeded capacity and crashed.\par \par \uc2 The Obama campaign, which had suffered a similar meltdown in 2008 and had been zealous about testing its systems this time around, had no glitches. Tens of thousands of Obama volunteers across the country sent real-time data from polling places, enabling workers at Chicago headquarters to ensure that expected vote totals were on track. More importantly, the field organization put in place by Jeremy Bird hit its goals, turning out the needed number of voters to reelect the president.\par \par \uc2 Call the president\par \par \uc2 As Romney's campaign plane landed at Logan International Airport at around 6 p.m. on Election Day, he turned on his iPad and opened the Drudge Report. "Uh oh," someone said upon seeing reports of early exit polls. But Romney still had hope.\par \par \uc2 Arriving at his suite in the Westin Boston Waterfront -hotel, Romney received regular updates from his staff. He made small talk about the Patriots and the Celtics and played with his grandchildren. He was about to concede around 11:15 p.m when Republican strategist Karl Rove made his now- infamous appearance on Fox News Channel, insisting that his own network was wrong in calling Ohio for the president.\par \par \uc2 The concession call was canceled, followed by an hour of uncertainty. Then, after Fox -executives dismissed Rove's concerns and stood by the network's projection, Romney said: Call the president.\par \par \uc2 Lessons learned\par \par \uc2 Exit polls told a stunning story. The majority of voters preferred Romney's visions, values, and leadership. But he had clearly failed to address the problem that Romney's own family worried about from the start. Obama beat Romney by an astonishing 81 to 18 percent margin on the question of which candidate "cares about people like me."\par \par \uc2 That finding still frustrates those closest to Romney. His former lieutenant governor, \uc2 Kerry Healey\uc2 , who believed the campaign wasted an opportunity to highlight Romney's life at the convention, said, "even at the end of the campaign, I never felt that the American people understood Mitt Romney's genuine character and that is a terrible shame."\par \par \uc2 Romney, who did not respond to an interview request, was ultimately responsible for his campaign's failings. Republicans variously blamed factors such as a candidate who was too moderate or not moderate enough, a lower-than-expected turnout of white voters for Romney coupled with a heavy minority vote for Obama, and the president's leadership during the Sandy storm.\par \par \uc2 Inevitably, much of the blame has been directed at -Stevens, and he hasn't ducked it. "If there's blame to be thrown, throw it my way," he said. But he said it should be noted that Obama had no primary opponents, giving him an enormous advantage.\par \par \uc2 In the coming months, -Romney, ever the data-driven analyst, plans to contemplate how his political life came to an end, and what the party should do next, according to his son Tagg. The fight for the ideological soul of the party will play out for months. But recommendations are already pouring in for the party to create a ground-game infrastructure long before a nominee is selected, to catch up to the Democratic advantage in high-tech turnout operations, and to find ways to make the party more inclusive for minorities and women.\par \par \uc2 Romney himself will make the case to the party for many such changes, according to Tagg.\par \par \uc2 "Having been through it, you know so much more than when you haven't," Tagg said.\par \par \uc2 Michael Kranish can be reached at kranish@globe.com.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Globe's three-part series, "Justice in the shadows," shined a bright light on the system that has been set up to process tens of thousands of immigrants who are rounded up for the crime of being in this country without proper documentation. Unlike other crimes, this one doesn't come with the usual set of rights and guarantee of procedural fairness: In setting up mechanisms to deal with non- Americans, the United States seemed to go out of its way to insist that its highest principles apply only to its citizens and properly documented visitors. Far too often, families are torn apart and detainees are shut off from legal help and communication with loved ones.\par \par \uc2 Taxpayers pay billions of dollars for this shadow world, but based on extensive reporting by the Globe's Maria Sacchetti and Milton Valencia, it does little to enhance security or keep people from entering the country without proper documentation. More daylight is needed, not only to address incidents of injustice, but also to police instances in which immigration authorities lack the legal levers necessary to keep dangerous people off the streets.\par \par \uc2 According to the Globe's investigation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- the federal agency known as ICE -- detains more than 10,000 immigrants every day who are in the country illegally, but have committed no other crime. Once apprehended, they can be held for weeks and sometimes months in jails where they have fewer rights than criminals. There are no guaranteed hearings prior to lockup and no guaranteed access to counsel. Some people are eventually deported. Others remain in custody, unable to get the medical treatment they need, and some die under agonizing conditions.\par \par \uc2 The Globe also found that the system careens from too harsh to too lenient. ICE releases thousands of criminals -- including murderers -- back onto US streets because their home countries won't take them back.\par \par \uc2 For years, many Democrats and Republicans talked about the need for immigration reform, but were thwarted by political extremists who decried any show of tolerance or leniency. The message sent by Latino voters in the recent presidential election could change that. When Congress takes up comprehensive immigration reform, as leaders of both parties have said they will do in the spring, detention reform should be included.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 , which is pressing the case for detainees across the country, believes the following elements, among others, should be part of any comprehensive immigration reform legislation:\par \par \uc2 * Detention should be the last resort. An alternative process should be put in place to deal with illegal immigrants, if a person is not a danger to society or a flight risk.\par \par \uc2 * Before any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is locked up, the government must justify the case for detention at a bond hearing.\par \par \uc2 * Judges weighing deportation orders should have the discretion to consider individual hardship on a case-by-case basis.\par \par \uc2 But the law doesn't have to change for the system to improve. The Obama administration could use its discretion to review the necessity of holding people indefinitely, and splitting up families. Without any change to the law, the government could require a bond hearing to establish if the person is dangerous or a flight risk; if not, that person could be released, pending further action.\par \par \uc2 Most immigrants who are in this country illegally are not dangerous criminals. Many have lived here for a long time. They have hopes, dreams, and children. Their goal is to become citizens of a country they believe offers the greatest opportunities. Giving them a way to stay in the country legally, with a path to citizenship, is one goal of comprehensive immigration reform. But making sure they are treated fairly and humanely when and if they are held for lacking documentation should be another goal. And Congress should give ICE the power to hold dangerous criminals even if their own countries won't take them back. The vagaries of the detention system are, at bottom, urgent testimony of the need to modernize the whole way that illegal immigration is handled in this country.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020121217e8ch0000k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Democrat and Republican lawmakers in Congress are calling for federal legislation that would compel the US State Department to play "hardball" and deny diplomatic visas to nations that block deportation of thousands of foreign criminals, many of whom are -released to US streets instead.\par \par \uc2 Representative Ted Poe, a -Republican from Texas, said members of both parties are dispatching staff to a meeting Friday to try to advance legislation he filed last year requiring the State Department to sanction more than 20 countries that routinely stall deportations of their citizens.\par \par \uc2 The Globe reported Sunday that federal immigration officials have released more than 8,500 convicted murderers, rapists, and other violent criminals since 2008, including as many as 10 convicted murderers in New England and 201 nationwide, -because their home countries did not take them back.\par \par \uc2 Current law allows the State Department to deny visas, which allow entry to the United States, to nations that refuse to take back convicted criminals. But since 2001, officials have only used that power against -tiny Guyana in South America.\par \par \uc2 "The State Department doesn't enforce the law," Poe said in a speech Wednesday on the House floor that an aide said was inspired by the Globe series, "Justice in the Shadows." "We need to get these people out of our country . . . and these countries need to take them back, or there ought to be a consequence."\par \par \uc2 Federal immigration officials say they have to release the criminals because they cannot deport them without a passport or other travel papers, and the Supreme Court has ruled they cannot hold them longer than six months if deportation is unlikely. But Poe and others say the US government can do more to prod countries to - accept their own citizens.\par \par \uc2 Poe's bill would require the State Department to deny visas to embassy and consular support staff if they do not accept the criminals within 90 days. He said the bill would affect countries such as China, Jamaica, Pakistan, Cuba, and Vietnam, which refused to take a Massachusetts man paroled -after serving about 20 years for helping to kill an Everett girl and her mother in 1989.\par \par \uc2 Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Immigration Policy and Enforcement Subcommittee, said Wednesday that she is working with Poe on legislation that would impose sanctions without being too broad. She said delays in deportation are sometimes warranted, recalling a case in which France refused to accept a mentally ill woman who was not one of their citizens.\par \par \uc2 "There are occasions when the government refusing to take the person are right," she said.\par \par \uc2 But she said withholding diplomatic visas to embassy and consular staff should compel countries to take back their citizens. "We'd like to actually get this done," she said. "Believe me, that will be noticed, and that will hurt."\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether the legislation would pass, let alone get out of committee, given the serious political implications of denying diplomatic visas to powerful nations such as -China, one of the countries that are slow to accept criminals.\par \par \uc2 But Poe, on the House floor, quoted the Globe article to show that the matter was a safety issue. He recounted the horrific murder of Qian Wu, 46, a New York woman who was bludgeoned and stabbed to death in January 2010, by an -\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from China who was supposed to have been deported.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Wu's death did not have to occur," Poe said. "This crime could have actually been prevented. Chen should not have been back on the streets after serving time in prison, but he was."\par \par \uc2 Besides sanctions, Poe's bill also requires the Department of Homeland Security to notify state and local law enforcement of a criminal's release "as soon as is practicable."\par \par \uc2 But Poe's legislation does not require immigration officials to notify crime victims of the -release of criminals. The Globe found that the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcment, the Homeland Security agency that detains and deports immigrants, has released or deport-ed more than 1 million criminals in the past decade, but they have notified only 1,000 to 3,000 victims.\par \par \uc2 Poe said he was unaware that victims were not notified and may add such a requirement to the current bill or -future legislation. "Of all people on earth that want to know when a person's released, it's the victim," he said.\par \par \uc2 Lofgren said she, too, was unaware that victims were not notified. "If you think that the person who victimized you is safely locked up someplace, there are precautions you may not take," she said. "That strikes me as quite wrong."\par \par \uc2 Federal immigration officials said they detain immigrants only for civil immigration violations, not crimes, and typically after the immigrants' sentence has been served. Still, immigration officials said they notify victims when they sign up for their program.\par \par \uc2 The bipartisan effort comes as Congress and President Obama are gearing up next year for a massive overhaul of the federal immigration system.\par \par \uc2 On the House floor, Poe said, "It's no secret that everybody believes our immigration system is broken," but he said - Republicans and Democrats could come together to address the issue of releasing criminals now.\par \par \uc2 Lofgren agreed. "Even when Ted Poe and I probably don't agree on hundreds of items, that doesn't mean that you can't work together on something we agree on that's good for the country," she said.\par \par \uc2 The release of foreign criminals is one of multiple findings in a three-day Globe investigation into the secrecy surrounding ICE and its sister agencies, which operate with little public scrutiny despite having emerged as the largest law enforce-ment network in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Maria Sacchetti can be reached at msacchetti@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020121213e8cd0001t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FLUSHING, N.Y. -- Qian Wu thought the man who brutally attacked her was gone forever.\par \par \uc2 She was sure that Huang Chen, a Chinese citizen who slipped into America on a ship and stayed in the country illegally, would be deported as soon as he got out of jail for choking, punching, and pointing a knife at her in 2006.\par \par \uc2 But China refused to take Chen back. So, after jailing Chen on and off for three years in Texas, immigration officials believed they were out of options and did what they have done with thousands of criminals like him.\par \par \uc2 They quietly let him go.\par \par \uc2 Nobody warned Wu, or prosecutors, or the public. The petite, 46- year-old woman learned Chen was still here when he stormed into her unlocked apartment one day in January 2010 and announced, "I bet you didn't expect to see me." Terrified, she called the police, and he fled. But for two weeks, Chen was free to stalk her and finally, to catch her as she hurried home with milk and bread one afternoon.\par \par \uc2 Chen then finished what he had started earlier, bashing Wu on the head with a hammer and slashing her with a knife. As she lay crumpled in a grimy stairwell, he ripped out her heart and a lung and fled with his macabre trophies.\par \par \uc2 "She lived in horror in the last two weeks of her life," said Yongwei Guo, Wu's widower, through an interpreter in New York. "She knew there was somebody coming to kill her and we asked the police for protection, and also the government, but they did nothing."\par \par \uc2 Wu is just one casualty of an immigration system cloaked in a blanket of secrecy that the Founding Fathers could not have imagined, a blanket that isn't lifted even when life is at risk. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its sister agencies have emerged as the largest law enforcement network in the United States since the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and they are increasingly dealing with criminals, but they play by very different rules than the local police, prosecutors, or even the \uc2 FBI\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A yearlong Globe investigation found the culture of secrecy can be deadly to Americans and foreigners alike: Immigration officials do not notify most crime victims when they release a criminal such as Chen, and they only notify local law enforcement on a case by case basis. And even though immigration officials have the power to try to hold dangerous people longer, that rarely occurs.\par \par \uc2 The Globe also found that the pattern of secrecy extends to the treatment of immigrants who end up behind bars, though they have no criminal records. Foreigners in immigration detention have fewer rights than ordinary criminal suspects and limited ability to get word to the outside world about their plight. Even their names are kept secret, purportedly for their own protection, and many never get a public hearing to make their case.\par \par \uc2 Taken together, the system produces a litany of consequences: A young Lynn woman with no criminal record died in immigration custody from a heart ailment without a chance to ask a judge for medical help; a father of five in Texas disappeared from his family for several days after he was detained; a Cuban man in a wheelchair languished for an extraordinary 14 years in immigration detention, invisible to the world outside.\par \par \uc2 It is also a system in which -- as Wu would learn in her final days of terror -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, routinely releases dangerous detainees to the streets of America without warning the public. Over the past four years, immigration officials have largely without notice freed more than 8,500 detainees convicted of murder, rape, and other crimes, according to ICE's own statistics, mainly because their home countries would not take them back.\par \par \uc2 Deporting illegal immigrants requires more than simply putting them on an airplane to their own country. People being deported need travel papers -- such as a passport -- like anyone else who travels abroad. If their native country refuses to issue the necessary papers, the United States cannot send deportees there. And the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  has said ICE cannot hold the immigrants forever; if immigration officials cannot deport them after six months, the court said, they should generally set the immigrants free.\par \par \uc2 When the Globe requested the names of the released criminals under the Freedom of Information Act, federal immigration officials refused, saying it would be a "clearly unwarranted invasion" of the immigrants' privacy. Officials said public interest in their names was "minimal" anyway.\par \par \uc2 "In the absence of any identified public interest or explanation as to how the disclosure of the arrestees' information will advance that interest, the personal privacy interests will prevail," Matthew Chandler, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration, said in a written statement to the Globe.\par \par \uc2 But a disturbing number of foreigners have been arrested after their release, including some for heinous crimes. Abel Arango, an armed robber who was released when his native Cuba wouldn't take him back, shot and killed a Fort Myers, Fla., police officer who responded to a report of a loud fight between Arango and his girlfriend in 2008. Binh Thai Luc, an armed robber from Vietnam, couldn't be deported either, so he was released. In March, he allegedly massacred five people in a San Francisco home.\par \par \uc2 McCarthy Larngar, a Liberian national who served several years in prison for shooting and wounding a man in Rhode Island, was released in 2007 when Liberia would not take him back -- even though a Boston immigration official had described him in court records as "a danger to the community." After multiple brushes with the law, Larngar was arrested last year and charged with tying up and robbing a man and a woman in a bizarre kidnapping in Pawtucket. His lawyer said in court documents that he is not guilty, and he is now in a Rhode Island jail on a violation from an earlier crime.\par \par \uc2 In New England, immigration officials have released as many as 10 convicted murderers since 2008.\par \par \uc2 They include Hung Truong, a robber who repeatedly stabbed a bound and gagged 15-year-old Everett girl during a 1989 kidnapping that left the girl and her mother dead. Massachusetts released Truong on parole about 20 years into his life prison sentence in hopes that he would be deported to his native Vietnam in 2010. But ICE could not deport him because Vietnam has refused to accept deportees who came to the United States before 1995.\par \par \uc2 Now, he's back in prison after failing a drug test that was part of his release deal with the state Parole Board.\par \par \uc2 As part of its investigation, the Globe filed more than 20 different public records requests to obtain more detailed information about the people held -- and released -- by the immigration system. Many requests were rejected or the responses were heavily censored, prompting the Globe to file a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security in November. But this much is clear from the available documents: Federal officials are releasing people that they regard as dangerous and doing little to force recalcitrant countries to take their citizens back.\par \par \uc2 More than 20 governments from Jamaica to China routinely block deportation of their citizens, even dodging calls from US immigration officers seeking to expedite the process, and critics say they suffer few consequences. Some, such as US Representative Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, argue that the United States should stop accepting diplomats from countries who do not repatriate their citizens, but the State Department has shown little interest, preferring to work through diplomatic channels to deport immigrants. Federal officials have refused to issue visas to only one nation, tiny Guyana in South America.\par \par \uc2 Even when foreigners cannot be deported, immigration officials, under a 2001 \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling, could seek to hold them longer on the grounds that they are a danger to the public. Immigration officials say the legal standard for holding an immigrant longer for that reason is very high, limiting their ability to use it. They point out that immigrants are detained for civil immigration violations and not crimes.\par \par \uc2 But the Globe found that immigration officials almost never try to declare a detainee dangerous: In the past four years, immigration officials have released thousands of criminals, but court officials say they have handled only 13 cases seeking to hold immigrants longer because they are dangerous.\par \par \uc2 Too dangerous to release\par \par \uc2 Immigration agent Earl DeLong and his colleagues wasted little time in trying to put Shafiqul Islam on a plane back to his native Bangladesh two years ago. As soon as he finished his prison term in New York for taking pictures of himself sexually abusing a 12-year- old girl when he was 17, immigration agents called the Bangladeshi consulate in Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 Initially, the Bangladeshis were reassuring and a consular official, Mamunur Rashid, said he sent the agent's request for clearance to deport Islam to authorities in Dhaka. But as time dragged on, the cooperation waned.\par \par \uc2 Whenever DeLong and others called the consulate over the next few months, Rashid was increasingly unavailable. The receptionist said he was not in. He was on vacation or out to lunch. Sometimes, a person at the consulate answered the phone and just hung up. Other times, the phone rang but nobody answered.\par \par \uc2 "Spoke to a person at the consulate four different times, never able to speak with Mamunur Rashid," one agent wrote in a secret federal log that became public as part of a lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 US officials had seen stalling tactics from Bangladesh before: The impoverished Asian nation typically took several months to provide passports for criminals being deported last year -- if they provided the documents at all, according to federal statistics.\par \par \uc2 Foreign countries are understandably reluctant to accept criminals, especially those such as Islam who were raised in the United States, and they have little incentive to do so since the United States rarely takes action against them, such as refusing to issue them visas.\par \par \uc2 State Department officials acknowledge that they try to avoid reaching the point of sanctions with nations like Bangladesh, but insist that they do apply diplomatic pressure.\par \par \uc2 "It is a matter we take very seriously, and consistently raise it at high levels with all countries where this is a concern," said department spokesman Ken Chavez.\par \par \uc2 Hoping Bangladesh would clear Islam's return, US immigration officials told Islam in April 2011 that they were going to continue to hold him even though more than six months had passed since Islam's sexual abuse sentence ended. Islam responded with a lawsuit, charging that immigration could not continue to detain him because it was unlikely that Bangladesh would take him back. In the lawsuit, he pointedly noted that the consulate appeared to be dodging the immigration agent's calls.\par \par \uc2 Islam's lawsuit made public a host of immigration documents that are normally kept secret. The documents revealed both immigration officials' concerns that Islam is dangerous and their frustrating attempts to contact the Bangladeshis.\par \par \uc2 But there is no evidence in the file that immigration officials requested an immigration court hearing to determine if they could continue to hold him as a threat to public safety.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the records show that on Oct. 3, 2011, immigration officials gave up and released Islam.\par \par \uc2 Seven weeks later, Islam was at Lois Decker's door.\par \par \uc2 Everyone loved the retired school lunch lady, a friendly 73-year- old grandmother who taught Sunday school and lived her whole life in Hillsdale, N.Y., a rural hamlet just across the border from the Massachusetts line. Decker raised five children, but she lived alone in the house her daughter bought for her on Cold Water Street.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff's deputies say they are unsure what drew Islam to Decker's house that day, but family members said she had planned to rent out an apartment in the basement. Islam had a construction job in the Berkshires.\par \par \uc2 Hours after Islam visited Decker's house, police arrested him in a traffic stop in a nearby city. He had stolen Decker's white Hyundai, crashed it, and then tried to steal the truck of good Samaritans who had stopped to help him. He finally stole yet another truck, but did not get far. When police arrested him, he was spattered with blood, and had Decker's credit card in the truck.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff's deputies discovered a gruesome scene at Lois Decker's house. The woman had been strangled, court records showed, and her face and throat were slashed. Officials found Islam's semen on a sheet in the house, though officials did not find bodily evidence that Decker was sexually assaulted.\par \par \uc2 Columbia County officials were incensed and demanded to know why ICE had let such a dangerous person go free. They had convicted the high school dropout on sex abuse charges in 2008. Now he's serving 20 years to life for Decker's murder.\par \par \uc2 Paul Czajka, the silver-haired district attorney and a former judge in Columbia County, said immigration officials should have argued that Islam was dangerous enough to hold longer.\par \par \uc2 "He was a child abuser and registered sex offender, therefore by definition he was a danger to the community," said Czajka. "It would not have been a difficult hearing to make that case."\par \par \uc2 But ICE spokesman Ross Feinstein said the agency had little choice but to release criminals such as Islam and Chen because the courts have made it difficult to hold even mentally ill immigrants longer without new criminal charges against them.\par \par \uc2 "For this reason, the agency's ability to utilize the continued detention of removable aliens . . . is extremely limited," Feinstein said.\par \par \uc2 Lois Decker's grieving relatives say they've been told very little about how Islam gained his release and was able to kill her. Until a Globe reporter contacted the family, they had no idea that Islam had filed a federal lawsuit to get out of jail.\par \par \uc2 "It's crazy to me that we don't know this information," said Decker's daughter Diane Demarest, a veterinarian who lives in Oregon.\par \par \uc2 Some US and Bangladeshi officials involved with Islam's case did not even realize he had killed Decker until contacted by the Globe.\par \par \uc2 Gail Y. Mitchell, an assistant US attorney in New York who defended ICE against Islam's lawsuit to get out of jail, said the case ended because immigration officials released him. She would not say why they didn't pursue the case and did not know that Islam had gone on to murder Decker.\par \par \uc2 Bangladesh consul M. Shahedul Islam said he did not know that Islam had killed Decker either. "This guy?" the consul said, raising his eyebrows and pointing to four passport-sized photos of Islam in a file with letters from US immigration officials asking for help with deportation.\par \par \uc2 The Bangladeshi consulate said Bangladesh did not approve Islam for return because they could not verify he was a citizen of their country.\par \par \uc2 "We always cooperate with \uc2 Homeland Security\uc2 ," said the consul, who is not related to Shafiqul Islam, and he apologized if his staff hung up on ICE agents.\par \par \uc2 But, for Decker's family, the conflicting explanations don't help.\par \par \uc2 "How could someone not have stopped him along the way?" asked Demarest.\par \par \uc2 Light sentences for heavy crimes\par \par \uc2 The uncertainties of the deportation process have another little known effect: Some foreigners get reduced prison sentences when they are convicted of crimes because judges believe they are sure to be deported after their sentence is over. Federal immigration officials warn against the practice, saying that deportation is not a 100 percent certainty even for the worst offender.\par \par \uc2 No one knows that better than the man Antonino Rodrigues allegedly shot between the eyes this year.\par \par \uc2 Rodrigues, a convicted drug dealer in the country illegally from Cape Verde, was facing almost four years in federal prison in October 2010 for possessing a stolen, loaded weapon. New Bedford police had caught him: They knew Rodrigues had outstanding arrest warrants and they were pleased when a detective spotted him bar- hopping on the city's south side.\par \par \uc2 When Rodrigues appeared for sentencing before US District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock in Boston for the latest in a string of convictions, federal guidelines called for 37 to 46 months in prison.\par \par \uc2 But defense lawyer Syrie Fried argued that Rodrigues deserved a lighter punishment because he was going to deported anyway. She told the judge Rodrigues had "no prospect of release back into our society."\par \par \uc2 Woodlock went along, giving Rodrigues just two years in prison with credit for time served, clearing the way for Rodrigues to finish his prison sentence in March 2011.\par \par \uc2 "Given the defendant's near certainty of deportation, the sentence is sufficient but not greater than necessary," the judge ruled.\par \par \uc2 But Cape Verde officials did not take Rodrigues back, so immigration officials released him late last year. The Cape Verde consulate in Boston did not respond to questions about why they did not accept Rodrigues.\par \par \uc2 On June 17, 2012, Rodrigues resurfaced outside an apartment on New Bedford's Walnut Street, where police say he shot Monzes Goncalves in the forehead with a .22-caliber gun. Goncalves miraculously survived and identified Rodrigues as the shooter.\par \par \uc2 Rodrigues denied shooting Goncalves and turned himself in to police because he heard they were looking for him.\par \par \uc2 Fried, the lawyer who helped Rodrigues win a shorter prison sentence in 2010, said she was surprised to learn that her client was still in the United States. She said she did not stay in touch with him because, typically, foreigners who are convicted of serious crimes leave the country.\par \par \uc2 "I was under the impression . . . that he was going to go straight from serving his jail sentence and be deported," she said.\par \par \uc2 The fact is, Rodrigues' case is not unusual. In Massachusetts over the past four years, the Parole Board has granted early release to 22 immigrants convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter, several times stating that their willingness to free the prisoner was influenced by his expected departure from the United States. Some prisoners told the board they planned to leave voluntarily for a job in Sierra Leone or a place to live in Cambodia.\par \par \uc2 However, at least five of the 22 were still here as of July, and, it's unclear what happened to the other 17. One of the five still here under state supervision is Hung Truong, the Vietnamese national who helped murder an Everett mother and her daughter. Truong had been disciplined more than 30 times in prison, but the board said his behavior had improved -- and Truong was possibly leaving anyway.\par \par \uc2 "It is the judgment of the board that he should be paroled [to federal immigration officials] for possible deportation," wrote the parole board in its unanimous vote on Sept. 24, 2010.\par \par \uc2 More than two years later, Truong is still here -- in \uc2 MCI\uc2 - Shirley, a Massachusetts prison, after flunking a drug test he was required to take as a condition of his release.\par \par \uc2 No one has to tell Qian Wu's widower about immigrants getting light sentences for heavy crimes. Yongwei Guo's wife was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who prosecutors said was initially sentenced to only 30 days in prison for attacking her the first time. Immigration officials ultimately detained Huang Chen off and on for more than three years in hopes of deporting him, but it wasn't enough.\par \par \uc2 "They are not taking responsibility," Guo said. "They can't let such a dangerous man free merely because China won't take him."\par \par \uc2 No warning for victims\par \par \uc2 Long after her assailant went off to prison, Qian Wu kept an eye out for him in her Flushing, N.Y., neighborhood, scanning the crush of pedestrians flowing into the markets, the take-out joints, and the massage parlors nearby. She quizzed the fruit vendors on the street. Nobody had seen Huang Chen. Nonetheless, Wu kept a restraining order out against him -- just in case.\par \par \uc2 Wu had a tough exterior, but those close to her said her attitude masked her fear. She was thin and walked with a limp from injuries she suffered in a car accident years ago. She hardly spoke English, and she had fled political repression in China. And until she remarried in 2008, Wu was a woman on her own, running an employment service for immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "She was disabled, so she had to be tougher than the others," said Guo.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, on the other side of the country at a detention center in El Paso, federal officials were trying to figure out what to do with Chen, a man who could seem normal one moment and mentally unbalanced the next. Immigration officials continued to hold Chen for another year after his 30-day sentence ran out, holding out hope that China would take him back.\par \par \uc2 When that didn't happen, an immigration agent dropped Chen off at a local homeless shelter, in April 2008.\par \par \uc2 But just two months later, El Paso police arrested Chen after he punched two men in a plaza downtown. Then, just days after Chen got out of jail for the assaults, police arrested him again on a disorderly conduct charge for attacking a man on a bicycle right in front of them. Police described him as "a danger" to himself and others in their report.\par \par \uc2 Chen returned to the El Paso detention center to await deportation, but again China refused to take him back, so in October 2009, immigration officials again released him. This time, he made it clear that he wanted to get back to New York. He blamed Qian Wu for his troubles, court records later showed, and he knew exactly where to find her: Apartment 3F in a building on 40th Road.\par \par \uc2 When Chen walked through Wu's unlocked front door for the first time since 2006, she ran downstairs and begged neighbors to call 911. She asked police and prosecutors for help with a new restraining order, since hers had expired, but never managed to get one. Guo warned his wife to stay inside.\par \par \uc2 One desperate night, Guo recalled, he asked Wu what they should do, and she responded bitterly.\par \par \uc2 "She said we can just wait to die," he said.\par \par \uc2 Most victims, including Wu, have no idea that the criminal who victimized them has been released, based on a Globe analysis of ICE's little-known victim notification program and the number of immigrants released from its custody. Federal immigration statistics show ICE has released or deported more than 1 million criminals over the past decade, but they have made just 1,000 to 3,000 victim notifications.\par \par \uc2 Currently, only 336 crime victims are enrolled in ICE's program, compared with 2.2 million victims in the Justice Department's electronic notification system in 2010 alone.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials say they want more crime victims to sign up for their system, but it's up to the victims to register. Wu's widower was unsure whether she had been offered the opportunity to enroll, though he knows she would have been interested.\par \par \uc2 The Queens district attorney's office, which handled Chen's attacks on Wu, said they were not aware of Chen's release. ICE officials say they are under no obligation to contact law enforcement officials when civil immigration detainees are released, though they do so when officials request it.\par \par \uc2 In Flushing, court records show, Chen stalked the panicked Wu for days. He moved into the same building, a few doors down. He tried to reach through the metal gate on her door and unlock it. He even took the $200 her husband gave him to go away.\par \par \uc2 On Jan. 26, 2010, security camera footage showed Chen leaving Wu's building, his green sweater soaked in blood. Police arrested him at a local hospital seeking treatment for a hand wound.\par \par \uc2 Chen, now 50, made no secret in court that he wanted to kill Wu as revenge for his long stint in prison. Justice Richard L. Buchter called the murder "cold-blooded and grotesque," and especially senseless because Chen was not supposed to be here at all.\par \par \uc2 "I just -- I am just disturbed by what you told me regarding the fact that this person should have been deported and was not," said Buchter, who sentenced Chen to 27 to 29 years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Wu's widower has filed claims against ICE and multimillion- dollar lawsuits against the \uc2 New York City Police Department\uc2  and Chen.\par \par \uc2 From his offices in Times Square, lawyer George W. Clarke said Guo's case is one of the toughest he's had in years, because immigration officials provide so little information. They ask him questions he said they should answer, such as when they released Chen, and refuse to provide documents.\par \par \uc2 "They're not telling us anything," Clarke said. Later, he added: "I think it's just the immigration service doesn't want to be bothered or exposed to liability for releasing people who may be guilty of crimes and who have no right to be here, such as Huang Chen."\par \par \uc2 Officials at the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to e-mails and phone calls about Chen's case.\par \par \uc2 The whole experience has shaken the Rev. Bill Morton, an El Paso priest who gave Chen a cleaning job when he got out of detention and sometimes drove him to meetings with ICE. Over time, he became concerned about Chen's mental health and, looking back, he wonders why immigration officials didn't express similar concerns, or warn volunteers like him.\par \par \uc2 "I'm totally pro-immigrant, but I'm certainly not pro-ignorance or indifference where you're exposing criminal people or insane people on an unknowing public," Morton said. "That's not helping immigrants or the US or the person themselves."\par \par \uc2 Milton J. Valencia of the Globe staff and Globe correspondent Melanie Dostis contributed to this report.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Governor \uc2 Deval Patrick\uc2  said Monday that allowing certain young illegal immigrants to pay the lower resident rate for tuition and fees at state colleges and universities is just one piece in efforts to overhaul -immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 "It's a step in the right direction, but it's not a substitute for comprehensive immigration reform," -Patrick told reporters at the State House. "We still need that."\par \par \uc2 On Monday, he sent a letter to the Board of Higher Education direct-ing it to revise its policy -immediately to allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to pay resident rates if they meet all other requirements.\par \par \uc2 Patrick's decision comes five months after President Obama launched the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The initiative grants -immigrants age 30 and younger two-year deportation deferrals and work permits if they -arrived in the United States -before age 16, had a clean -record, and met other requirements. They also must pay a $465 fee.\par \par \uc2 The move set off a robust -debate on Beacon Hill and -beyond.\par \par \uc2 Representative Bradley H. Jones Jr., Republican leader of the Massachusetts House, blasted Patrick's decision.\par \par \uc2 "The implementation of in-state tuition rates for illegal - immigrants should be stopped immediately," Jones said in a statement. "Regardless of whether or not the governor and I agree on this issue, the topic at hand should be how best to provide an affordable education for all of Massachusetts' residents."\par \par \uc2 He accused the governor of trying to usurp the power of the Legislature by implementing the policy unilaterally.\par \par \uc2 Patrick's decision also drew criticism from a prominent Democrat. Senator \uc2 Richard Moore\uc2  of Uxbridge said he is worried that illegal immigrants might take slots at public colleges from students who are -legal residents of the state.\par \par \uc2 "Given the limitations on -access by taxpayers, it's a concern as to whether it's the right policy at this point in time," Moore said. "Are we going to add faculty? Are we going to add rooms?"\par \par \uc2 Moore also faulted the governor for imposing the policy rather than seeking the Legislature's approval.\par \par \uc2 The governor says he is on strong legal footing to act unilaterally. He said that because any resident of Massachusetts with a work permit is currently entitled to in-state tuition rates, his order merely clarifies that these young illegal immigrants, so long as they have a work permit, will be covered under that policy.\par \par \uc2 "Not every policy requires a legislative review," he said.\par \par \uc2 Patrick's announcement, -reported by the Globe Monday, dramatically slashes the cost of a college education for immigrants who until now had to pay out-of-state rates.\par \par \uc2 For example, the flagship University of Massachusetts Amherst costs $26,645 this year for nonresidents, compared with $13,230 for residents, while \uc2 Bunker Hill Community College\uc2  costs $5,640 this year for residents, compared with $13,880 for nonresidents. And Framingham State costs $8,080 for residents this year, compared with $14,160 for nonresidents.\par \par \uc2 "These are not outsiders; these are residents and taxpayers who pay their dues to Massachusetts," Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, said before hosting an annual Thanksgiving lunch celebrating new citizens at the State House.\par \par \uc2 Millona said the new federal program is a temporary fix until Congress passes a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system.\par \par \uc2 US Representative Michael Capuano, who spoke at the lunch, said he was hopeful changes to federal immigration law would be addressed in this congressional term, but problems must be faced in the meantime.\par \par \uc2 "We have a lot of mistakes we're trying to fix with Band-Aids." he said. "I hate the Band-Aid approach, but sometimes it's necessary."\par \par \uc2 Lieutenant Governor \uc2 Timothy P. Murray\uc2  said it made economic sense to help young -immigrants earn an education and a productive living after they attended public elementary and high schools. "It's making good on an investment so many of our taxpayers have -already made," Murray told the lunch crowd. "It's important that we realize the full payoff of that investment by allowing them to go on."\par \par \uc2 But Greg Serrao, an Andover resident with a child in college and one in high school, said the government should be focused on educating its citizens and making college affordable for them. He said he has seen friends take out loans, remortgage homes, get a second job, or tell a child they cannot go to the school of their choice because of tuition costs.\par \par \uc2 "To think that other people are going to get a significant - financial pass just doesn't seem right," Serrao said.\par \par \uc2 Maria Sacchetti of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Adriana Ferreira, a clerk at the Registry of Motor Vehicles in Watertown, was known in the local Brazilian community as someone who could "fix things." For a price, she told illegal immigrants, she could hook them up with driver's licenses or even prod federal immigration officials to get their loved ones out of custody, prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 Ferreira, 48, of Brighton, took in thousands of dollars between 2009 and 2011 and not once did she deliver, authorities said. When her clients confronted her, she threatened them by saying she would call police or \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  officials. In some instances, she did call.\par \par \uc2 But two clients turned the tables on her, contacting authorities and agreeing to participate in a sting operation, prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 Ferreira, who grew up in Brazil and became a naturalized citizen after arriving here in the mid-1980s, was arrested Friday morning at the Registry branch and summarily charged in Suffolk Superior Court with 27 larceny, bribery, and conspiracy charges stemming from the cases of five alleged victims.\par \par \uc2 After each charge was read, the defendant replied "not guilty, your honor."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say Ferreira admitted shortly after her arrest that she had defrauded as many as 30 people because, in her words, "money was easy."\par \par \uc2 During the arraignment, Michele Granda, assistant district attorney, held up a picture depicting Ferreira during an undercover sting on May, 16, 2011, counting several crisp bills that a client had allegedly given her as payment.\par \par \uc2 Authorities said Ferreira charged up to $4,100 per client and took in at least $8,600 in three years.\par \par \uc2 Ferreira's case marks the second time this year that a Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicle employee was charged in connection with an alleged driver's license scheme. In July, Vanessa Peguero, 27, of Leominster, was charged in connection with issuing driver's licenses from 2010 to 2012 to people who presented legitimate Puerto Rican identification that was not their own, in order to conceal their identities.\par \par \uc2 The Registry declined to comment on the case.\par \par \uc2 Prior to working at the RMV, Ferreira was an account clerk in Brighton Municipal Court from 2005 to 2008 and made $37,518.80 annually at the time of her resignation, according to court officials.\par \par \uc2 "We believe she used her prior employment in the Brighton [court] clerk's office to bolster her appearance of legal influence, but she is not charged with any offenses arising out of her employment there," said Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk district attorney's office.\par \par \uc2 Heloisa Galvao, executive director of the Brazilian Women's Group in Allston, said illegal immigrants are often victimized by such ruses.\par \par \uc2 "It's so easy to exploit someone who has been living in the shadows," she said in a telephone interview. "People become desperate, they want to live a normal life, and they will pay a lot of money to get that. Unfortunately, it's often a dishonest person they're working with, when a lawyer is what they need."\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said Ferreira never worked with anyone at that agency to seek legal recourse in a case involving an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Our message is simple -- America's legal immigration system is not for sale, and HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] will move aggressively against those who compromise the integrity of that system simply to enrich themselves," said Bruce M. Foucart, special agent in charge of the HSI field office in Boston.\par \par \uc2 In one case, according to Granda, Ferreira stole $4,100 from a woman seeking to get her husband out of custody on an immigration detainer. The wife learned of Ferreira through word-of-mouth, and made contact with her on July 21, 2009. After paying $2,100, the wife became suspicious when Ferreira allegedly requested $2,000 more. The wife went to State Police and agreed to wear a wire in a sting operation.\par \par \uc2 After the wife paid the additional $2,000, which was provided by investigators, Ferreira allegedly told her that her husband would be released from custody at his next court hearing, but that never happened. Instead, the husband accepted voluntary departure from the United States in November 2009 and flew to Brazil a month later.\par \par \uc2 In another case, Ferreira approached a Brazilian man at the RMV who was attempting to get a driver's license but did not have a Social Security number. She allegedly told him she could get the license for him.\par \par \uc2 The man paid her $1,100, and when he did not get the license, confronted Ferreira at her RMV window. She allegedly told him that she was not there to serve him but rather "to serve the American government."\par \par \uc2 Ferreira then allegedly closed her window and walked away.\par \par \uc2 Brian Ballou can be reached at bballou@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Caption: During the arraignment, the prosecutor presented a photo of Adriana Ferreira, taken during a 2011 sting operation.   \par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020121117e8bh0000o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Countryside Health Care of Milford became the town's first local employer Tuesday to sign on to the federal government's background checking program aimed at curbing the hiring of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The nonfprofit health care center follows the lead of the town of Milford, population 28,000, which is the only community in New England and one of just a dozen nationwide that has enrolled in the \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  Mutual Agreement between Government and Employers.\par \par \uc2 Milford officials signed the agreement with the US immigration agency in August and have since urged local businesses to follow suit. However, Countryside Health Care administrator Barry Chiler said the town never approached him about signing up. Instead, he read of the program through the newspaper.\par \par \uc2 "We thought it was a good way to find out if people were legal or not," said Chiler, adding that he does not expect the federal immigration authorities to find any problems with his workforce.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration has been a hot topic in Milford since a fatal drunken-driving accident in August 2011 involving an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Chiler said he dislikes the political connotation to joining the controversial program, which has been criticized by immigrant groups as being unfairly weighted against foreign-born workers. He said membership in the program will help his human resources department by providing online verification of the documents workers already are required to provide proving they are eligible to legally work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "What I don't like about the program is it appears to be so political," Chiler said. "I'm not anti-immigration at all. I just want to make it easier on our HR and let this little nursing home take care of its patients."\par \par \uc2 The health care center, with 180 employees, is a nonprofit, municipal, skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility with a town- appointed board of directors.\par \par \uc2 The federal program, established in 2006, has grown to 169 participants nationwide, and 61 more companies are undergoing training to join, according to Ross Feinstein a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 There are just six participants in the program in Massachusetts, including Milford and Morningside Health Care, Feinstein said. The others are Saints Medical Center, Zaim Law Firm and the Lowell Housing Authority, all in Lowell; and Aetna Fire Alarm Service Co. in Dorchester.\par \par \uc2 "It is my pleasure to welcome Countryside Health Care of Milford," said Bruce M. Foucart, special agent in charge of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit in Boston. "When employers make a commitment to hire and maintain a lawful workforce, it's good not only for their business, but for the community and the nation."\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020121114e8be00024\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 After years of frustration, immigration reform advocates believe the stars have aligned since Tuesday's election to give them the best shot in years at bringing millions of illegal immigrants out of the shadows and fixing an immigration system widely seen as inadequate for the modern economy.\par \par \uc2 President Obama's victory, fueled by massive support among Latino voters, has produced a new dynamic in Washington: a Democratic president who owes a huge debt to Latinos, and a Republican Party desperate to find a way to avoid another landslide loss among one of the fastest-growing sections- of the electorate.\par \par \uc2 "Democrats want reform, and Republicans need it. That's the new dynamic," said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America's Voice, an immigrant advocacy group.\par \par \uc2 Even before the election, -Republican strategists were increasingly worried that the GOP's hard-line opposition to immigration reform was endangering its long-term viability by making the party toxic to Latinos.\par \par \uc2 Since those fears were borne out Tuesday, several Republican leaders, including House Speaker \uc2 John Boehner\uc2 , have said the GOP needs to reckon with immigration reform and pass a comprehensive bill.\par \par \uc2 "This issue has been around far too long," Boehner said in an interview with ABC News on Thursday. "I'm confident that the president, myself, others, can find the common ground to take care of this issue once and for all."\par \par \uc2 But immigration has divided the GOP for years, and some Republican lawmakers are already pushing back, setting up a potential internecine battle if immigration reform comes up next year, as expected.\par \par \uc2 Most comprehensive proposals that have circulated in the past would have increased border security, instituted verification requirements for employers to ensure they are not hiring illegal workers, changed the visa system to bring in more high-skilled workers, and provided a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants here now.\par \par \uc2 Under most comprehensive plans, those immigrants would have to pass a background check and prove they can speak or are studying English, among other requirements.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  proposed a comprehensive plan in 2004 that would have allowed- illegal immigrants to apply for legal status and stay in the country for up to six years.\par \par \uc2 But after years of negotiations, the plan, backed by Bush and senior lawmakers in both parties, collapsed in 2007. In the Senate, 15 Democrats and 37 Republicans voted against the proposal; many GOP lawmakers complained that opening any pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants would reward lawbreakers and punish immigrants who had played by the rules.\par \par \uc2 Since then, the GOP has adopted an increasingly hard-line tone on immigration, opposing legislation that would provide immigrants who entered or stayed in the United States illegally a way to gain legal status.\par \par \uc2 But on Sunday, as the immigration issue reemerged with new prominence, Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said he had resumed negotiations with Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on an immigration overhaul.\par \par \uc2 Schumer said the two had drawn up a blueprint that he said has ''the real potential for bipartisan support, based on the theory that most Americans are for legal immigration, but very much against illegal immigration."\par \par \uc2 The senators promoted similar overhaul plans in separate interviews on Sunday news shows, and both said no path to citizenship should be available until the country's borders are secure. Graham did not mention working on a plan with Schumer, chairman of the immigration subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\par \par \uc2 Already, the GOP's new openness on immigration reform is opening up fissures in the party.\par \par \uc2 After Boehner's interview last week, Representative John Fleming, a Louisiana Republican, told the Associated Press that Boehner was ''getting ahead of House Republicans when he commits to getting a 'comprehensive approach' to immigration."\par \par \uc2 ''There's been zero discussion of this issue within the conference, and I'm urging the speaker to talk with House Republicans before making pledges on the national news," he said.\par \par \uc2 Yet others saw Tuesday as a wake-up call that could not be ignored. According to exit polls, 71 percent of Latinos voted for Obama, up from the 67 percent he received in 2008. More importantly, the number of Latinos in the electorate has grown sharply, especially in battleground states like Florida, Colorado, and Nevada, where 18 percent of the electorate was Latino, up from 15 percent in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Those voters are, by definition, not illegal immigrants. But according to one poll, 60 percent of Latino voters in New Mexico, 66 percent in Arizona, and 69 percent in Colorado had a friend, relative, or co-worker who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . In another poll, 60 percent of Latino voters said \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's hard-line stance on immigration made them less enthusiastic about him.\par \par \uc2 During the Republican primaries, Romney said he favored "self- deportation" of illegal immigrants, and opposed the Dream Act, a narrow immigration bill that would have created a pathway to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants, but not adults who came here illegally.\par \par \uc2 After the congressional GOP blocked that bill, Obama instituted some of its provisions with an executive order that was decried by Republicans but was popular among many -Latino voters.\par \par \uc2 Still, Obama came under fire during the campaign for not keeping his 2008 promise to pursue broader immigration reform. Now that Latino votes helped keep him in the White House, expectations are high that he will deliver this time.\par \par \uc2 Politically, Republicans may have backed themselves into a no- win situation. They could dig in and continue to obstruct immigration reform, and risk further alienating Latinos. Or they could embrace reform, which would give Obama a huge victory, allowing him to deliver on his promise and perhaps bolster the Democrats' standing among Latinos still further. Many Republicans also fear that many of the new citizens created by a reform law would vote Democratic.\par \par \uc2 The political dividends of the immigration issue have not been lost on Democrats. In a pre-election interview with the Des Moines Register, which was initially off the record but later released, Obama credited the GOP's opposition to immigration reform as a factor giving him an edge in the election.\par \par \uc2 "And since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt," he said. "Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community."\par \par \uc2 Alan Wirzbicki can be reached at awirzbicki@globe.com.\par \par \uc2 Caption: During a rally Thursday of immigration rights organizations in front of the White House, activists called on a newly reelected President Obama to fulfill his promise of passing comprehensive immigration reform.

Predictable. Exciting. Disappointing. Terrifying. The future is all these things and so much more. Three authors present new YA novels where the teen protagonists must make daunting decisions in order to move forward.\par \par \uc2 If David Levithan's ambitious and provocative new novel were a movie it'd be the kind that leaves viewers shuffling out of the theater asking, "Uh, what just happened?" Among his many themes, he addresses sexuality, gender, and death and makes an argument that not only is there an essential self beyond the physical body, but when it comes to romance the outer casing doesn't matter. "This is what love does: It makes you want to rewrite the world."\par \par \uc2 In "Every Day," a genderless 16-year-old being known only as A wakes up each morning in a different person, but it's not until A meets and falls in love with Rhiannon, a suburban Maryland girl, that the teen begins to wish for permanence. Over the course of the story, A experiences life as a suicidal introvert, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , an obese guy, a gorgeous Beyonce look-alike, twins, and even Rhiannon. However, when one of the bodies A inhabited makes headlines, claiming he was possessed, A is provoked both to offer and find answers about him/herself.\par \par \uc2 The ending is abrupt and leaves you wishing for more explanations. (What exactly would A have to do to stay in one body forever?) But maybe it only feels that way because we're not ready to let A go. Through A's eyes readers get to experience what it would be like to be someone different but the same. As A explains to Rhiannon, "...when who you are changes every day you get to touch the universal more."\par \par \uc2 Joyce Carol Oates's "Two or Three Things I Forgot to Tell You," follows the lingering effect a girl's suicide has on the friends she left behind. A former child actress, volatile Katrina "Tink" Traumer was originally dismissed by most of the students at Quaker Heights Day School in New Jersey as bratty and rude. But one group welcomes her and she soon becomes the sun around which they all orbit--so much so that the girls refer to themselves as "Tink, Inc." After she kills herself, the loneliness and depression that floated through these teens' privileged world like a low-lying fog becomes a series of dark clouds that hang particularly low over Merissa Carmichae, "The Perfect One," and Nadia Stillinger, a lost bullying victim.\par \par \uc2 Though the parents are largely so self-absorbed and evil they could be \uc2 Disney\uc2  villains, Oates creates impressively nuanced teen female characters while writing from a number of perspectives. Tink in particular is a fascinating combination of charisma and aloofness, intelligence and insolence, strength and vulnerability. She demands emotional investment--and indeed such investment is necessary for readers to make it through the more troubling passages. Otherwise it would be too easy to turn away from Merissa's destructive secret, Nadia's deep-rooted insecurities, and the demanding issues that Oates's affecting (and ultimately hopeful) novel explores.\par \par \uc2 And finally, "Amelia Anne is Dead and Gone" by Kat Rosenfeld is an evocative debut told from the point of views of Becca, a salutatorian who cannot wait to break free from her New England small town, and Amelia Anne Richardson, a recent college grad who cannot wait for her new life to begin. Becca's final summer before college is derailed when the body of a murdered girl turns up on the side of the road. Her high school dropout boyfriend starts acting strangely. Her parents' marriage seems rocky. And she begins to doubt her decision to leave behind her first love and the village that has been her world. Her emotional and spiritual turmoil is juxtaposed to Amelia's joy and conflict as she travels with her boyfriend and debates about telling him her separate dreams for the next year.\par \par \uc2 Rosenfeld so perfectly captures both small-town ennui and that terrifying gulf between the end of one thing and the beginning of another that certain passages left me with a tightening in my chest. "My dark moods, my nervousness, my paralysis in the face of the future -- they were all understandable," thinks Becca. "If I seemed to be fading, they thought, it was only natural. I was on my way out, moving on, already gone."\par \par \uc2 The ending comes like a quick intake of breath: sharp and sudden. The people of Bridgeton discover who's behind the death and Becca discovers that her future is inextricably bound in the town she will never fully escape, a summer when her life was forever changed, and a murdered girl named Amelia Anne, whose own future, "with all of its untraveled roads and unexplored possibilities," was taken from her.\par \par \uc2 Every Day\par \par \uc2 David Levithan\par \par \uc2 Knopf Books for Young Readers\par \par \uc2 336 pp., $16.99\par \par \uc2 Two or Three Things I Forgot to Tell You\par \par \uc2 Joyce Carol Oates\par \par \uc2 HarperTeen\par \par \uc2 288 pp., $17.99\par \par \uc2 Amelia Anne is Dead and Gone\par \par \uc2 By Kat Rosenfeld\par \par \uc2 Dutton Juvenile\par \par \uc2 304 pp., $17.99\par \par \uc2 Chelsey Philpot, a book review editor at School Library Journal, can be reached at philpotchelsey@gmail.com.\par \par \uc2 Caption: istockphoto   \par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020120916e89g0004i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Young people and their parents craned their necks to make sense of a PowerPoint presentation that outlined the requirements of the program, as toddlers wailed and speakers shouted to be heard above the din.\par \par \uc2 Applicants must have entered the country before they turned 16 and must have earned a high school diploma or its equivalent or be currently enrolled in high school, to qualify. That part was clear, but people had other questions.\par \par \uc2 Does a Spanish-language high school equivalency program meet the requirement of a high-school -diploma, or does the program have to be English-language? If an applicant was using a false Social - Security number, should it be included on the form? If a young person was charged with a misdemeanor but the case was dropped, will it count against him?\par \par \uc2 Natalia De Silva, 20, came to the Chelsea meeting with a solid foundation on the requirements of the federal program. When President Obama -announced it two months ago, she started scouring the websites of the Department of Homeland Security and \uc2 US Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2  for information.\par \par \uc2 Still, she had questions Wednesday about which -records she needs to provide -- report cards? exam scores? -- to properly document her time as a student in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "You kind of have to be an expert, to know every single thing in case something goes wrong,'' De Silva said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , a nonprofit think tank research- ing worldwide migration patterns, estimates that 10,000 to 20,000 people in Massa-chusetts are eligible for deferred action, which can be renewed every two years.\par \par \uc2 But the swiftness with which this program has been rolled out has raised a need for more information sessions and clinics to inform eligible people on how to submit an application.\par \par \uc2 Earlier Wednesday, about 20 members of the Student Immigrant Movement gathered on Friend Street in Boston to share tips and pointers on filling out the application.\par \par \uc2 Isabel Vargas, who came to the United States from the -Dominican Republic when she was 8 years old, told others at the meeting, held in the offices of Greater Boston Legal Services, that the opportunity to apply would transform her future.\par \par \uc2 "When I apply for a job, I don't have to be all nervous about what Social Security number I'm going to give,'' -Vargas, 20, said.\par \par \uc2 Some speakers also took time to warn of potential pitfalls in the application process. They advised people to be wary of individuals feigning legal -expertise, known as notarios, who charge large sums with promises of immediate results.\par \par \uc2 Instead, they suggested that applicants have their forms and documents reviewed at free clinics provided by the Student Immigrant Movement and Greater Boston Legal Services. Those clinics are set to start Sept. 1, and will take place in East Boston, Lynn, Lawrence, and New Bedford.\par \par \uc2 "Don't rush it,'' said Conrado Santos, a member of the Student Immigrant Movement. "It's better to send something good and complete. You don't need to rush.''\par \par \uc2 Daniela Bravo, 25, said she had already downloaded a -deferred action form off the \uc2 US Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2  website and printed it out, but she does not plan to submit her application until it has been reviewed at a Student Immigrant Movement clinic and she is certain it has no mistakes or omissions.\par \par \uc2 "You don't want to mess it up,'' Bravo said. "You don't want to ruin your chance.''\par \par \uc2 While they were apprehensive about filling out the applications, the attendees were united in their elation that they have a chance to live and work here without worrying about deportation.\par \par \uc2 "It's a chance for young aspir-ing immigrants to come out of the shadows, to openly live out your dreams,'' said the Rev. Cheng Imm Tan, director of the city's Office of New -Bostonians.\par \par \uc2 Still, some expressed dis-appointment that only people younger than 31 are eligible.\par \par \uc2 "I feel sad, because there are a lot more people: my mom, my dad, my uncles and cousins,'' said Aly Lopez, 20, of Somerville. "It's good that now we've got a chance . . . but there are a lot more people who deserve this opportunity.''\par \par \uc2 Martine Powers can be reached at mpowers@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Galapagos Islands\par \par \uc2 There is a single word that defines these islands: remote. Isolated from their ancestors, the animals and plants here adapted so that they could live and thrive in this unforgiving environment. The interaction of ocean currents, coastal conditions, and the islands' volcanic origins continues to create a home for some of the strangest of biological life forms. Adaptation breeds greater variety and greater specialization. Now almost half of the species here occur nowhere else on the planet.\par \par \uc2 Blindingly colorful arrays of flora and fauna grow on ash so soft that land iguanas bask on it for hours under the equatorial sun. Penguins and giant tortoises share a sea so plentiful in aquatic life that the waters seem overcrowded. For centuries, that least isolationist of species, humans, left the Galapagos alone. While wildlife thrives here, humans have not. This is not a place for many people to live.\par \par \uc2 Until now. People keep coming, and they keep staying, challenging this solitary spirit -- and prompting Ecuador, of which the Galapagos Islands are a province, to restrict new migrants and even force out current island residents who came from somewhere else. In an effort to help save the islands 600 miles into the Pacific Ocean, Ecuador's controversial president, Rafael Correa, has adopted one of the strictest migration enforcement efforts in the history of mankind. It is as though the United States took the same unforgiving rules it uses to limit the influx of foreigners and used them to keep Americans from going to the state of Hawaii.\par \par \uc2 Few governments today keep their own people from living in a part of their own country; the ones that forcibly evict their own people tend to do so in the name of politics or religion. Ecuador's harsh approach, in contrast, goes back to the challenging landscape that Charles Darwin famously noted.\par \par \uc2 No indigenous human population has ever survived here due to the lack of fresh water and valuable soil; the only people here are immigrants who have managed a relatively sparse existence. But today, high levels of migration in response to increased tourism have made the islands a very lucrative place to be. Ecuadorians can get higher-paying jobs in an industry that barely existed a decade ago than they can on the mainland.\par \par \uc2 And that's the problem. Ecuador needs to continue to attract tourists who represent a large proportion of Ecuador's economy. But it can't afford to have too many of its citizens take advantage of the potential cash gains without risking what makes the islands so attractive in the first place: their isolation.\par \par \uc2 The population of the Galapagos has nearly doubled in the past decade, to about 35,000 residents. Infrastructure and development demands are placing stresses on places like Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island, where only a few people once braved the elements. New viruses and bacteria brought by the outside world threaten the careful balance that breeds life here.\par \par \uc2 Because of issues like these, Ecuador now treats any Ecuadorian not born on the Galapagos, or married to someone from the islands, as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who can be found and deported. Since this policy began, thousands of Ecuadorians have been told to move off the islands.\par \par \uc2 In small towns on these islands, the hints of a rigid enforcement policy are everywhere. For the past few years, residents must have work permits or residency proof. Many who cannot prove their origins are asked to leave. National police from the mainland are a constant presence. Checkpoints line Charles Darwin Street on Santa Cruz.\par \par \uc2 Darwin's theories, inspired by his voyage on the Beagle in the 1830s, are really all about competition for limited space and resources. And while recent in-depth studies here have challenged some aspects of Darwin's descriptions, including the pace of evolution, nothing has touched its basic core: only the fittest survive.\par \par \uc2 Though it reflects a political decision, not a form of natural selection, Ecuador's migration policy offers an odd echo of Darwin's principle: Those who were born to this environment can stay here; others will be weeded out.\par \par \uc2 Juliette Kayyem can be reached at jkayyem@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 House and Senate lawmakers delivered a state budget to Governor Deval Patrick on Thursday that loosens a ban on gifts from drug companies to doctors, tightens rules for welfare recipients, and includes provisions to crack down on illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The bill reflects the melding of earlier versions of the budget passed by the House and Senate and will be subject to possible vetoes by Patrick. The governor's budget chief, Jay Gonzalez, released a statement praising lawmakers for approving changes Patrick had sought in the oversight of community colleges, but saying the rest remains under review.\par \par \uc2 The $32.5 billion blueprint for the budget year that begins Sunday includes no new taxes or fees, and reverses some of the cuts most feared by social services advocates. It keeps Taunton State Hospital open with 45 beds, rejecting Patrick's plan to close the mental health facility and move its patients to a new hospital in Worcester.\par \par \uc2 It also provides the first raise in five years for 31,500 direct care workers who assist people with disabilities and who earn less than $40,000 a year. They will get a 1.5 percent to 2 percent raise, a modest bump for workers with starting salaries of about $12 an hour.\par \par \uc2 "It's a historic moment that they have been recognized by the Legislature as deserving of this support,'' said Michael Weekes, chief executive of the Providers' Council, an association of health and human service agencies that lobbied hard for the $20 million needed to fund the raises.\par \par \uc2 The budget restores some dental benefits to 800,000 Medicaid recipients in Massachusetts who lost dental coverage, except for cleanings and extractions, in a budget cut three years ago. The new plan extends insurance coverage for fillings in the front teeth, but not the back teeth, and not for dentures or crowns.\par \par \uc2 Brian Rosman, research director of the advocacy group Health Care for All, said lawmakers decided to extend coverage to only front teeth because they believed those teeth are most important when Medicaid recipients are applying for jobs. "It's a halfway measure, and we strongly think all dental benefits should be restored,'' Rosman said.\par \par \uc2 Following the recent high-profile arrests of welfare recipients accused of fraud, lawmakers banned recipients from using Electronic Benefit Transfer cards to buy alcohol, lottery tickets, tobacco, pornography, jewelry, and tattoos, among other items.\par \par \uc2 They also prohibited liquor stores, casinos, strip clubs, gun shops, manicurists, cruise ships and rent-to-own stores from accepting the cards.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the EBT program had sought to ban welfare recipients from using the cards to withdraw cash. But lawmakers opted instead to set up a commission to study a cashless payment system.\par \par \uc2 Representative Shaunna O'Connell, a Taunton Republican and leading EBT critic, said she was pleased with the changes, but added: "If we don't deal with the fact that people can access all this cash, the rest of the reforms will be virtually meaningless.''\par \par \uc2 Deborah Harris\uc2 , an attorney at the \uc2 Massachusetts Law Reform Institute\uc2 , which advocates for welfare recipients, said the changes were not about reducing fraud. "This is about micromanaging what eligible families can do with the benefits they are poor enough to qualify for,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 In an effort to target illegal immigrants, lawmakers approved stiffer penalties for driving without a license and knowingly employing an unlicensed driver.\par \par \uc2 But they scrapped a Senate proposal that would have required anyone doing business with the state to verify their workers are in the country legally. Critics argued the requirement would burden businesses with red tape.\par \par \uc2 The budget also drops a Senate plan that would have required all residents in public housing to prove they are in the country legally. Critics contended the rule would break up families who include legal and illegal residents.\par \par \uc2 "We're very pleased,'' that the bill protects "the interests of all the residents of the Commonwealth,'' said Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, which opposed a tough crackdown.\par \par \uc2 Republicans said they, too, were pleased that the budget targets \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  drivers. "Unlicened drivers continue to pose a serious public safety threat to all law-abiding citizens,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bruce E. Tarr.\par \par \uc2 The budget weakens a 2008 state law that forbids drug companies from giving gifts to doctors. It allows drug companies to pay for "modest'' restaurant meals for doctors, as long as those meals are part of an informational briefing. State regulators will have to define "modest.'' Drug companies will also have to report their spending to the state.\par \par \uc2 The hotel and restaurant lobbies fought hard for the change, arguing the ban was hurting business. House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo said some restaurants reported losing 20 percent of their sales after the ban passed three years ago.\par \par \uc2 Rosman, of Health Care for All, criticized the change. He said restaurant meals funded by drug companies encourage doctors to prescribe more costly brand-name medications. Medical decisions should be based on "objective information, not fancy meals,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers left intact a ban on drug companies paying for doctors' junkets on cruise ships and tickets to sporting events.\par \par \uc2 Addressing concerns about poor coordination among community colleges, lawmakers approved changes that Patrick sought to strengthen his role in running the schools. The changes allow the governor to appoint the board chairs of community colleges, and require the state to develop rules for the selection, evaluation, and removal of community college presidents.\par \par \uc2 Responding to outrage over the $50 million annual pay for Liberty Mutual's chief executive, the budget also requires mutual insurance companies to disclose the pay for top executives and board members. But lawmakers struck a measure that would have given policyholders a vote on pay and required directors to be independent.\par \par \uc2 Michael Levenson can be reached at mlevenson@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A man with a Mexican flag and a woman with an American one debated Arizona's immigration law at the State Capitol.\par \par \uc2 patrick breen/arizona republic via associated press\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON - The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  on Monday struck down significant portions of the controversial Arizona immigration law, but allowed to stand a hot-button provision that requires police officers to review the immigration status of any detainees they suspect of being in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 The high court, reviewing four portions of the law, struck down three, saying that the state had overstepped its authority by making it a state crime for immigrants not to register with the federal government, or for illegal immigrants to seek work or hold a job. It also threw out a provision that would allow police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without a warrant.\par \par \uc2 Although the justices were divided 5 to 3 on the three provisions, on the most controversial ruling they were united: They unanimously upheld the centerpiece of the legislation, the "show me your papers'' provision, which requires police officers to check the immigration status of anyone stopped or arrested who they suspect is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Critics, including President Obama, say the provision will encourage racial profiling, because officers will check the status only of those who look as if they are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The justices suggested the provision could be subject to more challenges, depending on how it is implemented.\par \par \uc2 Overall, the case tested a state's powers to enforce federal immigration laws. Essentially, the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruled it was up to Congress - not individual states -- to solve some of the persistent immigration problems the country faces.\par \par \uc2 "The national government has significant power to regulate immigration,'' Justice \uc2 Anthony Kennedy\uc2  wrote for the five-member majority on the three provisions that were struck down.\par \par \uc2 "With power comes responsibility, and the sound exercise of national power over immigration depends on the nation's meeting its responsibility to base its laws on a political will informed by searching, thoughtful, rational civic discourse.''\par \par \uc2 "Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues, but the state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 The others voting in the majority were Chief Justice \uc2 John Roberts\uc2  and justices \uc2 Stephen G. Breyer\uc2 , Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor.\par \par \uc2 Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., \uc2 Antonin Scalia\uc2 , and Clarence Thomascast dissenting votes, while Justice Elena Kagan, who was solicitor general when the Obama administration sued Arizona, recused herself.\par \par \uc2 Scalia was particularly pointed in his dissent, at one point taking Obama to task for a shift in policy earlier this month to halt deportations for certain young immigrants who came to the United States illegally with their parents.\par \par \uc2 "The president said at a news conference that the new program is 'the right thing to do' in light of Congress's failure to pass the administration's proposed revision of the immigration act,'' Scalia wrote. "Perhaps it is, though Arizona may not think so. But to say, as the court does, that Arizona contradicts federal law by enforcing applications of federal immigration act that the president declines to enforce boggles the mind.''\par \par \uc2 The decision further injects the volatile topic of immigration into the presidential race, with both candidates trying to appeal to the Hispanic voters who are making up a larger slice of the electorate, particularly in swing states such as Florida, Colorado, and Nevada, as well as Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Obama said he was pleased with most of the decision but concerned about the "show me your papers'' ruling, agreeing with many immigration advocates that it would encourage racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 "No American should ever live under a cloud of suspicion just because of what they look like,'' Obama said in a statement. "Going forward, we must ensure that Arizona law enforcement officials do not enforce this law in a manner that undermines the civil rights of Americans, as the Court's decision recognizes.''\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney, who took a hard-line stance on immigration during the Republican primary but has since softened his approach, lightly criticized the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  decision. During the Republican primary, Romney spoke in favor of the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 "Given the failure of the immigration policy in this country, I would have preferred to see the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  give more latitude to states, not less,'' Romney said at a fund-raiser in Scottsdale, Ariz.\par \par \uc2 Romney pledged that in his first year as president he would "make sure we actually do take on immigration.''\par \par \uc2 In Massachusetts, one of many states that erupted in controversy after Arizona passed its law, the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  decision generated praise, concern, and a measure of uncertainty.\par \par \uc2 After Arizona passed the law in 2010, the Boston City Council responded with a resolution divesting funds from the state, a largely symbolic move.\par \par \uc2 Governor Deval Patrick blasted the law and vowed to veto any similar legislation in Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 But the Legislature has continued to debate budget amendments that would limit illegal immigration and last month Massachusetts, after protracted debate, fully deployed Secure Communities, a federal program that automatically checks the fingerprints of everyone arrested by state and local police against immigration databases.\par \par \uc2 Though more passive than having police question illegal immigrants, Secure Communities is allowing federal officials to screen the immigration status of tens of thousands of people arrested nationwide.\par \par \uc2 Observers on both sides of the debate said states are likely to pursue their own immigration laws as long as Congress and the president fail to address the issue.\par \par \uc2 "What's happening is because Congress hasn't created a clear and concise policy on this,'' Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said Monday. "This has gone on and on and on.''\par \par \uc2 The ruling also prompted responses from the candidates for US Senate.\par \par \uc2 Senator Scott Brown, a Massachusetts Republican, said the decision "is another reminder that the federal government needs to deal with our broken immigration system.''\par \par \uc2 "I believe the first step is securing the border and turning off the magnets that encourage people to come into country illegally,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Warren, Brown's Democratic rival, criticized Republicans generally and Brown specifically for not doing more on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Said Warren: "When he talks about 'fixing the broken system,' Scott Brown needs to acknowledge that he's actively blocking reform.''\par \par \uc2 Matt Viser can be reached at maviser@globe.com.

But as the heat turns from powerful to painful in just a few hours, and people run inside for relief, there is little talk of the immigration wars that rage in the political campaigns or a looming Supreme Court decision about Arizona's anti-immigrant law. Immigrants rebuilt this state after Hurricane Katrina; that memory is often why, despite being a pretty conservative place, there is little hatred of the other here. As one Republican politician told me, "We are conservative, yes, but we know Arizona is not where we should be."\par \par \uc2 The immigration story here and, indeed, most everywhere, is different than the one that pits President Obama and the long- sought decision to halt the deportation of young people against Mitt Romney, who opposed it on technical grounds. The American public, not just the Hispanic community, has long passed any equivocation; they immediately supported the decision by a 2-to-1 margin.\par \par \uc2 That support marks a growing consensus on immigration: that comprehensive immigration reform may be desirable, but failure to pass it is not a barrier to progress. The conventional wisdom, and one that even Romney reiterated this week, has been that maximum effort must be placed on this ever-elusive proposal which includes, whether through amnesty or self-deportation or something in between, dealing with the millions of undocumented immigrants all at once. But the pursuit of comprehensive immigration reform is not a precondition to immigration sanity.\par \par \uc2 This focus on one big solution has muted our recognition that we are beginning to form a different narrative about immigration that shuns both the extremes of the right, too cruel and unforgiving, and of the left, too kind and forgiving.\par \par \uc2 Traveling this country, outside the areas where conventional wisdom is formed, makes the contours of this other narrative clear. Arizona, the outlier, is left to suffer from its self-destructive behavior; relatively few states seem inclined to follow suit, given the economic and political toll such radical conservatism has taken on the state. Alabama, which quickly followed Arizona down the path, is already redressing some of the excesses. Mississippi defeated similar provisions.\par \par \uc2 At the border, greater enforcement and economic realities have reduced the quantity of illegal crossings. Even by conservative estimates, there is no net increase in the number of undocumented immigrants; just as many are leaving as sneaking in.\par \par \uc2 In cities like New York and Boston, the growing consensus is that our political failure on illegal immigration has blinded us to the need for changes to our legal migration rules. Bipartisan support for removing the cap on H-1B visas for immigrants with special skills coveted by the private sector should not be left dangling as we figure out our illegal immigration problem.\par \par \uc2 For too long, liberals and immigrant-rights activists have used a strategy of all or nothing to advance their cause. It is why legislative advancement on the DREAM Act was delayed and then doomed; they feared that if the administration focused too much on the easy cases, the high-school valedictorians who did not even know they weren't native born, then the harder ones - including illegal immigrants with no DREAM-like stories - would be forgotten.\par \par \uc2 It may have taken the pressure of a looming election to get Obama to change the rules for young people who came to the United States as children. Whatever the political implications of the Hispanic vote are for the parties, the nation does not live only in election cycles.\par \par \uc2 And even if, as many commentators suggest, the Supreme Court rules in favor of Arizona's law next week, that victory could backfire on the very conservatives who pushed the law. Arizona's demand that police check the papers of anyone they think might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is better viewed as a cautionary tale on what happens when politicians stray too far from a consensus narrative.\par \par \uc2 Settling for a piecemeal approach is just that: settling. But it is not failure. Little by little, neither too cruel nor too kind, the momentum for change is increasing.\par \par \uc2 As it should. Nothing remains static. This week, a Pew Research Center study confirmed that Asians are now the fastest-growing immigrant population and are contributing in unique ways to our skilled economy.\par \par \uc2 That's evident in every high-tech business in Silicon Valley - but also, surprisingly, in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where Vietnamese-born fishermen share small vessels with their Cajun partners.\par \par \uc2 Juliette Kayyem can be reached at jkayyem@globe.com and Twitter @juliettekayyem.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020120621e86l0000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The federal program now sharing the fingerprints of everyone arrested in Massachusetts with immigration authorities has immigrant communities worried statewide, according to police and activists who say they are working overtime to dispel rumors of roundups, roadblocks, and mass deportations.\par \par \uc2 No sooner had the controversial information-sharing program taken effect in Massachusetts on May 15 than frantic telephone calls began pouring in to Framingham's Brazilian radio station, WSRO-AM (650).\par \par \uc2 Callers reported hearing of a crackdown in Hudson, and a blitz of police checking green cards in Framingham and Marlborough. A crash on Route 9 spawned talk of a roadblock to check IDs.\par \par \uc2 None of it was true.\par \par \uc2 "There is a lot of fear in our community. There is confusion. There is misinformation," said community activist Ilton Lisboa, who hosts a call-in show Wednesday nights with a Framingham police officer, Lieutenant Patricia Grigas. "I'm glad that this law is in place. They are targeting criminals, not ordinary people. We need to clarify that."\par \par \uc2 Lisboa, who recently had Marlborough Police Chief Mark Leonard on the show to discuss the federal Secure Communities program, said many callers ask the same question - will they be fingerprinted just for reporting a crime?\par \par \uc2 The answer, Grigas and Leonard both said, is no.\par \par \uc2 "I think there is so much knee-jerk reaction to just the name Secure Communities. And it is misinformation. People are just reacting out of panic and fear of what they don't know about the program," Grigas said.\par \par \uc2 "For the local law enforcement, nothing changes from what we have been doing the last five years, the last 10 years. The fear in the community - and I am not even sure where they are hearing it - but they are hearing the program means the police will stop you on the street and demand ID and green cards. That is not true at all."\par \par \uc2 "We had heard people are afraid to go to the hospital, afraid to go to the police station," Leonard said. "When crimes are not reported, that doesn't help anybody. We want them to know this only affects people who commit crimes."\par \par \uc2 Under Secure Communities, police forward the fingerprints of all arrests electronically to the State Police, and the agency then shares the prints with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. The point is to identify violent criminals and repeat immigration-law offenders, said Ross Feinstein, spokesman for \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Secure Communities has helped ICE remove more than 135,000 convicted criminal aliens, including more than 49,000 convicted of major violent offenses like murder, rape and the sexual abuse of children," Feinstein said, while generating a total of 179,000 deportations since 2008.\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities came to Massachusetts as a pilot program with the Boston Police Department in 2006, but statewide adoption met with resistance from civil rights activists and elected officials, including Governor Deval Patrick and Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who feared the system could lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 Participation in Secure Communities is now mandated by the federal government.\par \par \uc2 It officially became nationwide last week, when Maine became the final state to accept the program, Feinstein said.\par \par \uc2 But fear about Secure Communities remains, according to Eva A. Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, which has been hearing from member organizations statewide.\par \par \uc2 "As far as implementation, we have been inundated with calls. They are coming in from across the state, from Springfield and Western Mass., from Marlborough, from Framingham, from Everett, from Somerville, from East Boston," Millona said.\par \par \uc2 "We have domestic violence centers telling us they have victims who are too afraid to go forward" with their cases over concern that their immigration status will be checked, she said.\par \par \uc2 "Parenting Information Centers already are telling us people are too afraid to register their children for school. We have health centers telling us people are canceling their appointments. The impact is statewide, and fears about this program are interfering profoundly with people's lives."\par \par \uc2 "We have been against Secure Communities from the beginning. This is the type of thing we worried would happen - despite its name, that it would make communities less secure," said Christopher Ott, communications director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 "There is this fear that people would be caught up in dragnets."\par \par \uc2 The fear of being profiled may also discourage legal residents and US citizens from reporting crimes and cooperating with police, Ott said.\par \par \uc2 In Milford, Police Chief Thomas O'Loughlin said talk of profiling under Secure Communities is unfounded, since the program eliminates police discretion on whose fingerprints are forwarded to immigration authorities. All prints go to ICE, he said.\par \par \uc2 O'Loughlin has been reaching out to the town's Ecuadoran and Brazilian communities through area churches, and even spoke recently with Beatriz Stein, Ecuador's consul general, who had visited Milford after a fatal crash involving an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  last year.\par \par \uc2 The case highlighted a chronic problem of undocumented immigrants driving without valid licenses, with Milford police averaging one arrest per day on the charge, O'Loughlinsaid.\par \par \uc2 "I had a conversation with the consul general. She asked me how things went the first week" of Secure Communities, O'Loughlin said. "I told her we had only one case flagged by ICE," the May 17 arrest of Tigoberto Orellano-Alonso, 25, of Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Orellano-Alonso, charged with operating under the influence of alcohol and driving without a license, initially gave police a false name, O'Loughlin said.\par \par \uc2 The check of his fingerprints revealed he had been previously deported in 2002, O'Loughlin said.\par \par \uc2 Orellano-Alonso is being held on an immigration detainer, and faces deportation proceedings after resolution of the case in Milford.\par \par \uc2 Jose Martinez can be reached at martinezjose1@me.com.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020120603e8630004d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK - The man with piercing green eyes began to shake as he stared past the checkpoint, down a crowded corridor into an unfamiliar airport terminal.\par \par \uc2 It would be the first time Oscar Alfredo Ramirez Castaneda, now 32 and living in Framingham, would meet his biological father since a squad of government soldiers slaughtered his mother and eight brothers and sisters 30 years ago in their small village during the height of the civil war in Guatemala.\par \par \uc2 Until last year, when he received a call from prosecutors in Guatemala and agreed to submit to a DNA test, Ramirez had no idea that as a young child he had been abducted by an army lieutenant who led that assault, and raised as a member of his family. Or that his real father was still alive.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, as his own young children giggled with excitement and held signs to welcome their new grandfather to Newark Liberty International Airport, Ramirez was not sure what to feel. "I'm nervous," he said. "Anxious."\par \par \uc2 Ramirez said he grew up in a loving family and lacks any grudge against Lieutenant Oscar Ovidio Ramirez Ramos, the deputy commander of the notorious squad of commandos that killed more than 250 men, women, and children and wiped Dos Erres, his village in northern Guatemala, off the map.\par \par \uc2 "It's very hard for me," Ramirez would say later. "I can't change what happened in my life. I just can't. He was good to me. First of all, I didn't get killed, and then he didn't treat me bad."\par \par \uc2 The lieutenant died in a truck accident eight months after kidnapping Ramirez, who was 3 at the time. "Everyone I knew loved him and thought he was a good man," said Ramirez. "They saw him as a hero."\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the day, with the help of a New York lawyer and a foundation supporting his bid for political asylum in the United States, Ramirez and his family took a train from South Station into Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 Now, with his wife, Nidia, by his side, and the children growing antsy, Ramirez began to sweat in the air-conditioned corridor at the airport. The children, dressed as if they were going to church, only knew they were going to meet their grandfather from Guatemala.\par \par \uc2 Over the past year, Ramirez and his father, Tranquilino Castaneda, now 70, have spoken nearly every day over the phone, even chatting twice by video. Ramirez has sent him money and urged him to go easy on the rum, which has been Castaneda's companion and tormentor since he returned from the fields that day in 1982 to find his pregnant wife and other children dead.\par \par \uc2 Castaneda had always assumed that his youngest son, a chubby toddler with missing front teeth whom he called Alfredito, had been thrown down the village well and left to die with the others. He never remarried, struggled with alcoholism, and lived in a shack in the jungle after giving up on farming when the arthritis in his leg became too much.\par \par \uc2 Now he was getting on a plane for the first time, leaving his country for the first time.\par \par \uc2 "I'm just glad to have lived long enough to see this day," Castaneda would say later.\par \par \uc2 As anxious as he felt, Ramirez said he knew he had to meet his father in person, to touch him, to hug him.\par \par \uc2 "I just wanted to have him with me," Ramirez said. "He doesn't have to be alone anymore."\par \par \uc2 A lawyer waiting with the family received a call from one of the human rights advocates traveling with Castaneda. They had landed.\par \par \uc2 A trickle of passengers grew into a surge passing through the security barrier. Then Ramirez's girls began to jump and scream.\par \par \uc2 They instantly recognized the man in the weathered white cowboy hat that shaded his sun-creased face after years of harvesting corn. He was being pushed on a wheelchair.\par \par \uc2 The children - Andrea, 11, Nicole, 7, and Oscar, 5 - wrapped their arms around their grandfather, who was beaming. Then Ramirez, still holding 10-month-old Dulce, leaned in for a long, deep hug that lasted nearly 30 seconds.\par \par \uc2 Father and son both wiped the tears filling their nearly identical green eyes.\par \par \uc2 There would be a lot to catch up on, such as how justice is slowly coming to pass in Guatemala, where members of the military and government officials guilty of ordering mass murder have evaded prosecution for years.\par \par \uc2 A Guatemalan court last August found three former commandos who participated in the attack on Dos Erres guilty of murder and human rights violations. The defendants each received sentences of 6,060 years in prison, or 30 years for every one of the 201 identified victims, plus 30 more for crimes against humanity.\par \par \uc2 Seven suspects remain at large, including two of the squad's top officers. Authorities told ProPublica, a nonprofit online news site that first reported the story of how prosecutors identified Ramirez, that they believe the suspects could be in the United States or in Guatemala, sheltered by powerful networks linking the military and organized crime.\par \par \uc2 They would also be able to talk about Ramirez's adopted family, who were shocked to learn of Ramirez's true identity. After learning the news, Ramirez's cousins promptly invited Castaneda to the town where Ramirez grew up, and treated him graciously, like family.\par \par \uc2 At the airport, Ramirez led his father to baggage claim and then to a van waiting to take the family into New York City for a dinner arranged by R. Scott Greathead, a partner in the New York office of Wiggin and Dana, who helped arrange the visit. Greathead and lawyers from Mintz Levin in Boston will represent Ramirez, who entered the United States as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , at a hearing in which Ramirez will seek political asylum. He will argue that he is at risk because he is living proof of a massacre in Guatemala and could be targeted by those hoping to avoid prosecution.\par \par \uc2 After dinner, Ramirez and his family took a train back to Boston. His father remained in New York to get some rest.\par \par \uc2 The next morning, Castaneda was driven to Framingham, where he will sleep in Ramirez's bed. He has a visa to stay in the United States for six months.\par \par \uc2 As they chatted over a lunch of pupusas on Tuesday afternoon in the family's cramped two-bedroom apartment, which is full of children's toys and family photos, including portraits of the lieutenant's mother, they talked about the price of cigarettes in the States, how to buy pants, and what life was like in Dos Erres before soldiers burned it to the ground.\par \par \uc2 Castaneda showed Ramirez pictures of those who died, including one of his sisters, a 13-year-old named Maribel.\par \par \uc2 As they talked, Ramirez's children clung to their father and grandfather, who pinched their cheeks, gave them long hugs, and cooed with affection. He couldn't get enough of them.\par \par \uc2 "I'm very happy to be here," Castaneda said.\par \par \uc2 David Abel can be reached at dabel@globe.com.

Castaneda and Ramirez, with daughters Nicole and Andrea, looked at pictures from Guatemala. Tranquilino Castaneda, with granddaughter Andrea Ramirez, had always assumed that his youngest son was dead. "I'm just glad to have lived long enough to see this day," he said.

Not since Reconstruction had the GOP controlled every facet of political life. It wasn't just any ol' Republicans either; former Governor Haley Barbour is considered a moderate now. Governor Phil Bryant is a creature of the Tea Party. Though this is not a border state, every aspect of political life was aligned to follow in the footsteps of Arizona, Alabama, and Georgia in passing sweeping state laws against illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 But something surprising happened in the Magnolia State. While liberals and immigration rights advocates were pinning futile hopes on the Supreme Court invalidating Arizona's anti-immigrant law, lest other conservative states stampede to pass similar bills, Mississippi conservatives quietly shelved their own version. It now appears that Arizona-type laws are more likely to suffer their demise at the hands of politics rather than judges.\par \par \uc2 Mississippi's experience shows how states often learn from the mistakes of their 49 siblings. Draconian anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  laws have been a disaster for Arizona and Alabama. Those states' economies thrived off of undocumented immigrants; not any more. The get-tough laws, allowing officials to check people's immigration status based on mere suspicions, hit many white residents in their wallets. And now, the Arizona and Alabama laws are reportedly being undercut by lack of enforcement, rather than any adverse court rulings.\par \par \uc2 Mississippi's politics still tend to be divided along racial lines. The state is 37 percent African-American, the highest percentage in the nation, and its black community has long been organized around progressive causes. In the 1990s, the state's growing casino industry became a lure for Hispanic immigrants. They joined forces with African-Americans to fight against the rising Republican power. But that seemed to serve only to drive more whites into the Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 And while many of those voters were enraged over illegal immigration, many others, surprisingly, were not. The Mississippi Senate faced strong opposition to its anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  law from the state chamber of commerce, the farm lobby, and, significantly, local governments. Their reasons were all different and were not very appealing. Clearly, the chance to preserve cheap labor with no regulation animated some of the farm and business groups; cities and towns didn't want the extra work of hunting down undocumented workers. And none of these opponents aligned themselves with the liberal forces.\par \par \uc2 The chamber feared that the state's reputation would suffer and engender boycotts. (Mississippi ranks at the bottom of many lists on education, health care, and economic opportunity; adding intolerance seemed one list too many.) Farmers knew they would not have enough workers, and couldn't ignore the accounts coming out of Georgia and Alabama of crops rotting in the fields.\par \par \uc2 These groups changed the way immigration is discussed in a state that's about as conservative as it gets. Rhetoric about civil rights or racial profiling only goes so far here. Business climate, agricultural interests, and fewer government mandates - that's the language that gained traction.\par \par \uc2 With all these "white" interests aligned to defeat the bill, even the most conservative politicians took note. In Mississippi, the lieutenant governor gets to pick the heads of state Senate committees. Tate Reeves, the conservative Republican LG, appointed a Democrat, Bob Armory, as head of the Senate Judiciary Committee and then sent the bill there. Armory never put the bill up to committee vote. It is dead, for now.\par \par \uc2 Reeves, who was criticized by Tea Party members, reminded his party that not all conservatives are on the same page. In defending the procedural move that killed the bill, his spokesperson stated that the concerns "expressed by the \uc2 Mississippi Economic Council\uc2 , Farm Bureau, the Mississippi Poultry Association, and local cities, counties, police chiefs, and sheriffs" weighed heavily.\par \par \uc2 Missing from that list is anything actually related to immigrants or their rights. The opposition spoke the language that would win in a state where conservative Republicans reign. The victory may be discomforting, but it is a victory nonetheless.\par \par \uc2 Juliette Kayyem can be reached at jkayyem@globe.com.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Federal officials next week will expand in Massachusetts a controversial program targeting illegal immigrants, particularly criminals, despite longstanding opposition from Governor Deval Patrick and advocates, according to local law enforcement officials who were notified Tuesday of the launch.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials had announced plans to launch the program- called Secure Communities - by the end of 2013, and the announcement that it would come on May 15 caught some officials by surprise. Patrick has objected to the program on grounds that it nets many immigrants with no criminal convictions.\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities allows federal immigration officials to tap into the longstanding tradition of information-sharing between local law enforcement and the FBI. Local police routinely send the fingerprints of people they arrest to the FBI for criminal background checks. Now, through Secure Communities, the FBI will share those fingerprints with immigration officials to identify illegal immigrants for deportation, especially criminals and repeat violators of federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 The decision by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expand the program in Massachusetts follows intensive lobbying by politicians and local law enforcement. It also follows a string of highly publicized motor vehicle accidents involving illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Last week, a Cape Cod florist died after allegedly being struck by an immigrant who officials said had overstayed her visa. On Friday, a Guatemalan man here illegally was arrested for allegedly driving drunk and trying to run down a State Police trooper.\par \par \uc2 In a pivotal case last August, Matthew Denice of Milford was struck and killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , who was arrested and charged with drunken driving.\par \par \uc2 After Denice's death, many politicians, both Democrats and Republicans, intensified calls on the Patrick administration to embrace Secure Communities.\par \par \uc2 "This isn't just a big victory for law enforcement," said Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, who has lobbied the Patrick administration to embrace the program for months. "This is a big victory for the families who have lost loved ones."\par \par \uc2 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement - known as ICE - had hoped to have Secure Communities in half of Massachusetts counties by October 2010, but negotiations with the Patrick administration stalled.\par \par \uc2 Later that year, the administration said it was willing to enroll in the program. But amid public criticism, the governor changed his mind. Last year, joining the governors of Illinois and New York, Patrick said he favored deporting violent criminals but was concerned that Secure Communities would target immigrants never convicted of a crime.\par \par \uc2 Later federal officials said they would proceed, despite the objections.\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities, which started to expand nationwide in 2008, exists in almost every state, most recently expanding in New Hampshire this week. New York, Arkansas, and Wyoming are expected to fully activate along with Massachusetts next week, officials said.\par \par \uc2 The Boston Police Department, which piloted the program in 2006, is the only department in Massachusetts using the program now.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday, advocates expressed concern that immigrants fearful of deportation will refuse to turn to police for help - or to aid them in their investigations. Advocates have said that victims of domestic violence and other crimes are already afraid to turn to police for fear of deportation, even though police say they will not target crime victims.\par \par \uc2 Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, said her group was disappointed by the news.\par \par \uc2 "We're concerned about how this is going to impact the relationship between immigrant and refugee communities and law enforcement," she said.\par \par \uc2 Some immigrant advocates, including Millona, also say the program is deporting immigrants who have not been convicted of a crime - one of the main goals cited by supporters.\par \par \uc2 US immigration officials declined to comment on the launch.\par \par \uc2 But spokesman Ross Feinstein said immigration enforcement officials have improved the program to focus more intensively on serious criminals and other priorities, which also include immigrants who have reentered the country after having been deported and those with deportation orders.\par \par \uc2 "Over the past three years, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has dramatically changed the way it conducts immigration enforcement," he said in a statement. "Secure Communities has proven to be the single most valuable tool in allowing the agency to eliminate the ad hoc approach of the past and focus on criminal aliens and repeat immigration law violators."\par \par \uc2 But in Boston, only about half the people deported under the program have been convicted of a crime, far lower than the national average of almost 74 percent, according to the most recent statistics available from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "The numbers are alarming," Millona said.\par \par \uc2 The governor's office declined to comment on the launch yesterday, deferring instead to Public Safety Secretary Mary Beth Heffernan, who said in a statement that the governor's office had expected the program to launch eventually and that the state had no control over it.\par \par \uc2 "As previously announced, the Department of Homeland Security notified us today that they plan to launch the federal Secure Communities program in Massachusetts, just as they have already done in other states," Heffernan said. "Secure Communities is an information-sharing program between federal agencies that can only be implemented by the federal government."\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Senator Scott Brown, Worcester County Sheriff Lew Evangelidis, and others said their lobbying had paid off.\par \par \uc2 "The people of Massachusetts will finally have the protection they deserve from violent criminals who have entered our country illegally," Brown said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Evangelidis said he had been advocating for Secure Communities since Denice's death last August. "This program will be a strong tool for law enforcement to identify and deport criminal illegal aliens who commit crimes in our community," he said.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020120509e85900018\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Ballou Globe Staff\par \uc2 709 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2012\par \uc2 The Boston Globe\par \uc2 BSTNGB\par B.1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2012 New York Times Company.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A federal judge, saying he erred in his jury instructions, has ordered a new trial for a former high-ranking official of the US Department of Homeland Security who was convicted of encouraging her housekeeper, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , to stay in this country.\par \par \uc2 "My instructions to the jury as to the elements of the crime were inadequate, and . . . a new trial is warranted, in which appropriate jury instructions fashioned in response to recent developments in the case law will be delivered," US District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock said in a 50-page order released Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 A jury found Lorraine Henderson guilty in March 2010 of encouraging and inducing an illegal alien to remain in the United States, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Woodlock explained that his definition of "encourage" and "induce" to jurors was inadequate, citing a Third Circuit case defining them.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors have waited two years for sentencing, but instead Woodlock has requested an update on the housekeeper's status and reviewed motions by the defense to set aside the jury's verdict or grant a new trial.\par \par \uc2 "We have great concern with the court's decision to disrupt the jury's verdict finding Ms. Henderson guilty," said US Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz.\par \par \uc2 "We are assessing our options, including an appeal."\par \par \uc2 For Henderson, 54, Woodlock's order was a relief.\par \par \uc2 "She's elated at Judge Woodlock's ruling," said Francis DiMento, the Boston lawyer representing Henderson.\par \par \uc2 "She's still working at a pet store," he said. "She lost her whole career because she felt a little empathy for this poor cleaning lady and wanted to find a legal way for her to stay in this country."\par \par \uc2 Henderson worked as Boston port director for Customs and Border Protection, a $140,000-a-year job in which she was responsible for keeping New England's ports secure from illegal immigration. She was headed for a higher post when supervisors learned she was employing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to clean her house.\par \par \uc2 Agency employees were warned not to hire illegal immigrants, and Henderson had been told by a co-worker that her cleaning woman was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 But Henderson continued to employ Fabiana Bitencourt, a Brazilian who lived in Peabody, to clean her four-level townhouse in Salem every couple of weeks from 2004 to 2008.\par \par \uc2 Bitencourt, paid $75 each time she cleaned Henderson's house, was ultimately confronted by Customs and Border Protection agents, tipped off by supervisors, and she agreed to cooperate by wearing a wire. She secretly tape-recorded Henderson advising her not to leave the country.\par \par \uc2 "You can't leave, don't leave . . . once you leave you will never be back," Henderson said, according to court records.\par \par \uc2 The housekeeper is currently in "deferred action" status, according to a letter submitted to Woodlock by Diane C. Freniere, the lead prosecutor in the case.\par \par \uc2 Bitencourt has applied for and been granted deferred action status since 2008, initially to testify in the first trial and now to ensure she will remain in the United States to testify in the retrial. The status defers any deportation proceedings and allows her to stay legally and apply for employment authorization cards, which she has received.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say they have not extended "promises, rewards, or inducements" to Bitencourt in exchange for her testimony. Since the verdict, she has given birth to a child, who is a US citizen.\par \par \uc2 DiMento called it ironic his client tried to find a legal way to help Bitencourt stay in the United States and her good intentions eventually led to temporary legal residency for the housekeeper. "She's indeed been able to stay in the country because of this whole situation," he said.\par \par \uc2 In his order, Woodlock admonished prosecutors for going after Henderson, saying they have been overzealous.\par \par \uc2 "A sense of outrage out of proportion to the circumstances of the misconduct here has apparently driven the case to be pursued as a felony," he stated.\par \par \uc2 Brian R.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island filed the federal lawsuit Tuesday on behalf of Ada Morales, 48, an American citizen. The suit said Morales was illegally detained for one day after US Immigration and Customs Enforcement requested that she be held when she was in custody for an unrelated criminal case in 2009. The suit says Morales, born in Guatemala, became a US citizen in 1995.\par \par \uc2 Document BSTNGB0020120425e84p0000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw256\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3840\pichgoal600

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, downplayed his higher- office aspirations in a TV interview aired Sunday, refusing to discuss his vice presidential prospects and saying he does not think about becoming president some day.\par \par \uc2 But the statements by Rubio, a first-term senator with a burgeoning national profile, were softer than ones he made last week, when he told the National Journal that he would say no if presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney asked him to be his running mate.\par \par \uc2 "Let me just say this about the vice presidential process," Rubio said on CNN's "State of the Union." "Up to now it's all been theoretical. We have a nominee now, and our nominee, Mitt Romney, the leader of the Republican Party, has a vice presidential process in place. . . . I think it would be wise for all Republicans to kind of respect that process, myself included."\par \par \uc2 Rubio continued to deflect speculation elsewhere, saying Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida, would "be a fantastic vice president," after suggesting in the National Journal interview that Romney should consider Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. But Rubio did not repeat his position that he does not want to be vice president.\par \par \uc2 "The last thing [Romney] needs are those of us in the peanut gallery to be saying what we would or would not do," he said Sunday.\par \par \uc2 Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is considered a potential bridge between Romney and Hispanic voters, with whom President Obama enjoys a 40-point lead, according to a Pew Research Center poll released last week.\par \par \uc2 He has proposed a Republican counter to the DREAM Act, which would facilitate citizenship for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youths who enroll in college or enlist in the military. Rubio's plan would let illegal immigrants in college and the military stay in the United States but would not offer them citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Romney, who has spoken strongly against illegal immigration throughout the campaign, has neither endorsed nor rejected Rubio's DREAM Act alternative, saying only that he would study the proposal.\par \par \uc2 Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana said Sunday that he has no interest in becoming the GOP's vice presidential candidate. In an interview on "Fox News Sunday," Daniels said if Romney asked him to join the ticket, he would urge the candidate to reconsider and would send him a list of people he thinks would be better choices.\par \par \uc2 Callum Borchers\par \par \uc2 Gingrich's debt rises as campaign founders\par \par \uc2 Newt Gingrich, whose presidential bid has been dogged by financial problems, racked up nearly $3 million in new debt for private jet flights, security consultants, and travel costs in March as his campaign teetered on the edge of collapse, according to new disclosures.\par \par \uc2 The former House speaker entered April with $4.3 million in total debt, up from $1.5 million the month before, according to reports filed late Friday with the \uc2 Federal Election Commission\uc2 . He raised $1.6 million, spent $2 million, and reported having $1.2 million cash on hand.\par \par \uc2 The Gingrich campaign's top debts for March include $1.1 million to Moby Dick Airways, a private air charter broker; $450,000 to Patriot Group, a Warrenton, Va.-based security firm; and $178,000 to Event Strategies of Alexandria, Va., for "event production." Gingrich is listed as being owed $271,775 for travel costs, and numerous other employees and consultants claim similar travel debts, the records show.\par \par \uc2 The disclosures outline what has become a typical scenario for Gingrich in his topsy-turvy, yearlong campaign for the White House, which nearly imploded last summer amid runaway spending and staff defections. Financial problems also have swallowed the private consulting empire he built after leaving the House in the late 1990s, including a private health care think tank that filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 Gingrich rose in the polls and began to claw his way out of debt during a series of strong performances in Republican candidate debates last fall, but his prospects have plummeted since his surprise win in the South Carolina primary in January. The main thing keeping Gingrich alive for much of the primary season was Winning Our Future, a super PAC that was funded almost exclusively by Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his relatives.\par \par \uc2 Washington Post\par \par \uc2 Caption: Senator Marco Rubio said last week that, if asked, he would not accept an offer to be Mitt Romney's running mate.
